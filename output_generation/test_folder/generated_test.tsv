0	New Insights in Recurrent HCV Infection after Liver Transplantation	1
1	The influence of HCV genotypes on HCV recurrence after LT had been assessed , but the results were still controversial	1
2	Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for HCV hepatitis after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [ 7 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
3	Another study by Gayowski et al	1
4	reported in their results that the rate of recurrent HCV hepatitis , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to @NE$ therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT HCV hepatitis [ 22 ] .	1
5	Recently , genetic variation in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19 , coding for IFN - 3 , has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with SVR in patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection who are treated with @NE$ plus @NE$ in the nontransplant setting [ 23 , 24 ]	1
6	IL28B polymorphism has also been associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [ 25 ]	1
7	One cohort study , Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive HCV patients undergoing LT , aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient IL28B genotypes among liver transplant recipients [ 26 ]	1
8	The authors suggested that recipient IL28B TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of HCV after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with HCV infection .	1
9	Reactivation of herpes group viruses may also be one of the factors associated with HCV recurrence after LT	1
10	Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and human herpes virus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation	1
11	They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [ 27 , 28 ]	1
12	Recently , a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients ( donor or recipient CMV seropositive ) transplanted for HCV was performed to evaluate the associations of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT	1
