Other primate species may have different exon numbering . Residue numbering corresponds to this reference sequence . 2 Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0 . 95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes ( BEB ) analysis in PAML from the F364 codon frequency model . 3 Estimated d / dS ratios from PAML . 4 Estimated errors for the indicated dN / dS ratio .
