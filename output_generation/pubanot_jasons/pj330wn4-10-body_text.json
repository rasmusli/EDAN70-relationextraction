Tissue was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes before readings . Beating cilia were recorded using a Motion Pro X4 digital high - speed video camera ( Lake Image Systems , Henrietta , N . Y . USA ) at a rate of 250 to 500 frames per second using an \u00d7 40 objective as previously described [ 18 ] . At least 512 or 1 , 024 frames were captured , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
