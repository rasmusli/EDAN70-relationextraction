To explore the possible benefits of different cell cycle phases for EV - D68 viral replication , we synchronized cells in different phases and then assessed viral replication and virulence . First , we assessed the effects of G0 / G1 synchronization by serum deprivation ( Darzynkiewicz et al . , 1980 ) . RD cells were cultured in either serum medium ( control ) or serum - free medium ( G0 / G synchronization ) for 24 h . Then the cells were infected with the same titer of 0 . 8 MOI of EV - D68 ( Fermon strain ) or were mock - infected for 2 h , and either serum medium or serum - free medium was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1A ) . As previously reported ( He et al . , 2010 ) , serum deprivation induced obvious G0 / G1 arrest as assessed by flow cytometry ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 1B ) . At 2 h post - infection ( viral entry stage ) , the EV - D68 genomic RNA levels were not significantly different in the control and serumstarved cells ( Figure 1M ) ; however , at 18 h post infection ( viral replication stage ) 13 . 55 times more viral RNA was detected in the serum - starved cells than in the control cells ( P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1C ) . Furthermore , at 24 h ( viral production stage ) the TCID50 / mL of infectious EV - D68 particles was 348 . 84 times higher for supernatant from G0 / G1 phase - synchronized cells ( 202 . 17 \u00b1 42 . 60 \u00d7 10 5 ) than for supernatant from control cells ( 0 . 59 \u00b1 0 . 08 \u00d7 10 5 ) ( P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1D ) . These results suggest that G0 / G1 - phase arrest does not affect viral entry , but promotes EV - D68 viral replication and production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
