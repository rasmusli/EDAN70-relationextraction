Following their tat - mediated cellular uptake into primary lymphocytes and macrophages , these inhibitory heptapeptides , expressed in fusion with stabilizing proteins , successfully suppressed HIV - 1 replication , although at a concentration higher than those of currently used antiviral drugs . Along with a better design of the peptide ligand , conjugation to other CPPs may improve cellular uptake and therefore antiviral activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 8}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 177}, "obj": "ne"}]}
