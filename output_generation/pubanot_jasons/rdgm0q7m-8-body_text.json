Single colonies were picked into Luria - Bertani broth and grown at 37 \u2022 C to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 . Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl [UNK] - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( to 0 . 1 mM ) and continued for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C ( or overnight at 22 \u2022 C ) after which cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 4 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mg / ml lysozyme ) . Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated to complete lysis . Protein purification was performed using Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ; Qiagen ) according to standard procedures ( 29 ) . Nterminally glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged nsp1 \u2424 was expressed in BL21 / DE3 / pLysS cells as above and purified using glutathione agarose resin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) according to standard procedures ( 30 ) . Proteins were dialysed against 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 05 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) and 5 % glycerol , quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay ( Pierce ) and stored at \u2212 80 \u2022 C until required .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 29}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 339}, "obj": "ne"}]}
