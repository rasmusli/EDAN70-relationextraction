Interestingly , we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [ 31 ] , in which we observed a glycine - to - arginine mutation in nsP1 . Given that polyamines are positively - charged at physiological pH , the emergence of positively - charged amino acids in polyamine - depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge . The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the active sites of either enzyme [ 27 , 38 ] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically . Precisely how positively - charged amino acids or polyamines contribute to protease activity remains unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 56}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 108}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 137}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 149}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 270}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 286}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 327}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 424}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 437}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 535}, "obj": "ne"}]}
