We used the freely available open - source ImageJ software to determine the average pixel intensity of up to 40 \u00d7 40 ROI per frame of the AVI file [ 20 ] . The ciliaFA plugin exports a dataset of up to 1 , 600 ROI to Excel 2007 ( Microsoft ; Redmond , WA , USA ) where a visual basic macro is initiated to perform the FFT . The complex number is translated using the Excel function ' = IMABS ( range ) ' and the dominant frequency within the range is then established using the function ' = MAX ( range ) ' . The CBF is determined by multiplying the row number by the frequency resolution ( FR ) ( frame rate of recording / number of frames ) , which we named the ' FFT Mag ' . In order to more accurately predict the CBF , we averaged the sum of the FFT Mag of the peaks flanking the maximum ( see Figure 1B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
