As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens , NF - \u03baB activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral , bacterial , and parasitic infections [ 1 ] . However , many viruses such as HIV , exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through \u03baB response elements located in their promoters [ 2 ] . On the contrary , many pathogens such as African swine fever virus , HIV - 1 and cowpox virus [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF - \u03baB responses . Inhibition of NF - \u03baB activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
