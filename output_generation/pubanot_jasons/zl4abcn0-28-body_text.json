The method was found to be accurate and repeatable and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples . The highest lycorine content in the wild plants was found in the bulb extract , whereas the least was in the root extract . Callus culture samples of H . littoralis had comparable lycorine content to that of wild plants . The results showed that 4 . 5 M 2 , 4 - D alone or a combination of 9 . 00 M with 4 . 5 M BAP was the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine content in callus culture .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 108}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 317}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 363}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 531}, "obj": "ne"}]}
