Transfer of ADP - ribose ( ADPr ) from NAD + ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) to proteins is catalyzed within eukaryotic cells by members of the PARP ( poly - ADP - ribose polymerase ) , or ARTD ( ADP - ribosyltransferase , diphtheria toxin - like ) protein family ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 5 ] . The best - studied PARPs , including the founding member PARP1 , catalyze the formation of long , branched chains of ADP - ribose known as poly - ADP - ribose ( PAR ) [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . These PAR - forming enzymes perform critical housekeeping functions , such as nucleation of DNA - damage foci ( PARP1 and 2 ) and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis ( PARP5a ) [ 7 , 8 ] . In contrast to these well - described functions , most human PARP proteins are poorly understood , in part due to their lack of conservation in model organisms such as C . elegans and D . melanogaster [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] . In total , 17 genes in the human genome contain PARP domains , with each gene containing a variety of other functional domains that likely endow each PARP with their individual functions ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 10 ] . Many of the poorly - characterized human PARP proteins are found in the cytoplasm [ 11 ] and are predicted to only catalyze addition of a single ADPr , rather than PAR , to proteins [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] . Several recent descriptions of PARP functions in cellular signaling , miRNA regulation and stress granule formation [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] suggest that many functions for cytoplasmic ADP - ribosylation , especially mono - ADP - ribosylation , likely remain uncharacterized . Moreover , the discovery that a subset of macrodomain containing proteins can , in addition to binding mono - ADP - ribosylated proteins , also remove mono - ADP - ribose from proteins [ 15 , 16 ] , sheds further light on the regulation and function of this dynamic PTM .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 33}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 158, "end": 171}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 178}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 227}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 323}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 373}, "obj": "ne"}]}
