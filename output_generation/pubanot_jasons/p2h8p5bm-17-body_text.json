Proteins involved in the RNAi mediated response such as Argonaute 30 ( Ago30 ) , Ago 16 and Dicer ( Dcr ) 90 were subsequently identified as inhibitors of LGTV [ 93 ] . Furthermore RNA - seq and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that when challenged by TBEV infection , tick cells upregulated genes involved in immunity and metabolism , whereas genes involved in cellular stress were downregulated [ 94 ] . Using gene silencing approaches , this study confirmed the antiviral effect of Ago 30 and Dcr 90 in tick cells . Furthermore , novel antiviral genes such as complement factor H , heat shock protein ( HSP ) 70 and 90 and trypsin was found to inhibit LGTV in tick cells [ 94 ] . Taken together , studies so far have identified activation and antiviral actions of the RNAi mediated response in tick cells as well as other inhibitory proteins such as HSP70 , HSP90 , and trypsin .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
