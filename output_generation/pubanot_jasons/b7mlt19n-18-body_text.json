Studies have shown that NS1 protein from Dengue virus type 2 ( DENV - 2 ) colocalizes with LC3 and that DENV - 2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection . 58 , 74 In contrast to DENV - 2 , NS1 protein from DENV - 3 displays a low level of colocalization with LC3 . 75 Sequence alignment of NS1 proteins from DENV - 2 and DENV - 3 showed that they are highly conserved . However , checking for the presence of LIR motifs revealed a discrepancy between them . We observed that DENV - 2 NS1 has an xLIR motif ( ASFIEV ) that is not recognized in any DENV - 3 NS1 sequences due to the substitution F to L , as well as an additional WxxL motif with a PSSM score 12 ( RAWNSL ) that is absent in DENV - 3 ( SL to VW ) ( Fig . S1 ) . It is possible that the absence of either the xLIR or WxxL motifs ( or both ) in DENV - 3 is responsible for its lower affinity to LC3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
