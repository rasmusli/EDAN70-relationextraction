Messenger RNAs were translated in nuclease - treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( RRL ) or wheat germ ( WG ) extracts ( Promega ) programmed with [UNK] 50 g / ml template mRNA . Typical reactions were of 10 l volume and composed of 90 % ( v / v ) RRL , 20 M amino acids ( lacking methionine ) and 0 . 2 MBq [ 35 S ] - methionine . Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 \u2022 C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 10mM EDTA , 100 g / ml RNase A followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min . Samples were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) by the addition of 10 volumes of 2 \u00d7 Laemmli ' s sample buffer , boiled for 4 min and resolved by SDS - PAGE . Dried gels were exposed to a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Screen ( PerkinElmer ) , the screen scanned using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager ( GE Healthcare ) in storage phosphor autoradiography mode and bands were quantified using ImageQuant TM TL software ( GE Healthcare ) . The calculations of frameshifting efficiency ( % FS ) took into account the differential methionine content of the various products and % FS was calculated as % \u2212 1FS", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 414}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 435}, "obj": "ne"}]}
