The virus was then passed to new cells by transferring 50 \u00b5L supernatant . After five passages , RNA was extracted and purified from supernatants and reverse transcribed . Sanger sequencing was used to determine whether mutations were stable over the passages by looking at the chromatograms and determining the presence or absence of the mutant nucleotide . Fitness assays were similarly performed , but Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0 . 1 with an equal combination of wild - type and mutant CVB3 and passaged five times . Fitness was determined via Sanger sequencing and analysis of the chromatogram to determine if the wild - type or mutant nucleotide was present in the sample .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 486}, "obj": "ne"}]}
