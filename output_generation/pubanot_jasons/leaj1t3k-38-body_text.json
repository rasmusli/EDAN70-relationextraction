The remarkable antiviral effects of PPMOs against lethal infections with EBOV , VEEV , FLUAV and DENV , and against the usually - lethal infections with PV1 and WNV , call for a wider use of CPPs in the delivery of antiviral drugs . CPP - conjugated antivirals also show promise in inhibiting the reactivation from latent infections of viruses such as H - 1 . Moreover , the assessment of CPP antiviral properties and the understanding of their molecular mechanisms could lead to the exploitation of these activities for the development of microbicides to inactivate virions after exposure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 58}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 223}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 372, "end": 377}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 418}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 535}, "obj": "ne"}]}
