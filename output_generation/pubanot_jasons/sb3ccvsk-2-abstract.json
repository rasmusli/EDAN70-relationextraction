Epitope spreading , molecular mimicry , cryptic antigen , and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self - reactive ( SR ) immune cells , ultimately leading to organ - specific autoimmune disease . Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus ( JHMV ) - induced demyelination , this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells . In this model , immune - mediated demyelination is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control . However , their decline during persisting infection , despite ongoing demyelination , suggests an active control mechanism . Antigen - specific IL - 10 - secreting CD4 + T cells ( Tr1 ) and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , both known to control autoimmunity and induced following JHMV infection , were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells . Ablation of Foxp3 + Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4 + T cells within cervical lymph nodes ( CLN ) , albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls . In contrast , infected IL - 27 receptor deficient ( IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 ) mice , characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells , revealed that SR CD4 + T cells in CLN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS . These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T - cell - mediated autoimmune pathology . The JHMV model is thus valuable to decipher tissue - specific mechanisms preventing autoimmunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
