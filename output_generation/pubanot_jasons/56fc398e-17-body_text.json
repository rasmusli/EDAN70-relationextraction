In TNS , we sample specific nodes based on certain criteria . In this case , we chose the weighted - degree of the node . All nodes having a weighted - degree of at least x are sampled and their neighbours are captured ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1 ) . A graphical depiction of the three node sampling network schemes is shown in the electronic supplementary material , figure S2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
