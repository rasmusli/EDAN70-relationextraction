The infectivity of viral particles was then assessed by measuring the amount of GFP - positive cells 3 days afterwards . Even using different target cells , viruses produced in the presence of IFITMs displayed a characteristic decrease in infectivity , indicating that this phenomenon is independent from the target cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
