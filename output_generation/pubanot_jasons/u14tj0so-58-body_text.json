Figure 2 shows the results of this robustness evaluation , for pseudoknotted structures ( Figure 2A ) , pseudoknot - free structures ( Figure 2B ) and the overall results ( Figure 2C ) . Since HFold - PKonly cannot add pseudoknot - free base pairs to the given input structure , we do not compare its performance here with HFold and Iterative HFold . However we provide detailed performance of all versions of HFold including HFold - PKonly in Additional file 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
