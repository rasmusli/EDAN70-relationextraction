Although genome wide searches and similar techniques have not been definitive , genes involved with B cell activation , such as CD40 and the B lymphocyte kinase ( BLK ) , have been identified [ 55 , 56 ] . There is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [ 57 ] . In this review we will focus on the literature surrounding these recent reports of antibody reactive cellular inclusions and B cell involvement .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
