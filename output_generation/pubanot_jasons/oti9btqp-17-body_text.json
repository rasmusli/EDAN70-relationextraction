ZIKV strains ( MR766 or PR209 ) were pre - incubated in sera or diluted RM - immune sera and added to monolayers of each cell type . Protection against ZIKV infection and disease in IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice following ZIK - prME immunisation In exploratory studies , 5 - 6 - week - old IFNAR ( \u2212 / \u2212 ) mice ( n = 10 ) were challenged with 1 \u00d7 10 6 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of the ZIKV - PR209 isolate , administered by either subcutaneous ( s . c . ) ; intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) ; intracranial ( i . c ) ; or intravenous ( i . v . ) routes . After the challenge , all the animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection , which included routine measurement of body weight as well as inspection for other signs of a moribund condition such as hind limb weakness and paralysis . No change in the general appearance of the mice was observed during the first 4 days after inoculation . However , after the fourth day , the mice in each of the groups demonstrated reduced overall activity , decreased mobility and a hunched posture often accompanied by hind - limb weakness , decreased water intake and obvious weight loss . The animals succumbed to the infection between day 6 and day 8 regardless of the route of viral challenge ( Supplementary Figure S5A - E ) . On the basis of these data , the subsequent studies to evaluate ZIKV - prME - mediated protection in this model used the s . c . route for challenge .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
