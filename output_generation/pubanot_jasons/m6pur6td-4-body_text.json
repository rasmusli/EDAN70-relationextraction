Therefore , comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city - level carbon emissions accounting , as well as local emission mitigation strategies [ 28 ] . The second strand of research focuses on the city - level driving factors and influencing mechanisms . Decomposition analysis ( e . g . Index Decomposition Analysis ( IDA ) and Structural Decomposition Analysis ( SDA ) ) and regression method ( e . g . Stochastic impacts by re on population , affluence , and technology ( STIRPAT ) model ) are the most commonly applied methods for the scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis of factors influencing city - level carbon emissions , especially the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index ( LMDI ) method based on the IDA framework . As shown in Table 1 , the SDA method based on the IO technique applied in the city - level driving factors and influencing mechanisms research in China were mainly focused on the four municipalities ( i . e . Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin and Chongqing ) , because of the available IO data base compiled by the Municipality Bureau of", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
