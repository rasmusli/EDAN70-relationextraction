The pupae were then incubated at 34 . 5 \u2022 C , \u2265 50 % relative humidity and darkness for seven days [ 53 ] and afterward frozen at \u2212 80 \u2022 C . The DWV solution was prepared by homogenizing a DWV symptomatic honeybee in PBS and chloroform , followed by centrifugation ( 15800 rcf for 10 min ) . The supernatant was collected , diluted 1 : 1000 , and frozen at \u2212 80 \u2022 C before injection into the pupae [ 52 ] . For the injected honeybee pupae used as food and positive controls for the virus detection , the logarithmic mean number of viral copies was 11 . 49 \u00b1 0 . 29 and DWV type - specific primers showed a ratio of 5 . 88 / 1 for DWV - B to DWV - A , but no DWV - C .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 234}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 392}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 436}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 479}, "obj": "ne"}]}
