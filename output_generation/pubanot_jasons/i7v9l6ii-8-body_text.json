This panel covered 11 different serotypes of Influenza virus and 11 viral serotypes among 6 viruses suspected to cause common upper respiratory tract infections ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Target specific cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcriptase primer plex kit and for the GenomeLab GeXP start kit ( Beckman Coulter ) . Reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction was performed in 20\u00b5L reaction volume using 12\u00b5L of extracted nucleic acid , 4\u00b5L of GeXP 5X RT buffer , 2\u00b5L of RT primer plex and 1\u00b5L each of undiluted Kan - r and reverse transcriptase enzyme . The reaction was initiated at 48 o C for 1 minute followed by 42 o C for 60 minutes and terminated at 95 o C for 5 minutes ; the synthesised cDNA was kept at 4 o C before using for PCR analysis . PCR reaction was performed in 20\u00b5L reaction volume using 9 . 3\u00b5L of synthesized cDNA , 4\u00b5L 5X PCR buffer , 4\u00b5L , 25mM MgCl 2 , 2\u00b5L PCR primer plex and 0 . 7\u00b5L of Thermo Start DNA polymerase ( Thermo Scientific Inc . Fullerton , CA , USA ) . The PCR reaction was initiated at 95 o C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds , 55 o C for 30 seconds and 70 o C for 1 minute . The PCR product was maintained at 4 o C prior to fragment analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
