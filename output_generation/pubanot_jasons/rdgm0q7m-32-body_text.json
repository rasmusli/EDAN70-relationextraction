The participation of hnRNPs in each case may reflect the versatility of these proteins in linking sequence - specific nucleic acid binding with specific protein - protein interactions and serving as a fulcrum for multilateral molecular cross - talk ( 58 ) . It seems highly unlikely that protein - mediated recoding will be restricted to the two present examples , given the plethora of hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins present in host and viral proteomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
