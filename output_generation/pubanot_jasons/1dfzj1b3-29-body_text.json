The percentage inhibition of Salvia eremophila Boiss . oil was of about one third of that of BHT , in contrast to the methanolic extracts of the same plant , which presented activities comparable to that of BHT . The authors considered the absence of phenolic compounds in the oils responsible for such weak activity . \u03b1 - Pinene , borneol , camphene and transcaryophyllene were the main components of the oil [ 48 ] . For the Psammogeton canescens ( DC . ) vatke oil the authors [ 49 ] also attributed the weak activity of the oils to the presence of \u03b2 - bisabolene , apiole , \u03b1 - pinene and dill apiole , all non - phenolic compounds .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 248}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 358, "end": 362}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 481}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 491}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 502}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 525}, "obj": "ne"}]}
