Almost all studies conducted on isolates from pigs worldwide to screen mcr - 1 gene presence in enterobacterial species reported that colistin resistant isolates harboring this gene also showed resistance to one or several classes of antimicrobials conventionally used in swine such as : aminoglycoside , sulphonamide , trimethoprim , tetracycline , quinolone , lincosamide , \u03b2 - lactam , and third generation cephalosporin [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 17}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 163}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 221}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 311}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 566}, "obj": "ne"}]}
