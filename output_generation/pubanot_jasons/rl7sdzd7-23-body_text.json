Reactions were performed in 20 \u03bcl containing 1 \u00d7 Bst pol buffer ( NEB , Ipswich , UK ) with 0 . 4 mM each dNTP with the appropriate primers listed in Table 1 : Displacement primers were each used at a concentration of 0 . 2 \u03bcM ; Loop primers at 0 . 4 \u03bcM and LAMP primers at 0 . 8 \u03bcM in the reactions . Enough reaction reagents , without template and enzyme , were mixed together and split into two . Te ( 1 \u03bcl ) was added to 9 \u03bcl of the mix and the samples denatured at 95 \u00b0 C for 2 mins and then cooled to 4 \u00b0 C . Bst pol was added to the remaining reaction mix to a concentration of 3 . 2 U . \u03bcl - 1 , mixed thoroughly , and 10 \u03bcl was added to each reaction . Reactions were incubated at 55 \u00b0 C for 2 hours , followed by 80 \u00b0 C for 10 mins to inactivate the enzyme and stored at 4 \u00b0 C until analysed . Aliquots of the reactions ( 5 \u03bcl ) were run on 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) agarose gels , containing ethidium bromide", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 187}, "obj": "ne"}]}
