The main components in both cases were p - cymene , \u03b3 - terpinene , linalool , thymol and carvacrol . The percentages changed according to the method of extraction used , nevertheless p - cymene and thymol dominated in both cases . The great difference was found to be the presence of thymoquinone in the volatile oil obtained through the supercritic fluid extraction . The presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test , in which the lipidic substrate was sunflower oil [ 60 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 250}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 252, "end": 266}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 277}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 286}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 300}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 395}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 406}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 498}, "obj": "ne"}]}
