These results are consistent with the findings of Nelson et a l . who showed that PPMOs exhibited antisense activity 3 - to 25 - fold higher than corresponding PMOs while bearing lower off - target effects [ 87 ] . The authors propose that the arginine - rich peptides enhance RNA - PMO binding affinity thereby increasing specific antisense activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 48}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 272}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 428, "end": 437}, "obj": "ne"}]}
