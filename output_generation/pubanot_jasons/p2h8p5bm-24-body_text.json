Absence of IPS - 1 resulted in a lower systemic IFN\u03b1 response , which correlated with higher viral replication in the peripheral tissues [ 128 ] . Furthermore , IPS - 1 was shown to be of particular importance for the IFN production locally within the brain , where IPS - 1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice had lower induction of IFN\u03b2 within the olfactory bulb despite higher viral burdens [ 128 ] . Furthermore , IFN\u03b2 induction was shown to be completely dependent on IPS - 1 and IRF3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and viral recognition through the IPS - 1 - pathway was shown to be dependent on RIG - I and not MDA - 5 in human osteosarcoma cells ( U2OS ) [ 80 , 83 ] . Interestingly , RIG - I has been shown to co - localize with stress granules ( SG ) during TBEV infection [ 129 ] . SG contains ribonucleoprotein aggregates with translationally stalled mRNAs , 40S ribosomes , and several RNA - binding proteins . SG function to prevent the generation of defective proteins [ 130 ] . SG are induced during TBEV infection and SG components TIA - 1 / TIAR was found to bind viral RNA and inhibit viral translation [ 131 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
