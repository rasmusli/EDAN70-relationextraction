Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated IL - 6 expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of IL - 6 in the muscle ( Fig . 7C ) . These chemokines downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral - induced pathogenesis , and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 170}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 408}, "obj": "ne"}]}
