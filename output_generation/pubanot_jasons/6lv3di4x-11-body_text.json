Consequently , we determined the monocyte chemoattractant . The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate . Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals . Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P [UNK] 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Na , respectively ) ; differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P \u0545 0 . 05 ; * * , P \u0545 0 . 002 ; * * * , P \u0545 0 . 001 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
