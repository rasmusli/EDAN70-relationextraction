The meshes were automatically generated by Gambit according to the mesh type and maximum mesh size . The whole region around the seated passengers and the standing person were meshed by unstructured grids of tetrahedron . The maximum mesh size was 0 . 03 m and the total number was 9 , 098 , 636 . Other parts of the cabin ( the aisle behind and in front of the standing person ) were meshed by structured grids of hexahedron . The maximum mesh size was 0 . 025 m and the total number was 99 , 264 . The grid system was chosen based on the grid convergence index ( GCI ) analysis [ 21 ] . By comparing the computed velocity magnitudes at 800 selected points in the GCI analysis , finer grid system did not have much improvement in GCI compared to the selected grid system ( GCI finer < 5 % ) [ 22 ] . So a grid system containing 9 , 197 , 900 cells was finally adopted in this computational geometry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 161}, "obj": "ne"}]}
