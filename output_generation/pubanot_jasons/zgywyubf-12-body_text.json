ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho I\u03baB\u03b1 ( Figure 2C , upper panel , lane 1 and 2 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below ) as well as the level of total I\u03baB\u03b1 ( middle panel , lane 1 and 2 ) . In IKK and ORF2 co - expressing cells , the level of total as well as phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly higher as compared to only IKK\u03b2 expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4 ) . In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 , one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG - 132 for 2 hours , resulting in equal I\u03baB\u03b1 protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6 ) . Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti - calnexin antibody to check equal loading . Thus , it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 . The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex . ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKK\u03b1 / \u03b2 ( ser180 / 181 ) levels . As expected , ORF2 expression ( 2 or 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA transfection ) did not modulate the levels of pIKK \u03b1 / \u03b2 ( Figure 2D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
