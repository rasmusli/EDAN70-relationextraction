In the DPPH method , the antioxidant activity of clove oil was higher than the volatile aglycone fraction , although both samples have high eugenol content . This lower activity could be attributed and according to the authors to the antagonism among other constituents present in small amounts in this fraction . The reducing capacity of the essential oil was also higher than that of the volatile aglycone fraction . Nevertheless in this assay the reference eugenol had weak ability , whereas in the DPPH method it possessed considerable activity . Such a difference could be explained by the different polarity for FRAP method compared with DPPH method . \" Waterlike \" solvents induce a dramatic decrease in the hydrogen atom - donating capability in comparison with ethyl alcohol used in DPPH method [ 80 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 36}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 324}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 345}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 430}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 481}, "obj": "ne"}]}
