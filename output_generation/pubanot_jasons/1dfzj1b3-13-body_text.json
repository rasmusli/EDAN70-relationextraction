This method measures the malonaldehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition , which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) . However , TBARS is representative of a rather late stage of lipid oxidation , when the oxidation substrate has undergone substantial transformation [ 29 ] . There are other methods , including the determination of peroxide value , iodine value , chromatographic measurement of volatile compounds , formic acid measurement [ the Rancimat method in an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids ( formic acid ) produced during the auto - oxidation of lipids at 100 \u00baC or above ] [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 167}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 236}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 269}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 341}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 343, "end": 347}, "obj": "ne"}]}
