They used about 30 components from 80 that are described as possessing antioxidant activity and the results confirmed that this computational technique was reliable for predicting the antioxidant activity of essential oils from some of its components . Some of them are also reported in the present work ( thymol , carvacrol , eugenol , pcymene ) among others . Nevertheless , the authors only tested two models . There are much more , those that allow evaluating the ability for scavenging ROS or RNS or chelating metals . In this way , the work is not finished and much more needs to be done .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 256}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 274}, "obj": "ne"}]}
