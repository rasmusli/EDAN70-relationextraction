This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns . Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of MERS - CoV cases , and currently , no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment . A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus , its structure , route of transmission and its pathophysiology . Therefore , this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS - CoV ' s pathogenesis , treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments , and the major steps taken for MERS prevention control . Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses , and while most of these infect animals , particularly bats , a minor number can also cause human diseases [ 16 ] . Human coronaviruses can be broadly divided into types , \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronavirus [ 17 ] . MERS - CoV is from the \u03b2 - coronavirus family [ 18 ] . It has four major surface proteins that help the virus to enter the cells viz . envelope protein ( E ) , spike ( S ) protein , nucleocapsid ( N ) protein and membrane ( M ) protein . The spike ( S ) protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein made up of S1 and S2 subunits . The S protein is crucial for virus entry through binding and fusion to host cells . The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain ( RBD ) that binds with the DPP4 receptor of the host [ 18 , 19 ] . The S2 subunit contains heptad repeats H1 and H2 which forms the main membrane fusion unit [ 20 ] . The E protein is required for assembly , intracellular transport and budding of virus [ 21 ] . The M protein has its role in viral morphogenesis and assembly [ 22 ] . N proteins and S , E and M proteins interact to form complete virus particles [ 23 ] . In addition to these structural proteins , MERS - CoV has two large polyproteins called pp1a and pp1ab . These proteins are broken down by proteases to form various nonstructural essential proteins , such as enzymes [ 24 , 25 ] . Recent studies have revealed that these viral structural and nonstructural proteins can be exploited as novel targets for therapeutic purposes [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
