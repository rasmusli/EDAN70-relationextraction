However , sufficient data on the distinctive characteristics of Adv infections in immunocompetent patients is currently unavailable . We previously observed that adenoviruspositive community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) patients have a high fever and respond differently to antipyretic treatment compared to CAP patients who test positive for other viruses or bacteria . Therefore , the primary goal of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of Adv - and Non - Adv - positive CAP patients among immuno military personnel and to identify the distinctive characteristics .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
