The first crystal structure of sialidase with a geranylated flavonoid provides structural insights into the binding mode of natural flavonoid - based inhibitors at atomic resolution . The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors . First , the 3 0 - hydroxyl group stabilizes the enzyme - inhibitor complex through hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Ala292 . Secondly , additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe353 , Trp354 and Tyr587 in the active site . Importantly , in the four variants of human sialidase this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group . Glu111 , Tyr179 and Tyr181 of human Neu2 are not conserved in bacterial and viral sialidases and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses ( Burmeister et al . , 1993 ) . However , our biochemical and structural data suggest that the hydrophobic binding pocket of Cp - NanI which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus human sialidases . Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 62}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 73}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 103}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 288}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 360}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 445}, "obj": "ne"}]}
