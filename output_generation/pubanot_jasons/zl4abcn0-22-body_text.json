Different concentrations of acetic acid ranging from 0 . 25 to 1 % and formic acid ranging from 0 . 25 to 0 . 5 % were added into the mobile phase . In addition , the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1 % ammonium acetate buffer . It was found that 1 % ammonium acetate buffer without any addition of acetic acid or formic acid was the optimum mobile phase for separation of lycorine . Therefore , the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile - 1 % ammonium acetate ( 15 : 85 v / v ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 45}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 60}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 178}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 221}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 356}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 387}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 435}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 478}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 493}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 549}, "obj": "ne"}]}
