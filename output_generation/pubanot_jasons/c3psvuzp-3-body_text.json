As a result , pathogens have evolved mechanisms to block , reverse or usurp this machinery in order to successfully replicate within their hosts [ 1 ] . For example , numerous viruses subvert the dynamics of phosphorylation , employing kinases , substrate mimics and phosphatases to disrupt host signaling [ 1 ] . Likewise , addition and removal of acetyl groups by histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) and deacetylases ( HDACs ) can have a dramatic effect on viruses such as HIV , herpesviruses , polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses . In response , several viral classes encode proteins to specifically disrupt host phosphorylation and acetylation [ 2 ] . Beyond small - molecule PTMs , conjugation and cleavage of ubiquitin and ubiquitin - like molecules has emerged as an important point of cellular regulation that several viruses target or subvert in order to replicate [ 3 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
