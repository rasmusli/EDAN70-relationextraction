To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of these DIs on the in vitro processing of HIV - 1 Gag . Purified VLPs derived from the p [UNK] R PR \u2212 construct [ 32 ] , encoding a protease deficient HIV - 1 mutant virus , were lysed and incubated with 2 . 56 \u00b5M of the HIV - 1 PR . No effect on the protease activity was observed for PR - 619 or P22077 ( In contrast , addition of the DI P5091 , which is selective for USP7 , had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ) . Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2 - fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR - 619 , whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication . Although the DI P22077 and PR - 619 clearly reduced Gag processing , none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 153}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 163}, "obj": "ne"}]}
