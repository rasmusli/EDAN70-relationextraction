Our study demonstrates that the full - length core protein has better reactivity than C22 . It is possible that the C - terminal domain of the core protein contains key peptide sequences for constructing the viral particle and regulating viral assembly ( 4 , 20 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
