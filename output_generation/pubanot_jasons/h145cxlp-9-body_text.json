For the latter , respiratory samples were placed in a viral transport medium ( Mast Diagnostica GmbH , Reinfeld , Germany ) . At the central laboratory , they were tested using the commercial multiplex PCR ' FTD \u00ae Respiratory pathogens 21 ' ( Fast Track Diagnostics , Luxembourg ) to screen for respiratory viruses ( sensitivity and specificity of 99 - 100 % compared to singleplex PCR assays for all included viruses in clinical samples ) . Pathogens detected by the test kit included influenza A and B viruses , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , parainfluenza virus ( PIV ) 1 - 4 , coronavirus ( CoV ) NL63 , OC43 , HKU1 , and 229E , human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) , human bocavirus ( hBoV ) , adenovirus ( AdV ) , rhinovirus ( RhV ) , enterovirus ( EV ) , parechovirus ( PV ) , and additionally Mykoplasma pneumoniae . Samples positive for influenza A and B virus RNA in the multiplex PCR were further analysed to determine the subtype and lineage , respectively . Primers and probes specific for influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 were included in the ' FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 ' kit . All samples positive for influenza A virus RNA but negative for influenza A virus ( H1N1 ) pdm09 RNA were tested by a PCR specific for influenza A virus H3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
