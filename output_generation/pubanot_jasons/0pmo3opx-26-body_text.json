The peptides used in this study were custom synthesized by AAPPTEC of Louisville , KY using traditional Fmoc solid - phase peptide synthesis 40 . All of the peptides were purified and characterized by AAPPTEC . The peptides used in all of the studies were greater than > 95 % purity as determined by high - performance liquid chromatography . Inhibition assays were performed in triplicate in a 100 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , Brij 35 0 . 0002 % w / v assay buffer at 37 \u00b0 C with 0 . 1 \u03bcM APN and 100 \u03bcM H - Ala - AMC ( fluorophore ) . Values were recorded by Infinite pro plate reader every 2 minutes for 30 minutes with laser parameters set for excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm . As the inhibition of APN was competitive , the values for the inhibition constant , K i , were determined from the IC50 using the Cheng - Prusoff equation : K i = IC 50 / ( 1 + [ S ] / Km ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 109}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 251}, "obj": "ne"}]}
