One explanation for this phenomenon would be that DIs directly inhibit the viral protease . However , this possibility could be excluded as in vitro processing assays revealed that the applied DIs , even at high concentrations , had no effect on the viral protease . Another explanation might be that polyubiquitin chains conjugated to Gag sterically disturb the highly ordered lattice of assembling Gag and thus exert a negative effect on the highly ordered Gag - assembly during virus buddin , and eventually also on the auto - activation of the viral protease . Another possibility may be the direct masking of the viral protease cleavage sites by bulky polyubiquitin adducts . Accumulation of processing intermediates has been shown previously to interfere with viral infectivity in a trans - dominant negative manner [ 61 ] , which is in concert with our observations that treatment with DIs P22077 and PR - 619 reduces virus infectivity in a dose - dependent manner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 37}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 131}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 274}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 392}, "obj": "ne"}]}
