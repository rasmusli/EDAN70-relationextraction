The main components of male leaf essential oil were \u03b1 - pinene / \u03b1 - thujene , spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene . The major component of female leaf essential oil was \u03b4 - 3 - carene . The seasonal variation showed that most of the main components of the oils reached theirs highest values in September . The highest antioxidant capacity to scavenge free DPPH radicals was reached in the month of June for male oils and during the months of September - October for the female oils . The high reducing power for male oil was detected during the month of June and for the female oil was in August . The antioxidant activity of the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay [ 81 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 232}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 246}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 260}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 282}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 352}, "obj": "ne"}]}
