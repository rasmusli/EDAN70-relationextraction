For this purpose we generate subset structures of the corresponding G big , for each RNA sequence in the HK - PK and HK - PK - free data sets . For each \u03b1 , 0 . 05 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0 . 95 with 0 . 05 steps , we choose each base pair of G big structure with probability \u03b1 . We also generate 1 % information and 99 % information about the G big structure ( i . e . , \u03b1 = 0 . 01 and \u03b1 = 0 . 99 ) . We repeat this step 100 times to generate 100 substructures of G big for each value of \u03b1 for each RNA sequence in our data sets . We then run our methods on all 100 substructures for each RNA sequence in our data sets and \u03b1 value and calculate the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average F - measure of these 100 cases as the accuracy interval for each method and each RNA sequence and \u03b1 value in our data set . We also compare our methods when the true pseudoknot - free structure , G big is provided .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
