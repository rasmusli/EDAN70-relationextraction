RNA was extracted from NEC and gene expression of chemokines was determined by RT - qPCR for CCL2 ( A ) , CCL5 ( B ) , and CXCL10 ( C ) . Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and [UNK] % confidence intervals . Basolateral medium from porcine NEC at 72 hpi was used for chemotaxis experiments . ( D ) Mean values \u03ee SD are shown , with different superscript letters indicating significant difference ( P \u0545 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama , respectively ) ; differences between distinct JEV strains and mock at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P \u0545 0 . 05 ; * * , P \u0545 0 . 002 ; * * * , P \u0545 0 . 001 ) . that such cultures released monocyte chemoattractant factors , we next investigated infection of monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM ) to mimic the possible subsequent in vivo cellular target following infection of NEC . Importantly , resting mucosal tissue resident macrophages have been described to have an \" M2 - like \" functional status resembling that of IL - 4 - polarized macrophages ( 40 , 41 ) . We therefore tested the infectivity of JEV released from NEC cultures for both nonpolarized and IL - 4 - polarized macrophages . To also assess potential additional factors released from the infected NEC cultures , we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from Vero cell - propagated virus . Of note , the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 10}, "obj": "ne"}]}
