First , the negative - sense strand RNA was tagged and then amplified : The cDNA of all T1 and T2 colonies sampled at Week 13 and 16 were obtained by using Superscript \u00ae III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) following the manufacturer ' s recommendations ( 1 \u00b5L of DWV 3F tagged primer , Table 1 , 1 \u00b5L dNTP 10 mM , 4 \u00b5L of 5 \u00d7 first strand buffer , 2 \u00b5L 0 . 1 M DTT , 1 \u00b5L M - MLV reverse transcriptase , H 2 O and sample in a final reaction volume of 20 \u00b5L ) [ 52 ] . The reaction was processed in a thermocycler ( Biometra ; Analytik Jena , Jena , Germany ) according to the following protocol : 5 min at 65 \u2022 C , 10 min at 25 \u2022 C , 60 min at 50 \u2022 C followed by 15 min at 70 \u2022 C . The obtained cDNA then was purified using the NucleoSpin \u00ae Gel & PCR Clean - up kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) and eluted in 30 \u00b5L elution buffer to avoid false - positive results . A five - fold dilution of the purified cDNA was used for the subsequent amplification with conventional PCR ( MyTay \u2122 kit by Bioline , London , UK ) . DWV - R1 was used as the reverse primer , while a Tag oligonucleotide ( Table 1 ) was used as forward primer . For each sample , a second reaction was carried out without forward primer to check for efficient removal of DWV 3F tagged primer after the reverse transcription . The thermal cycling was done with a profile that consisted of 2 min incubation at 95 \u2022 C and 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 \u2022 C for denaturation , 20 s at 42 \u2022 C for annealing , and 30 s at 72 \u2022 C for extension . By electrophoresis on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel , the PCR products were analyzed and visually checked under UV light . If a clear band was present at 221 bp and the associated negative control was indeed negative , a sample was considered positive .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 76}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 396}, "obj": "ne"}]}
