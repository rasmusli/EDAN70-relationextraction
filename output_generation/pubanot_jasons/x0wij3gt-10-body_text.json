In the presence of Ampli - Taq Gold DNA polymerase ( ABI Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50 \u00b0 C followed by 10 min at 95 \u00b0 C . Then the reaction was run for 40 cycles at 15 s , 95 \u00b0 C and 1 min , 60 \u00b0 C per cycle ( Table 1 ) . Assays - on - Demand \u2122 primers and probes specific for the oxytocin receptor ( Applied Biosystems ; ID number Hs00168573 - m1 ) were used in the PCR . GAPDH was measured and used to normalize all samples using the \u0394\u0394CT method ( Applied Biosystems ) . Gene expression of PDK1 is expressed relative to GAPDH and untreated samples in each stimulation study , respectively . At least three replicates were run for each condition .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
