To compare categorical variables or outcomes , such as the occurrence of infection or in - hospital death , between the IVIG group ( n = 28 patients ) and the control group , which included 29 patients who did not receive IVIG therapy , the chisquared test was used . For inter - group comparisons of continuous data , the two - tailed two - sample t test was generally performed . If the original data exhibited a lognor distribution , e . g . , ICU length of stay ( LOS ) , then raw data were log - transformed prior to analysis with the t test . A p value < 0 . 05 was assumed to indicate a statistically significant difference between the groups . The data analysis was performed using JMP \u00ae 11 . 0 statistical software ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC , USA ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
