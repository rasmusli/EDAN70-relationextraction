From the 28 essential oils evaluated , only Thymus zygis ssp . sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in diferent places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity > 50 % . In Thymus zygis ssp . sylvestris prevailed thymol or carvacrol , whereas in Thymus capitella oils , borneol and 1 , 8 - cineole dominated . Such results seem to indicate that the phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion , as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 15}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 112}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 123}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 301}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 386}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 399}, "obj": "ne"}]}
