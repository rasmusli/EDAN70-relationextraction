CVB3 commonly infects children , resulting in a self - limiting illness that can lead to the development of muscle , lung , and heart maladies . Importantly , CVB3 infection can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis , and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [ 1 , 2 ] . Currently , no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection ; thus , the identification of novel antivir targets is crucial to controlling infection . Viral proteases , including enteroviral proteases , play crucial roles in the replication of RNA viruses [ 3 ] . Following virus entry , picornavirus RNA is directly translated via host ribosomes into a polyprotein , containing both structural and nonstructural proteins . This large protein is subsequently cleaved to generate functionally distinct viral proteins . Importantly , the ability of viral proteases to cleave the viral polyprotein is essential for productive infection , as limiting viral protease activity significantly hinders virus infection . Modulation of protease activity , however , can also alter antiviral susceptibility [ 4 ] . Additionally , viral proteins cleave several host proteins , including translation factors , immune effectors , and signaling molecules [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] , to establish a proviral environment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
