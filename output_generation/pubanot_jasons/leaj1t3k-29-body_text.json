They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs . Surprisingly , unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate . In vi vo antiviral activity of PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 72}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 90}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 109}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 117}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 372}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 491}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 542}, "obj": "ne"}]}
