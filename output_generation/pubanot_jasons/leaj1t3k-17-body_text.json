They investigated the antiviral activities of five ( RXR ) 4 XB - conjugated PMOs directed against three HSV - 1 immediate - early genes , ICP0 , ICP4 and ICP27 crucial for HSV - 1 replication . The most potent PPMOs designed against ICP0 or ICP27 strongly inhibited HSV - 1 replication in cell culture by reducing viral protein expression ( Figure 1 ) . In particular , ICP0 PPMO was able to suppress the replication of several HSV - 1 strains , including an acyclovir - resistant strain . The authors also tested ICP0 PPMO in a mouse model of ocular herpes infection . Topical application of 10 \u03bcg ICP0 PPMO to the eyes of HSV - 1 infected mice inhibited virus replication in mouse eyes and reduced the incidence of eye disease by 37 . 5 - 50 % , thereby preventing death associated with HSV - 1 eye infection . To evaluate in vivo PPMO toxicity , the investigators applied 100 \u03bcg ICP0 PPMO ( ten times the antiviral dose ) daily to the eyes of uninfected mice . No gross or microscopic eye damage , no effect on body weight and temperature and no change of behavior were observed following the seven - day treatment . These results strengthen the potential of PPMOs as a treatment for recurring corneal disease from HSV - 1 reactivation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 195}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 348}, "obj": "ne"}]}
