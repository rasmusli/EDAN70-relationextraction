Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular protease activity and , as a result , leaf senescence [ 41 ] . The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells , though . For instance , spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [ 32 , 33 ] . Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of proteases , especially viral proteases , has not been fully explored ; however , our work suggests that viral proteases may be modulated by polyamines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 37}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 134}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 256}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 376}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 477}, "obj": "ne"}]}
