Hsu cells were pre - treated with MG132 at various concentrations ( 0 . 1 , 1 , 10 \u03bcM ) for 1 h prior to WNV infection . Total RNA and supernatant medium were collected at 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard errors from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and MG132 treated cells ) . B . Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media from cells treated as in A . Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 compared to control ) . C . Hsu cells were pre - treated with MG132 at various concentrations ( 0 . 1 , 1 , 10 \u03bcM ) for 1 h prior to infection with WNV at 4 \u00b0 C . Cells were moved to 30 \u00b0 C and total RNA was collected at 6 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and MG132 treated cells ) . D . Hsu cells were infected with WNV , followed by treatment with 10 \u03bcM MG132 at 2 , 4 or 6 hpi . Total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and MG132 - treated cells ) . performed on the supernatant media showed a similar dose - dependent decrease in viral titers , with a 20 - fold reduction in cells treated with 10 \u03bcM MG132 ( 30 pfu / ml ) compared to untreated controls ( 600 pfu / ml ) ( Fig 2B ) . These results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 104}, "obj": "ne"}]}
