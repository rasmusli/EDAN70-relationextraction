Several human coronaviruses have been identified , causing mainly mild respiratory infections , with the exception of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) . In addition , coronavirus infections have an economic impact on livestock industries worldwide . The avian coronavirus , infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) , causes infectious OPEN ACCESS bronchitis ( IB ) , a mild respiratory infection , but as a consequence is responsible for serious effects on the global poultry industries due to poor weight gain in broiler chickens as well as reduced egg production and egg quality in layers . In addition , some strains of IBV are nephropathogenic whilst others result in severe pathology in the reproductive organs . Bovine coronavirus ( BCoV ) causes respiratory infection and diarrhoea in cattle , transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( PEDV ) cause diarrhoea in pigs and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( PHEV ) causes vomiting and wasting disease in pigs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
