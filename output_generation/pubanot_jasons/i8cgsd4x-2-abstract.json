It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response . Here , we have used an RNA - Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following West Nile virus ( WNV ) infection , identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated . Ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway genes , comprising 12 % of total differentially regulated genes , were selected for further validation by real time RT - qPCR and functional analysis . It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor , MG - 132 , decreased WNV titers , indicating importance of this pathway during infection process . In infection models , the Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A / B ( cullin RING ubiquitin ligase ) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo , especially in midguts of mosquitoes . Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that Culex Cul4 acts as a pro - viral protein by degradation of CxSTAT via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway . We also show that gene knockdown of Culex Cul4 leads to activation of the Jak - STAT pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva . Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by WNV to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
