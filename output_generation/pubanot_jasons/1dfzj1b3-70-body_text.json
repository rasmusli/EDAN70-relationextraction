There are several ways to ascertain the ability to form hydroxyl radicals . One of them is the deoxyribose test . This method includes a mixture of ferric chloride ( FeCl 3 ) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , which in the presence of ascorbic acid forms Fe 2 + - EDTA , and oxidized form of ascorbic acid . After addition of hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , Fe 3 + - EDTA and HO \u2022 are formed . This is the so - called Fenton reaction , which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical ( Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2 \u2192 Fe 3 + + HO \u2212 + HO \u2022 ) . Hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments . Some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH , originating a pink pigment that can be quantified by spectrophotometry [ 5 ] . There are other methods that did not use deoxyribose but other components such as benzoic acid or safranine . Using these methods several authors have evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of essential oils [ 51 , 53 , 54 , 57 , 83 , 84 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 17}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 37}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 182}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 224}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 281}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 290}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 329}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 336}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 379}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 388}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 436}, "obj": "ne"}]}
