Although previously other authors have had similar results , isolated strains of H . influenzae were never further characterised [ 9 , 10 , 20 , 23 ] . To our knowledge this is the first report that associates bronchial infection with nontypeable H . influenzae ( NTHi ) in young persistant wheezers . Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that persistent wheezers present an underlying inflammation induced by chronic bacterial infection . Ch NTHI infection , resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses , has previously been reported by others [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . Moreover , in the lower airways of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease , NTHI has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [ 31 , 34 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
