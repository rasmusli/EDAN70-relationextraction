The results show that the ZIKV - prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine - specific T cells expressing TNF - \u03b1 ( tumour necrosis factor - \u03b1 ) and IFN - \u03b3 . Importantly , ZIKV - prME vaccination exhibited a strong ability to expand T cell functionality ( Figure 2d ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 62}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 233}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 403}, "obj": "ne"}]}
