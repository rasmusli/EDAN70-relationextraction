These experiments proved that ORF2 specifically interacts with the F - box protein \u03b2TRCP . Direct interaction between ORF2 and \u03b2TRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pulldown assay . Full - length ORF2 as well as KDEL ORF2 ( ORF2 protein containing \" KDEL \" amino acids at its C - terminal end , which allows it to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of getting transported through the golgi ) and \u0394 ORF2 mutant were able to pull - down \u03b2TRCP ( Figure 4C , lane 3 , 4 , 5 ) . As negative controls , ORF2 transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre - immune serum ( Figure 4C , lane 6 ) or mock translated lysate was incubated with ORF2 protein bound to beads ( Figure 4C , lane 2 ) or , the ORF3 protein was incubated with \u03b2TRCP protein ( Figure 4C , lane 7 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 362}, "obj": "ne"}]}
