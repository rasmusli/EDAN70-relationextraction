Using HIVIG or the anti - gp41 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 2F5 , we found that transcytosis occurred with virus inocula as low as 2 pg of p24 ( about 60 , 000 RNA copies ) with HIVIG and 0 . 02 pg of p24 ( about 500 RNA copies ) with 2F5 , amounts too small to be detectable in subnat fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV - 1specific antibody ( Table 1 ) . These quantities of virus are within the range observed in seminal and cervicovaginal fluids of HIVinfected individuals [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
