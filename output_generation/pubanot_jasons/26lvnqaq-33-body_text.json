The virus histochemistry ( VHC ) technique was performed on the infundibulum , magnum , isthmus and uterus according to the protocol developed by van Riel et al . [ 32 ] . Briefly , 3 - \u00b5m sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with graded alcohols . Incubation with the labelled virus was carried out overnight , at 4 \u00b0 C with either 5 , 50 or 100 hemagglutinin units ( HAU ) . To visualize the bound virus , slides were incubated with a monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase targeting the FITC molecule labelling the virus . The signal was amplified with a tyramide signal amplification system ( Perkin Elmer , MA , USA ) . Peroxidase was revealed with 3 - amino - 9 - ethyl - carbazole ( AEC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and embedded in glycerol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 379}, "obj": "ne"}]}
