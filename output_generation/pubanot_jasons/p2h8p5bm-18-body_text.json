This defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes and the acidity of the stomach . They serve as an initial barrier that protects the host from infection . Once these barriers have been breached , the innate immune response relies on a set of germline - encoded receptors , known as pathogen recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , which recognize pathogen specific molecular patterns that are sensed as a danger signal by the host cell [ 95 , 96 ] . Engagement of PRRs results in the activation of several defense mechanisms including , production of interferon ( IFN ) , induction of phagocytosis , cytokines , chemokines , antimicrobial peptides , antiviral proteins , as well as activation of leukocytes and T - cells . Furthermore , the innate immune response harbors cellular components , such as dendritic cells , macrophages , and natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 97 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
