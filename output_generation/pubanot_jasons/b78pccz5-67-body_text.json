The radon estimate assumes efficient application and control of radon safe construction in radon - prone areas combined with control of second hand smoke exposures known to act synergistically with radon . Efficient second hand smoke reductions have already been demonstrated in Finland in both workplaces and in homes resulting a decrease in proportion of adolescents exposed to SHS from 17 % in 1991 to 6 % in 2009 [ 25 ] and the SHS policies are moving forward also on at European level . The carbon monoxide controls were aimed to be implemented by compulsory alarms that will allow for identification of malfunctioning devices before the risks occur .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 172}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 199}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 306}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 614}, "obj": "ne"}]}
