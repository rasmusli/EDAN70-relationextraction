Recently , the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi - directional protein transduction system where the antiviral protein of interest , p27SJ , was expressed with tat at its C - terminal . Secreted into the cell medium , the fusion protein efficiently entered HIV - infected cells through a tat - mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV - 1 transcription and replication ( Figure 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 251}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 390}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 518}, "obj": "ne"}]}
