However , Amezcua and collaborators [ 1 ] reported an important proportion of farms with PWD occurrence using high levels of ZnO . Also , several studies reported an increased proportion of E . coli isolates resistant to tetracycline and sulfonamides in pigs fed with high zinc doses [ 113 , 114 ] . This may explain why antimicrobial resistance persists even in the absence of antimicrobial exposure [ 115 , 116 ] . Moreover , the use of high zinc levels in pig feeds has led to heavy metal contamination in the soil , raising environmental concerns [ 115 ] . Recently , Bouwhuis et al . [ 117 ] reported that organic zinc [ zinc methionine ( ZnM ) ] could be used as a substitute for the inorganic zinc ( ZnO ) in the pig diet . In fact , organic zinc can be supplemented in lower doses ( up to 500 mg / kg feed ) compared to ZnO [ 117 ] . In this study , the inclusion of ZnM resulted in improved faecal scores and the intestinal architecture compared to that observed in pigs supplemented with ZnO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 57}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 62}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 78}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 84}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 378}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 483}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 500}, "obj": "ne"}]}
