Hydrogen peroxide can then also be reduced by transition metal ions generating the hydroxyl radical ( HO \u2022 ) , one of the strongest oxidizing agents that can rapidly react with polyunsaturated fatty acids , resulting the production of peroxyl radicals ( ROO \u2022 ) . Peroxide hydrogen can also oxidise halide ions ( Cl - ) to hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , which is a strong oxidant that can react with amines producing chloramines , some of them being very toxic [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . These radicals are commonly known as ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) . Nevertheless and during an inflammatory process , there is also the generation of other free radicals named RNS ( reactive nitrogen species ) . Nitric oxide ( \u2022 NO ) and peroxynitrite anion ( ONOO - ) are two examples of this sort of radicals . Nitric oxide is produced in large quantities by the inducible nitric oxide synthases ( iNOS ) in activated macrophages and neutrophils during defence and immunological reactions . However this reactive species can also exerts its toxicity by generating the peroxynitrite anion after reacting with the superoxide anion radical [ 22 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 50}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 54}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 108}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 138}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 325}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 363}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 393}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 438}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 461}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 468}, "obj": "ne"}]}
