The ultimate aim was to identify the differences in serum protein levels that were closely associated with the progression of hepatitis B and HBV - induced ACLF . The results of this study may provide crucial information regarding viral mechanisms and the pathogenic process .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
