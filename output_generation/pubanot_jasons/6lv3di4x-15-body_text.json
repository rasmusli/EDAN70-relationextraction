We therefore investigated the impact of these alarmins which could be potentially released by JEV - infected epithel cells . To this end , we tested the effects of human recombinant IL - 25 , IL - 33 , and TSLP on macrophage infectivity by JEV . These experiments showed Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals . Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P \u03fd 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama , respectively ) ; differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P \u0545 0 . 05 ; * * , P \u0545 0 . 002 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
