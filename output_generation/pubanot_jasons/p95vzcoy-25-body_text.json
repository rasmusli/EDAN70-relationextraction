Since our experimental data clearly show that DWV transmission to ants is feasible via food , we assume that either ( 1 ) DWV - contaminated food must have been given to the ant colonies in captivity prior to our experiments or alternatively , but not mutually exclusive , ( 2 ) the D . hydei flies used as control food were DWV positive , which we regard as unlikely , or ( 3 ) the control colonies had consumed DWV - infected food prior to field - sampling by the company . Given the latter case , this would support the view that DWV transmission to M . rubra also occurs in the field , which would be in line with other studies showing the presence of viruses , originally described from honeybees , in ants [ 29 , 37 ] . A closer look at the controls also reveals that the viruses are not equally distributed within these naturally infected colonies . It would be interesting to see if the uneven distribution is due to age - related division of labor and non - stochastic interaction patterns [ 73 ] , i . e . , foragers might have a higher exposure risk compared to in - house workers . Considering the low viral titers in the controls , it is possible that the viruses persist in M . rubra as a covert infection that might turn into an overt infection under suitable conditions , e . g . , parasite infections as in honeybees [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 44}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 176}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 242}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 318}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 521}, "obj": "ne"}]}
