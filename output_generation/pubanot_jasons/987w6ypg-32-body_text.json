At present , the mechanism through which IFITMs block endosomal fusion of incoming viruses remains controversial [ 25 , 26 ] and this mechanism could be molecularly distinct from the one at play here . Multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain the antiviral effect of IFITMs in target cells . IFITMs have been reported to increase the intracellular levels of cholester [ 25 ] and variations in cholesterol have been associated to defects in membrane fusion , viral production and are likely to play an important role in multiple physiological processes [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 221}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 459}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 543, "end": 553}, "obj": "ne"}]}
