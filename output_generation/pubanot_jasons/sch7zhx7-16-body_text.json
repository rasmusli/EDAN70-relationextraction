For all samples , cells were treated as described prior to being trypsinized and centrifuged . Pellets were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 200 \u00b5L 2 % perchloric acid . Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 \u2022 C . 200 \u00b5L of supernatant was combined with 200 \u00b5L 5 mg / mL dansyl chloride ( Sigma Aldrich ) in acetone and 100 \u00b5L saturated sodium bicarbonate . Samples were incubate in the dark overnight at room temperature . Excess dansyl chloride was cleared by incubating the reaction with 100 \u00b5L 150 mg / mL proline ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Dansylated polyamines were extracted with 50 \u00b5L toluene ( Sigma Aldrich ) and centrifuged . Five microliter of sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate ( silica gel matrix ; Sigma Aldrich ) and exposed to ascending chromatography with 1 : 1 cyclohexane : ethyl acetate . The plate was dried and visualized via exposure to UV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 265}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 389}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 418}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 458}, "obj": "ne"}]}
