These DUBs interact with the WDR48 homolog Duf1 . Consistent with other studies , Duf1 stimulates Ubp9 and Ubp13 catalytic activity and is required for the physiological function of these enzymes in vivo . Interestingly , the W domain of Duf1 can interact directly with ubiquitin ( Pashkova et al . , 2010 ) , hinting at another potential role for these WDR proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 176}, "obj": "ne"}]}
