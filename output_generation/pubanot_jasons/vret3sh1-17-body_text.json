This service is accessible for individual genome submission via a graphical web interface , and the next generation SEED servers provide new access for programmatic batch submission of genomes via the RAST submission and retrieval server . This server supports programmatic submission of genomes to the RAST Server , re of job status , and retrieval of the final set of annotations . These scripts and the underlying application programming interface ( API ) enable users to submit genomes to the RAST Server , test the status of submitted jobs , and retrieve the output ( i . e . , annotated genomes ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
