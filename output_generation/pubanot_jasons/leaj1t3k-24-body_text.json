Upon coupling to these carrier peptides , the PNA cargoes were rapidly taken up by different human cell types in culture . When added to culture medium , these anti - HIV - 1 PNA - CPP conjugates effectively inhibited HIV - 1 replication , tat - dependent trans - activation and viral production by infected cells ; no significant decrease was observed with the unconjugated PNA , emphasizing the great promise held by these conjugates as antiviral agents [ 91 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 110}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 313}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 442}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 448}, "obj": "ne"}]}
