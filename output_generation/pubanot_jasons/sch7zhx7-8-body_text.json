For DFMO treatments , cells were trypsinized and reseeded with fresh medium supplemented with 2 % serum . Following overnight attachment , cells were treated with 100 \u00b5M , 500 \u00b5M , 1 mM , or 2 mM DFMO . Cells were incubated with DFMO for 96 h to allow for depletion of polyamines in Vero cells . For DENSpm treatment , cells were treated with 100 nM , 1 \u00b5M , 10 \u00b5M , 100 \u00b5M , and 1 mM 16 h prior to infection . During infection , media was cleared and saved from the cells . The same medium containing DFMO and DENSpm was then used to replenish the cells following infection . Cells were incubated at the appropriate temperature for the duration of the infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 24}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 31}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 43}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 99}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 108}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 252}, "obj": "ne"}]}
