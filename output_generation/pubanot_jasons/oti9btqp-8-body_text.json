Induction of cellular immune responses in mice immunised with either plasmid was measured 1 week after the third vaccination through IFN - \u03b3 ELISpot analysis after stimulating splenocytes with the ZIKV - prME peptide pools . The results illustrate that the T - cell responses induced by the consensus ZIK - prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non - consensus Figure 2 . Characterisation of cellular immune responses in mice following vaccination with the ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine . ( a ) Timeline of vaccine immunisations and immune analysis used in the study . ( b ) ELISpot analysis measuring IFN - \u03b3 secretion in splenocytes in response to ZIKV - prME immunisation . C57BL / 6 mice ( n = 4 / group ) were immunised i . m . three times with 25 \u03bcg of either pVax1 or the ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine followed by electroporation . IFN - \u03b3 generation , as an indication of induction of cellular immune responses , was measured by an IFN - \u03b3 ELISpot assay . The splenocytes harvested 1 week after the third immunisation were incubated in the presence of one of the six peptide pools spanning the entire prM and Env proteins . Results are shown in stacked bar graphs . The data represent the average numbers of SFU ( spotforming units ) per million splenocytes with values representing the mean responses in each \u00b1 s . e . m . ( c ) Epitope composition of the ZIKV - prME - specific IFN - \u03b3 response as determined by stimulation with matrix peptide pools 1 week after the third immunisation . The values represent mean responses in each group \u00b1 s . e . m . The experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results . ( d ) Flow cytometric analysis of T - cell responses . Immunisation with ZIKV - prME induces higher number of IFN - \u03b3 and TNF - \u03b1 secreting cells when stimulated by ZIKV peptides . One week after the last immunisation with the ZIKV - prME vaccine , splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides ( 5 \u03bcM ) or R10 only . Frequencies of ZIKV peptide - specific IFN - \u03b3 and TNF - \u03b1 secreting cells were measured by flow cytometry . Single function gates were set based on negative control ( unstimulated ) samples and were placed consistently across samples . The percentage of the total CD8 + T - cell responses are shown . These data are representative of two independent immunisation experiments .
