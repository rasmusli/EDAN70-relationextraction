This method was followed by [ 43 ] that demonstrated the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus possessed the strongest activity , even comparable to that of \u03b1 - tocopherol . However , in the same work the authors also reported that at higher concentrations of thyme oil , such capacity decreased . Basil oil , that was considered a good antioxidant when the activity was measured through the conjugated diene assay , did not stand out in this test , in which was only considered as possessing moderate activity . Such results may reveal that basil is only able to prevent the primary oxidation of lipids .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 90}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 139}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 161}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 186}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 371}, "obj": "ne"}]}
