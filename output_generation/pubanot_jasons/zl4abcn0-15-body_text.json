The powdered plants were then extracted by sonication for 10 min at room temperature of 25 \u00b1 2 \u2218 C using methanol as the solvent ( plant materials - solvent ratio of 1 : 5 to 1 : 10 ) . After filtration , the filtrates were dried using a rotary evaporator ( Buchi , Switzerland ) at 40 \u2218 C to obtain the respective extracts . The extracts were then kept in freezer at \u2212 20 \u2218 C prior to analysis . Meanwhile , for in vitro plants , dried callus was then powdered using a mortar and pestle and extracted by sonication method as described above .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 247}, "obj": "ne"}]}
