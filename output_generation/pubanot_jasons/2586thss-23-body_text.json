In the double antigen sandwich immunoassay , the HCV antigen labelled with colloidal gold is a soluble recombinant antigen . During the test , HCV antibodies in the sample react with antigen coated on the nitrocellucose membrane and gold - HCV antigen conjugates , forming a gold - conjugated Ag - Ab - Ag sandwich complex . At the same time , we carried out a series of experiments to optimize different parameters , such as the amount of immunoreagents , the type of materials , and the composition of the blocking solution and detector reagent mixture . The experimental results demon - strated that the chromatographic strip device we constructed is simple , sensitive and specific . It is an ideal test for the screening of patients with HCV infection . The presence of recombinant core and NS3 antigens in the strip may be crucial for the detection of HCV - infected patients with low antibody titers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 92}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 205}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 335}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 353}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 395}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 411}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 416}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 421}, "obj": "ne"}]}
