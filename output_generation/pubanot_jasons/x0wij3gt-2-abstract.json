We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2 / EP4 - mediated kinase signaling pathways . However , the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown . We evaluated the effects of c - Jun and 3 - phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1 ) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 60}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 68}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 235}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 300}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 386}, "obj": "ne"}]}
