However , more recent studies have shown that what occurs is mainly a fast electron transfer from the sample to DPPH radical . The abstraction of hydrogen from the sample by DPPH radical is marginal , because it occurs very slowly and depends on the hydrogen - bond accepting solvent . Methanol and ethanol , solvents generally used for antioxidant ability assays , are strongly hydrogen bond - accepting , therefore the hydrogen - abstracting reaction occurs very slowly [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 17}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 82}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 125}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 255}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 293}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 317}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 433}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 445}, "obj": "ne"}]}
