One dose of early N3 administration after CVA16 infection significantly prolonged survival but did not rescue the mice from developing neurological syndromes which eventually led to death ( Fig . S1 ) . This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross - neutralization of N3 against CVA16 ( Fig . S2 ) . Indeed , N3 was able to recognize C virions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA ( for na\u00efve protein interaction ; Fig . S3 ) and Western blot ( for denatured protein interaction ; Fig . S4 ) . In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains , N3 showed lower affinity to na\u00efve CVA16 ( Fig . S3 ) . Oppositely , anti - CVA16 antisera , obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16 , equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig . S4 . N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins of both B4 and C2 EV71 at approximately 35 kDa [ 17 , 21 ] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [ 22 ] that is different from anti - CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 71}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 179}, "obj": "ne"}]}
