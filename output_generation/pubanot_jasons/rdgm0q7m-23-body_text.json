A hallmark of RNA structure - dependent PRF signals is the necessity to maintain a precise spacing between slippery sequence and stimulatory RNA to position the ribosome appropriately at the slip - site ( 38 , 39 ) . The importance of spacing in PRRSV frameshifting was assessed in WG translations programmed with reporter mRNAs with spacer lengths of 4 - 13 nt ( Figure 6 ) . Efficient PRF was seen over a narrow range ( 9 - 11 nt ) , with shorter spacers leading preferentially to \u2212 2 PRF and longer spacers preferentially to \u2212 1 PRF . This pattern of frameshifting is highly reminiscent of that observed with stimulatory RNAs and suggests that the nsp1 \u2424 / PCBP complex functionally mimics such RNAs . The optimal spacer length was subtly different for the two PCBPs , with maximal PRF ( \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 ) seen at longer spacer lengths for added PCBP1 compared with PCBP2 . Thus the capacity of the various PCPBs to promote frameshifting into a particular reading frame is likely set by the position and / or conformation of the protein complex on the template , affected by subtle differences in the position of KH domains within the proteins which influences ' effective ' spacer length .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
