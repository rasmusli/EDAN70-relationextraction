Therefore the second scenario was determined as an attempt to control the burden of disease by filtration the exposures originating from outdoor air . Because both ultrafine and coarse particles and chemically reactive pollutants like ozone have lower infiltration factors than PM 2 . 5 , dominated by accumulation mode particles , the filtration was specified for PM 2 . 5 particles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 361}, "obj": "ne"}]}
