Here , lowfrequency stop codon readthrough at the end of the proangiogenic VEGFA coding sequence appends an additional 22 amino acids to the C - terminus , generating the VEGF - Ax isoform which possesses anti - angiogenic activity . The readthrough event is promoted by the binding of hnRNP A2 / B1 to a recognition element 10 nt downstream of the recoded VEGFA stop codon . Similar to PCBPs , hnRNP A2 / B1 is known to associate with nascent cellular RNAs and influence their localization , maturation and function ( 56 ) . How it acts to stimulate readthrough is unknown , but it is striking that both hnRNP A2 / B1 and the nsp1 \u2424 / PCBP complex promote their respective recoding events from a similar distance 3 of the ribosome , suggesting that they may contact the ribosome directly . How they subvert translation likely differs in each case as we were unable to uncover any stop codon readthrough activity of the nsp1 \u2424 / PCBP2 complex ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 61}, "obj": "ne"}]}
