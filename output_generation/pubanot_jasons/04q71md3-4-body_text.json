In the context of human infectious diseases , the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [ 2 ] . Air travel likely drives the global circulation of seasonal influenza A ( H3N2 ) viruses [ 3 ] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally - persistent strains between epidemic seasons . Retro modeling of the ' Hong Kong flu ' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [ 4 ] . Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on influenza virus spread , e . g . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 123}, "obj": "ne"}]}
