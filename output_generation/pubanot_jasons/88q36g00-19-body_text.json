Remarkably , the neuroprotective effect of H 2 appeared in the amygdala and cortex in this mouse model . The neuroprotection is thought to be due to the suppression of neuroinflammation , including excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes and the increased level of pro - inflammatory cytokines , as reported previously 12 . Although further investigation is required , our current and previous results point to the potential efficacy of maternal H 2 administration on the long - term neurological outcomes of offspring exposed to inflammation in utero .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 60}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 149}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 163}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 219}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 318}, "obj": "ne"}]}
