By investigating how CVB3 escaped DFMO - mediated polyamine depletion , we observed novel mutations in viral proteases that led us to investigate how polyamines contribute to viral protease activity . Thus , these escape mutants have highlighted a novel function of polyamines during viral infection . As described above , these results have implications for antiviral therapy , but they also inform our understanding of basic mechanisms in virology . Additional mechanisms whereby polyamines function in virus infection may be observed using similar means to highlight how these relatively simple molecules contribute to infection in diverse ways .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 188}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 209}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 310}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 426}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 642}, "obj": "ne"}]}
