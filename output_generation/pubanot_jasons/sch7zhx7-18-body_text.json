To ascertain how CVB3 evolves in response to repeated replication cycles in the absence of polyamine depletion , we passaged the virus in the presence of DFMO . We treated Vero - E6 cells with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left controls untreated ( NT ) , for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0 . 1 plaque forming units ( pfu ) / mL . After 24 h , we collected cellular supernatant and passaged 1 / 10th of the volume onto na\u00efve cells . Viral titers were determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five , the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO , from 10 \u00b5M to 5 mM , and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection . We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible , with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 \u00b5M and an IC50 value of 70 . 9 \u00b5M . In contrast , virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment , with an IC50 value of 293 \u00b5M , suggesting developing resistance to DFMO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 69}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 88}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 120}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 251}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 309}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 355}, "obj": "ne"}]}
