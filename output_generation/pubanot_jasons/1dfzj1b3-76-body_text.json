Nevertheless , under stress conditions , the dehydrogenase is converted to an oxidase enzyme and , under these conditions , the enzyme reduces oxygen instead of NAD + . On this way , there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide . Superoxide an can be generated by this system ( the hypoxanthine - xanthine oxidase ) or using a non - enzymatic reaction . In this case , superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen . In both cases , superoxide anion reduces nitro - blue tetrazolium ( NBT ) into formazan which is followed spectrophotometrically [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 9}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 105}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 111}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 161}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 177}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 190}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 335, "end": 342}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 422}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 450}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 466}, "obj": "ne"}]}
