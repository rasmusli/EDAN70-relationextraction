Hydrolysis probe sequences were designed concurrently with the primers using AlleleID \u00ae v . 7 ( Premier Biosoft , CA , USA ) and were trialled first in uniplex using Precision [UNK] Master Mix without SYBR \u00ae Green ( Primer Design , Southampton , UK ) . Optimal probe concentrations were determined as for primer concentration optimisation . The optimal amount of sample ( unknown quantity of target ) genomic DNA per reaction was defined as the largest amount of total DNA that showed a low C p across all assays but which avoided excessive dilution of samples ( thereby not affecting the analytical sensitivity of the assay ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 39}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 74}, "obj": "ne"}]}
