The exact mechanism of antiviral inhibition by IFITMs remains however unclear , given that a recent study indicated that IF inhibits the transition from hemifusion to pore formation rather than hemifusion itself , in a cholesterol - independent manner [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 234}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 399}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 474}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 544}, "obj": "ne"}]}
