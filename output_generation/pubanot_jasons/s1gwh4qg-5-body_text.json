{"cord_uid": "s1gwh4qg", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2739203", "divid": "5", "text": "Identifiers ( ID ) composed of alphanumeric and other symbols are commonly used for tagging protein and nucleotide sequences and associated annotation in Gen - Bank [ 1 ] , UniProt [ 2 ] , and other sources that either use these sequences or deal with molecular properties of associated biological entities ( Table 1 ) . For instance in Uni - Prot , the primary accession number is the sole UID . In GenBank three fields , locus , accession and version , carry four different IDs , but only gi number ( known also as primary ID ) and accession number combined with version form unique IDs ( UIDs ) . Each UID is assigned to a single entry . In contrast , a particular non - unique ID may be found in numerous entries . The UIDs ensure efficient computer - mediated data storage , maintenance and processing . To facilitate data mapping and transfer between different databases , in which ID inter - conversion plays important part , several specialized resources including GoMiner [ 3 ] , ErmineJ [ 4 ] , SOURCE [ 5 ] , RESOURCERER [ 6 ] ; IDconverter and IDClight [ 7 ] , and DAVID [ 8 ] have been developed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
