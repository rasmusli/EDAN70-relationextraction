These species are highly unstable , short - lived intermediates that stabilize themselves by abstracting hydrogen from another chemical species or rapidly react with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical ( propagation phase ) . In the propagation phase , peroxyl radicals formed can further oxidise the lipid , producing hydroperoxides .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 62}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 104}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 290}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 349}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 507}, "obj": "ne"}]}
