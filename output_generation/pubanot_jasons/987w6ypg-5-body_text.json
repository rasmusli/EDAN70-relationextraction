Of these , IFITM1 , \u2212 2 and \u2212 3 have emerged as broadacting restriction factors capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses , Coronaviruses , Influenza virus , Dengue virus and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . To stress the importance that IFITMs play in the control of viral infection , IFITM3 knockout mice display increased mortality and viral burden following influenza A virus challenge [ 8 , 13 ] and a specific polymorphism in the IFITM3 allele has been associated to increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in humans [ 13 , 14 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
