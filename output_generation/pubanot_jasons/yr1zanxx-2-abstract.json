Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation , but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms . We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS . Methods : The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection . Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus ( WNV ) , an emerging neuropathogen . The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs . Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric - based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells . Results : Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery . CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co - stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) by depleting CNS cellular sources , which limited local reactivation of CNS - infiltrating virus - specific T cells and reduced viral clearance .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
