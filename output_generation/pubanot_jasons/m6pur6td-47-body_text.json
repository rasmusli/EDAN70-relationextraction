The rapid increase in the average income of urban residents along with the high level of urbanization has made the affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) become the most dominant positive driving factor on the residential carbon emissions increment during the whole research period . The residential energy consumption structure was mainly based on gasoline , liquefied petroleum gas , and natural gas in Guangzhou . In order to further promote the negative effects of the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) , more clean fuels such as domestic solar systems should be added to the total residential energy consumption , and low carbon energy consumption behaviors and lifestyles should be advertised and practiced actively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 348}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 477}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 499}, "obj": "ne"}]}
