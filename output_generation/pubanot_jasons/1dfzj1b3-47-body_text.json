DPPH is commercialised in the radical form due to its stability . This radical shows a strong absorption maximum at 517 nm ( purple ) . In the presence of antioxidants , the colour turns from purple to yellow . Therefore the sole equipment needed for the assay is a UV - Vis spectrophotometer .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 28}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 72}, "obj": "ne"}]}
