Given this finding , we examined whether non - structural 3D protein of EV - D68 had the same ability to mediate cell cycle alteration . Transfection of 3D expression vector ( 2 \u00b5g ) induced G0 / G1 arrest , with an increase in the percentage of G0 / G1 cells from 39 . 37 \u00b1 0 . 52 % to 44 . 76 \u00b1 1 . 29 % ( 13 . 69 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ) and a corresponding increase in the G0 / G1 - G2 / M ratio from 2 . 02 \u00b1 0 . 04 to 2 . 62 \u00b1 0 . 18 ( 29 . 70 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , the extent of the increase in the percentage of G0 / G1 cells was dependent on the dose of 3D vector ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 \u00b5g ; R = 0 . 932 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and the G0 / G1 to G2 / M ratio also depended on the dose of 3D vector ( R = 0 . 827 ; P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 4B ) . These results suggest that the non - structural protein 3D of EV - D68 contributes to G0 / G1 arrest .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
