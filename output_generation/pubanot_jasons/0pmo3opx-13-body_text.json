{"cord_uid": "0pmo3opx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5431086", "divid": "13", "text": "To define the key prime - side interactions accounting for the inhibition of these HSPW - containing sequences , the peptide LHSPW was modeled into our pAPN crystal structure ( Fig . 4A ) . For modeling purposes , the P1 residue was selected as leucine since we had solved a crystal structure with that residue in the P1 position - we were unable to get a crystal structure of norleucine - and leucine was the second most favored P1 residue in our MSP - MS assay . The first three residues ( Leu1 - His2 - Ser3 ) were modeled from a poly - alanine structure and last two residues ( Pro4 - Trp5 ) were from the structure of pAPN complexed with substance P , which also contains a proline at the 4th position ( PDB ID : 4HOM ) . As predicted from the P1 structural data , the side chain of Leu1 in both peptides points into a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by APN residues M349 , Q208 , and F467 ( Fig . 4B ) . The side chain of His2 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of pAPN residue A346 . Pro4 forms a turn in the peptide , whereas the side chains of Ser3 and Trp5 both form VDW interactions with APN residue Y472 ( Fig . 4C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 131}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 253}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 388}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 402}, "obj": "ne"}]}
