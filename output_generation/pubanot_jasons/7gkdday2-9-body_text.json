The extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to single - plex reverse transcription qPCR ( RT - qPCR ) for detection of respiratory viruses including human rhinovirus ( HRV ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , influenza A and B , human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 ( HPIV1 , HPIV2 , HPIV ) , human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) , adenovirus , and human bocavirus ( HBoV ) . The RT - qPCR was done using AgPath - ID \u2122 One - Step RT - PCR Kit ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) and CFX96 Touch \u2122 Real - Time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad , CA , USA ) . The results of RT - qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at C t < 40 . 0 . Previously published primers and probes were used for viral pathogen detection by RT - qPCR [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
