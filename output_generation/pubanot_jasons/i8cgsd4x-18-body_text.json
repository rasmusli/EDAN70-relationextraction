C . Hsu cells were transfected with p6x2DRAF - Luc ( STAT reporter ) and pAct - Renilla ( control ) plasmids along with dsRNA against Culex Cul4 ( Cul4 dsRNA ) or GFP ( GFP dsRNA ) . Cells were treated with heat - inactivated E . coli , WNV or PBS for 1 h . Luciferase activity was measured 16 h post - stimulation . Fold increase over untreated control were plotted after normalising with Renilla transfection control . Error bars represent standard error from six separate samples ( Student ' s ttest * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between GFP - dsRNA and Cul4 - dsRNA cells for each stimulation ) . D . Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin ( CxCul4 ) . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as a silencing control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and treated with MG132 ( 1 \u03bcM ) or PYR - 41 ( 1 \u03bcM ) or treated with drugs alone . Total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 and WNV NS1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and Cul4 - overexpressing cells treated with or without inhibitors ) . E . Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( Cul4 dsRNA ) . No dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using CxVir1 ( Vir1 ) and CxVago ( Vago ) - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between No dsRNA , GFP dsRNA and Cul4 - knock - down cells ) . F . Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( Cul4 dsRNA ) or Culex STAT ( STAT dsRNA ) or both . GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control ( Control ) . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between Control and Cul4 dsRNA or STAT dsRNA cells ) . As a control , expression of CxCullin3 ( CPIJ011310 ) was measured after WNV infection or overexpression of WNV NS1 and NS5 . Results showed no significant change in expression level ( Fig 5B ) , indicating effect of WNV is specific to CxCul4 . Total RNA was collected at 24 hours post - transfection and real time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , significant from empty vector control ) . B . Real time Rt - qPCr was performed on cells treated as in A , using Culex Cullin3 - specific primers . C . Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( Cul4 dsRNA ) . GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control ( Control ) . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post - infection . Western blot was performed using anti - Culex STAT and anti - beta actin antibodies , with marker representing proteins with known molecular weight ( in kDa ) . The experiment was repeated 3 times and representative blots shown here . D . Hsu cells were transfected with WNV genes ( NS1 , NS5 or NS3 ) along with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( + ) . GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control ( - ) . Control indicates empty vector transfection . Cell lysates were collected 24 hours post - infection . Western blot was performed using anti - Culex STAT and antibeta actin antibodies . The experiment was repeated and representative blots shown here . E . Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin ( Cul4 dsRNA ) . GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control ( GFP dsRNA ) . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and treated with MG132 ( 1 \u03bcM ) and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post - infection . Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti - ubiquitin antibody , followed by Western blot using anti - ubiquitin ( Upper ) and anti - CxSTAT ( lower ) antibodies . WCL represents whole cells lysate ( pre - IP ) , FT represents flow - through and IP represents immunoprecipitate ( eluate ) . The experiment was repeated twice and representative blots shown here . F . Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against Culex Cullin ( Cul4 ) . GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control . At 24 h post - injection , mosquitoes were blood - fed with WNV for 1h . At 2 days and 10 days post - infection , mosquitoes were collected and processed for Western blot using anti - CxSTAT and anti - actin antibodies . The experiment was repeated and representative blots shown here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
