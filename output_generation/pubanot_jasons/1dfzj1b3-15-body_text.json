Another example of indirect method is based on the reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + , in the presence of 2 , 4 , 6 - trypyridyl - s - triazine . This method is known as FRAP ( ferric reducing antioxidant power ) . There are also methods based on the chemiluminescence of luminal in the presence of free radicals , which can be produced through AAPH [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 172}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 181}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 221}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 228}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 358}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 368}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 431}, "obj": "ne"}]}
