In brief , nucleic acids were extracted from 360 \u03bcl of NPA ( or plasmid RNA from positive control transcripts ) using a nucleic acids extraction kit ( Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit , F . Hoffman - La Roche Ltd , Basel , Switzerland ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control ( virus transport medium ) , starting at nucleic acid isolation . Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 \u03bcl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors . cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers , murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( ABI , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) , RNase inhibitor ( ABI ) and 3 \u03bcl of extracted viral RNA . Amplification reactions were performed using GeneAmp \u00ae PCR System 2700 ( ABI ) . Ten \u03bcl of newly synthesized cDNA was added to a mix consisting of 2 . 5 U of AmpliTaq \u00ae Gold DNA polymerase ( ABI ) and a Super - Mix containing seven pairs of forward and backward primers flanking unique sequences of the seven viruses ( the hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1 , 2 and 3 , the matrix protein gene of InfA , the NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB , the NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV ) . After initially holding the PCR mixture at 95 \u00b0 C for 10 min , amplification was performed as follows : two cycles at 95 \u00b0 C for 1 min , 55 \u00b0 C for 30 sec and 72 \u00b0 C for 45 sec , and then 38 cycles at 94 \u00b0 C for 1 min , 60 \u00b0 C for 30 sec , 72 \u00b0 C for 30 sec , followed by an additional 7 min at 72 \u00b0 C and immediate cooling to 4 \u00b0 C . After amplification , the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN Inc , Valencia , CA , USA ) and analyzed by enzyme hybridization assay [ 15 ] , measuring the optical density at 450 nm ( OD 450 ) using a micro - plate reader ( Stat Fax \u00ae 2100 , Awareness Technology Inc , Palm City , FL , USA ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
