Here , we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting bacterial sialidase . These compounds show striking competitive inhibitory effects against sialidase from C . per ( Cp - NanI ) . Importantly , C . perfringens is a human pathogen causing various gastrointestinal diseases such as enterotoxaemia , gas gangrene and peritonitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 70}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 81}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 109}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 136}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 307, "end": 330}, "obj": "ne"}]}
