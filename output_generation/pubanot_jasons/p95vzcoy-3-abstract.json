This virus is a positive sense single - stranded RNA virus and a harmful honeybee pathogen [ 22 ] , of which at least three distinct genotypes or master variants - type A , B , and C - are known [ 21 ] . DWV can cause clinical symptoms such as crippled wings , a shortened abdomen , and a reduced host life [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] . Driven by efficient vector transmission via ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor , DWV has become ubiquitous [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
