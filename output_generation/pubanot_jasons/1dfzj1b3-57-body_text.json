Ennajar et al . ( 2010 ) [ 75 ] studied the influence of organ , season and drying method on chemical composition and the ABTS - scavenging ability of Juniperus phoeniceae L . . They found the highest and the lowest activities in the same part of the plant ( berries ) . Considering the drying method used , oven - drying was the best method to obtain an important activity for leaf and berry oils , followed by sun - dried essential oils and shade - dried samples . Such variability seemed to be related to the chemical composition of the oils , wich having a similar profile , the main components were present in different proportions ( \u03b1 - pinene , \u03b4 - 3 - carene , \u03b1 - terpineol , \u03b2 - myrcene , among other components ) . Rosa canina L . also possessed capacity for scavenging ABTS , nevertheless the harvesting place was determinant in such activity , which seemed to be related to the presence of high percentages of vitispirane [ 76 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 25}, "obj": "ne"}]}
