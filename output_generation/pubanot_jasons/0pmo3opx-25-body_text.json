The structure of the unliganded pAPN was used to determine the structures of amino acid - soaked pAPN . Objective Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of amino acids and showed strong electron density for each of the amino acids ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . Based on these maps , the models of amino acids were built , and the models of pAPN / amino acid complexes were further refined . Crystallographic statistics can be found in Su Figure 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 20}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 42}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 91}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 104}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 153}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 204}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 218}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 294}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 357}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 433}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 469}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 482}, "obj": "ne"}]}
