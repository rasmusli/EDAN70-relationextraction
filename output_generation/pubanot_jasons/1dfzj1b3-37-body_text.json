They also found that the activity was dosedependent . The differences of activity of both samples was not significant , although the differences in the chemical composition of the oils were . Capparis spinosa oil was predominantly constituted by methyl isothiocyanate , whereas sabinene and limonene were the main components of Crithmum maritimum oil [ 55 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 318}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 345}, "obj": "ne"}]}
