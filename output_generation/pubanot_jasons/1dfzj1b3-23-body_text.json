Peroxidation level evaluation using the ferric thiocyanate During linoleic acid oxidation , peroxides are formed ( primary products of oxidation ) , which oxidise Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + . The latter ions form a complex with thiocyanate , and this complex has a maximum absorbance at 500 nm . Therefore , high absorbance indicates high linoleic - acid oxidation . Using this method , some authors [ 42 ] found that Lavandula angustifolia Mill . oil from Australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied . Such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 71}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 92}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 114}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 178}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 188}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 242}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 357}, "obj": "ne"}]}
