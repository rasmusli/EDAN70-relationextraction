Mino et al . delivered artificial zinc - finger proteins ( AZPs ) into cultured cells by expressing AZPs in fusion with the 9R peptide . These AZP - 9R conjugates strongly inhibited HPV - 18 replication to 3 % at 250 nM while gene - delivered AZP only achieved 12 % inhibition . PTD4 conjugates were also tested but proved to be less effective than AZPs fused to 9R .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 39}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 315}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 415}, "obj": "ne"}]}
