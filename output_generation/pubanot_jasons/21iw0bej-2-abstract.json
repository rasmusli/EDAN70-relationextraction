Little is known about the relationship between EV - D68 virus and host cells . In this study , we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV - D68 viral production , as well as the ability of EV - D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression . The results suggest that synchronization in G0 / G1 phase , but not S phase , promotes viral production , while sync in G2 / M inhibits viral production . Both an early EV - D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV - D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0 / G1 phase , thus providing favorable conditions for virus production . Cell cycle regulation by EV - D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins and CDKs , which were observed at the level of the protein and / or mRNA . Furthermore , the viral non - structural protein 3D of EV - D68 prevents progression from G0 / G1 to S . Interestingly , another member of the Picornaviridae family , EV - A71 , differs from EV - D68 in that G0 / G1 synchronization inhibits , rather than promotes , EV - A71 viral replication . However , these viruses are similar in that G2 / M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses , which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus . These results further clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of EV - D68 - related disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
