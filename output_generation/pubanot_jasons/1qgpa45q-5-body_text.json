HMPV causes respiratory disease similar to RSV , ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [ 2 ] . HMPV infections are seasonal and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens is common [ 1 ] . The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb and comprises eight open reading frames ( ORFs ) encoding nucleoprote ( N ) , phosphoprotein ( P ) , matrix protein ( M ) , fusion glycoprotein ( F ) , transcription enhancer protein ( M2 ) , small hydrophobic protein ( SH ) , attachment glycoprotein ( G ) , and large polymerase protein ( L ) [ 3 ] . The membrane glycoproteins F and G sequences are used to define two major genotypes or groups , A and B , which are further classified into four subgroups ( A1 , A2 , B1 , and B2 ) . HMPV A2 , the most frequently observed subgroup , is further divided into two proposed sub - lineages ( A2a and A2b ) [ 3 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
