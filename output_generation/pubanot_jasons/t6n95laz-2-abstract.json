Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ . The study population included healthy controls ( n = 5 ) , patients with CHB ( n = 5 ) and patients with HBV - induced ACLF ( n = 5 ) . Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls , patients with CHB and patients with HBV - induced ACLF ( n = 3 , respectively ) . Using iTRAQ analysis , 16 different serum proteins with \u2265 1 . 5 - fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls . Five of those proteins , C - reactive protein precursor , hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin , which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases , were subsequently verified using western blotting . The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ . Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process , and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV - induced ACLF remain unclear . This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist . The analysis of a larger number of samples is required to identify potential protein biomarkers that may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatitis B .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
