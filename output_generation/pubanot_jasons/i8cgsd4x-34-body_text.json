After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulos membranes , proteins were blotted using anti - Culex STAT ( rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC ) , anti - WNV NS1 , anti - WNV NS5 [ 58 ] or anti - V5 ( Invitrogen ) antibody followed by anti - rabbit or anti - mouse secondary antibodies . After adding substrate , the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels . Anti - \u03b2 - actin antibody ( Abcam ) was used in immunoblots as a loading control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 25}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 56}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 70}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 84}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 324}, "obj": "ne"}]}
