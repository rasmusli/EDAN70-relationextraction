{"cord_uid": "zl4abcn0", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4033353", "divid": "29", "text": "Statistical analyses were conducted for the lycorine content in callus ( initiated via 4 . 5 M 2 , 4 - D alone , 9 . 00 M 2 , 4 - D with combination of 4 . 5 M BAP ) and H . littoralis wild plant part extracts . The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4 . 5 M 2 , 4 - D alone and 9 . 00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4 . 5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0 . 05 ) . This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant . Thus , for the upcoming study , this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H . littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites . Hence , the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H . littoralis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 53}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 105}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 132}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 164}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 250}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 302}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 331}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 348}, "obj": "ne"}]}
