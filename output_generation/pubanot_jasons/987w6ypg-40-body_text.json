Fractions collected from the top of the gradient were then precipitated with a final concentration of 10 % TCA and analyzed by WB . The intensity of the retrieved bands was quantified by densitometry . The amount of CA and IFITMs present in the different fractions was then normalized to the total amount of CA and IFITMs present in all fractions ( set to 100 % ) . Prior to precipitation the density of each fraction was measured using a bench densitometer .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 139}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 443}, "obj": "ne"}]}
