The hydroperoxides formed from methyl linoleate by oxidation at 40 \u00baC was measured by [ 43 ] over time , spectrophotometrically , at a wavelength of 234 nm ( for conjugated diene absorption ) . The oils of Thymus vulgaris L . ( thyme ) , [ Eugenia caryophyllus ( C . Spreng ) Bull et Hare ] ( clove ) , and Ocimum basilicum L . ( basil ) had appreciable antioxidant activities , comparable to that of \u03b1 - tocopherol , the reference chosen by the authors [ 43 ] . In the thyme oil p - cymene and thymol predominated ; in the clove oil , eugenol and \u03b2 - caryophyllene dominated ; and in basil oil , linalool , isoanethole and eugenol constituted the major components . All of these components present in different relative percentages in the oils had similar ability for preventing lipidic peroxidation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 166}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 195}, "obj": "ne"}]}
