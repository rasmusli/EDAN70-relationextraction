To examine the effects of eEF1A on the NS5A - mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity , the luciferase reporter assay was used in this study . The results showed that eEF1A ( Figure 5A ) , as well as NS5A ( Figure 5B ) , inhibited the CSFV IRES activity in a dose - dependent manner . To further investigate the inhibitory effects of eEF1A and NS5A coexpression , eEF1A - and NS5A - expressing plasmids were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids into HEK293T cells . The results indicated that the eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A when NS5A and eEF1A were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ) . HEK293T cells were transfected with pMyc - eEF1A , pMyc - NS5A or pCMV - Myc . The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or PRRSV 3\u02b9 - UTR , followed by incubation with streptavidin beads . Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti - Myc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( 1 : 1000 ) ; ( B ) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose - dependent manner . HEK293T cells grown in the 6 - well plate were transfected with an increased amount of pMyc - eEF1A ( 0 , 1 , 2 and 4 \u03bcg ) , followed by streptavidin pulldown assay as described above ; ( C ) Competitive RNA pulldown assay . HEK293T cells grown in the 6 - well plate were transfected with the indicated pMyc - eEF1A ( 4 \u03bcg ) . The cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of the IRES RNA ( 0 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 5 and 3 . 0 \u03bcg ) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0 C and incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA and streptavidin beads . Bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti - Myc MAb . or pMyc - NS5A . The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) 3 1 - UTR , followed by incubation with streptavidin beads . The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti - Myc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( 1 : 1000 ) ; ( B ) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose - dependent manner . HEK293T cells grown in the 6 - well plate were transfected with an increased amount of pMyc - eEF1A ( 0 , 1 , 2 and 4 \u00b5g ) , followed by streptavidin pulldown assay as described above ; ( C ) Competitive RNA pulldown assay . HEK293T cells grown in the 6 - well plate were transfected with the indicated pMyc - eEF1A ( 4 \u00b5g ) . The cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of the IRES RNA ( 0 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 5 and 3 . 0 \u00b5g ) for 1 h at 4 \u02dd C and incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA and streptavidin beads .
