The expression of the IFN\u03bb - receptors and IFN\u03b3 are restricted , but the type I IFNs can be expressed by most cell types and their receptor , the interferon - \u03b1 / \u03b2 receptor ( IFNAR ) is expressed on all nucleated cells [ 107 ] . There are 17 different type I IFNs in humans ; these cytokines are produced by cells upon recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns , which are foreign to the host cell [ 95 , 108 ] , and mediates antiviral activity by autocrine and paracrine signaling through IFNAR [ 109 , 110 ] . Signaling through IFNAR induces an antiviral state by the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes ( ISGs ) [ 111 , 112 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
