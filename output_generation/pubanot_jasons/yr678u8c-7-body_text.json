In the first , ATG12 becomes conjugated to ATG5 in a process requiring the E1 - like enzyme ATG7 and the E2 - like enzyme ATG10 . ATG12 - ATG5 then binds to ATG16L and forms a large complex known as the ATG16L complex . This complex localises to the phagophore and can determine the site of conju of the second Ubl system . In this second system , microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 ( LC3 ) is initially cleaved by ATG4 near the C - terminus at position G120 to generate cytoplasmic LC3 - I . This subsequently becomes lipidated with phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) in a process requiring ATG7 and another E2 - like enzyme ATG3 to generate membrane tethered LC3 - II [ 19 ] . LC3 - II is inserted into both the inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome , and as such , remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway [ 20 , 21 ] . As a result , LC3 has become an extremely valuable marker protein for studying autophagy . Figure 2 . Schematic of mammalian autophagy pathway . MTOR is the major control complex for autophagy . MTOR senses levels of amino acids , glucose and growth factors , as well as genotoxic and ER stress . Upon stimulatory signals , MTOR becomes inactivated and the ULK complex becomes hypophosphorylated and relocalises to the phagophore , along with PIP3 , produced by class III PI3K complexes . The Atg16L complex and LC3II are also recruited to the growing autophagosome , allowing expansion of the membrane and fusion to give a complete autophagosome , engulfing organelles , aggregated proteins and intracellular pathogens . The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome , resulting in the degradation of the contents and recycling of nutrients into the cytoplasm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
