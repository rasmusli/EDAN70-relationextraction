The cells were collected at 48 hpt , washed two times with cold PBS , and lyzed with the CHAPS lysis buffer ( 1 % CHAPS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] ) containing 1 mM PMSF ( catalog no . ST506 ; Beyotime ) and 1 mg / mL protease inhibitor cocktail at 4 \u02dd C for 1 h . The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13 , 000\u02c6g for 20 min at 4 \u02dd C . The clarified lysate was treated with a mixture of RNase A ( 25 U / mL ) ( catalog no . 2158 ; TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) and RNase T1 ( 1 U / \u00b5L ) ( catalog no . PF0059 ; Fermentas , Burlington , Canada ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to Co - IP analysis . The lysate was precleared with the Protein G - Agarose ( catalog no . 11243233001 ; Roche ) at 4 \u02dd C for 4 h followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4 \u02dd C for 4 h , and the Protein G - Agarose was then added and incubated at 4 \u02dd C for 2 h . The Protein G - Agarose was washed three times with PBS , and the bound proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 233}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 247}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 261}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 282}, "obj": "ne"}]}
