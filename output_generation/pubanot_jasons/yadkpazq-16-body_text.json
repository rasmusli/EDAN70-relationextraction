M . Hosie and O . Jarret , University of Glasgow , Great Britain ) was titrated on FEA cells , and the lowest stock dilution leading to productive infection of the cells after 48 h was used for inhibition assays . Experiments were carried out in 96 - well plates and cells were treated with 100 \u03bcL of supernatants or relevant controls immediately prior to inoculation . Every second day thereafter , 50 \u03bcL culture medium was replaced by the same volume of fresh supernatant . At appropriate time points , cells and supernatants were harvested and total nucleic acid was extracted from both the cells and supernatants using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Viral replication in supernatants and proviral loads in cells were measured by real - time RT - PCR and real - time PCR respectively , with assays previously described [ 63 ] . The time course experiments were conducted with supernatants derived from PBMCs of three cats and the measurements on day 8 post inoculation were carried out with material derived from two additional cats . In order to facilitate interpretation of the figures illustrating measurements of viral RNA loads , 45 cycles - cycle threshold ( Ct ) values were calculated and means of duplicate wells are depicted .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
