Twenty - four hours after transfection with HIV - 1 coding DNAs , cells were washed and then treated with 1000U / mL of IFN\u03b1 for further 48 hours , prior to virion particle purification . Virion particles were then either analyzed by WB or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells upon exo - RT purification to determine their infectivity by flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards . When HIV - 1 virions were produced in HEK293T cells , no detectable amounts of IFITMs were found , irrespectively of IFN stimulation suggesting that IFITMs may have to reach a certain amount to be promptly incorporated into virions . In contrast , virion produced in HeLa cells incorporated readily detectable levels of IFITMs and this incorporation was increased upon IFN stimulation . When virion particles produced in these conditions were normalized and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells , a drastic decrease in infectivity was observed in virions produced in HeLa cells versus viruses produced in HEK293T cells and IFN stimulation did not grossly modify these differences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 175}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 316}, "obj": "ne"}]}
