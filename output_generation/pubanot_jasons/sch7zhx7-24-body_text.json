Toward this end , we treated cells with a different polyamine - depleting agent , diethylnorspermidine ( DENSpm ) , which acts to accelerate polyamine catabolism by acetylating spermidine and spermine . Vero cells were treated with 100 \u00b5M DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection at MOI 0 . 1 with wildtype and mutant CVB3 . At 48 hpi , we measured viral titers , and again we observed significant sensitivity with the wildtype virus ( Figure 2D ) . However , we observed partial resistance in our protease mutant viruses . As with DFMO , when we calculated the percent replication in DENSpm - treated cells compared to untreated cells , the protease mutants exhibited resistance that was additive ( Figure 2E ) . We verified that both of these molecules were depleting polyamines in our treated cells by directly visualizing polyamines via thin - layer chromatography ( Figure 2F ) .
