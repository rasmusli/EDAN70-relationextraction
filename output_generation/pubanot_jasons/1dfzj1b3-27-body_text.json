Leaf and flower oils had the best antixidant activities , nevertheless inferior to those of BHT and B . The authors [ 46 ] attributed such weak activities to the low level of phenolic compounds ( eugenol in the flowers ) or even their absence ( stem and leaf ) , because the extracts also studied in the present work presented higher activities . Nevertheless it is worthy to refer the similar activities found in leaf and flower oils , in spite of the absence or phenols in leaf oils .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 137}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 157}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 198}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 211}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 232}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 245}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 385}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 397}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 495}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 501}, "obj": "ne"}]}
