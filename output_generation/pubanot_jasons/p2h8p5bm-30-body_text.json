The rodent specific TRIM79\u03b1 was identified to interact with LGTV NS5 in a yeast two - hybrid screen . TRIM79\u03b1 expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of NS5 . Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to tick - borne flaviviruses as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by TRIM79\u03b1 nor did TRIM79\u03b1 interact with NS5 of WNV [ 147 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 469}, "obj": "ne"}]}
