Briefly , the cells were grown to 50 % confluence in a 35 mm dish and transfected with 1 \u03bcg of ZIKV - prME vaccine . The cells were collected 2 days after transfection , washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) . Western Blot was used to verify the expression of the ZIKV - prME protein from the harvested cell lysate and the immune specificity of the mouse and RM serum through the use of either pan - flavivirus antibody or immune sera from the ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice , as described previously . 25 In brief , 3 - 12 % Bis - Tris NuPAGE gels ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) were loaded with 5 \u03bcg or 1 \u03bcg of ZIKV Env recombinant protein ( rZIKV - E ) ; transfected cell lysates or supernatant and the Odyssey protein Molecular Weight Marker ( Product # 928 - 40000 ) . The gels were run at 200 V for 50 min in MOPS buffer . The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device ( Life Technologies ) . The membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE , USA ) for 1 h at room temperature . To detect vaccine expression , the anti - Flavivirus group antigen ( MAB10216 - Clone D1 - 4G2 - 4 - 15 ) antibody was diluted 1 : 500 and the immune serum from mice and RM was diluted 1 : 50 in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0 . 2 % Tween 20 ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 \u00b0 C . The membranes were washed with PBST and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody ( goat anti - mouse IRDye680CW ; LI - COR Biosciences ) for mouse serum and flavivirus antibody ; and goat anti - human IRDye800CW ( LI - COR Biosciences ) for RM sera at 1 : 15 , 000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature . After washing , the membranes were imaged on the Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR Biosciences ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
