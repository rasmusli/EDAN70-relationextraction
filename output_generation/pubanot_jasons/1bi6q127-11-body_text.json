{"cord_uid": "1bi6q127", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6410205", "divid": "11", "text": "Several species of bats control inflammation by having a mutation at a highly conserved serine residue in one of the key adaptor molecules for sensing damaged DNA , i . e . , stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) , which reduces its functionality . STING senses damaged DNA or dsDNA from viruses and induces an interferon response . The replacement of serine at position 358 by other amino acids makes bat STING less effective in activating interferons [ 30 ] . In addition to possessing a less effective STING , the pyrin and HIN domain ( PHY ) genes , which are involved in microbial DNA sensing and formation of inflammasome , are absent in bats [ 21 , 31 ] . These findings demonstrate some of the reasons for reduced inflammation in bats during viral infection . Mechanisms to modulate inflammation may have evolved to mitigate the detrimental effects of flight . Excessive exposure to cytosolic DNA in bat cells during flight might have posed a strong natural selection pressure to reduce the activation of bat DNA sensors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 95}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 362}, "obj": "ne"}]}
