Heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) are a group of proteins that respond to stress , including heat , hypoxia , irradiation , infection , or toxic agents 46 . HSP has been shown to influence apoptosis in tumour cells , regulate p53 function , and induce an immune response to tumours 47 . Increased HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis , but they also can increase immunity to cancer 48 . For example , over - expressed HSP60 protein is suggested to promote prostate cancer , colorectal cancer , and primary breast cancer ; for these cancers , HSP60 inhibitors may be used as anti - cancer agents [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] . Whereas , a loss of HSP60 immunopositivity is related to the development and progression of bronchial cancer in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 52 . In this experiment , we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and the HSP90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and 60 hpi . As the influence of the HSP expression changes due to different cancers , the anti - cancer significance of the differential expression of HSPs in CPV - infected cells is complicated and requires further study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
