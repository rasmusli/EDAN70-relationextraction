These observations , in addition to the modified histology activity index ( HAI ) scores , indicated that expression of HCV proteins caused chronic hepatitis in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice because a weak , though persistent , immune response followed an initial bout of acute hepatitis ( Figure S1 ) . Moreover , we observed a number of other pathological changes in these mice - including swelling of hepatocytes , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , abnormal accumulation of glycogen , steatosis , fibrosis , and HCC ( Figures 1E and F , Table S1 ) . Steatosis was mild in the younger mice ( day 21 ) and became increasingly severe over time ( days 120 and 180 ; Figure S2 ) . Importantly , none of the pathological changes were observed in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 1F ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
