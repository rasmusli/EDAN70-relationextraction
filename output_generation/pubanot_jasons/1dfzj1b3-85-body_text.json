More examples of 5 - lipoxygenase inhibitors included some Salvia essential oils from South Africa . The authors attributed such activities to the presence of 1 , 8 - cineole , \u03b1 - pinene and \u03b2caryophyllene in the essential oils [ 98 ] . The same major components present in the essential oils of four indigenous South African Helichrysum species were also reported to inhibit 5 - lipoxygenase [ 99 ] . Chamazulene and \u03b1 - bisabolol are examples of other components , present in the essential oil of chamomile , with anti - inflammatory activities partly due to the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis since they appear to be good 5 - lipoxygenase inhibitors [ 17 ] . The essential oils of leaves and rhizomes of Alpinia murdochii Ridl . , Alpinia scabra ( Blume ) N\u00e1ves and leaves of Alpinia pahangensis Ridl . also showed to be good 5 - lipoxynease inhibitors . \u03b2 - Pinene , \u03b1 - pinene and sabinene were the main components of the leaf oils , whilst the sesquiterpenes \u03b3 - selinene , \u03b1 - selinene and \u03b1 - panasinsen predominated in the rhizome oils [ 100 ] . The oils Torreya nucifera Siebold et Zucc . oil , mainly constituted by limonene , \u03b4 - 3 - carene and \u03b1pinene , was a COX - 2 selective inhibitor having significant inhibitory effects on PGE 2 production [ 101 ] . 1 , 8 - Cineole , a terpene oxide , present in many essential oils was shown to inhibit leukotrienes ( LTB 4 ) and prostaglandins ( PGE 2 ) , both pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism [ 102 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 196}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 209}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 228}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 436}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 454}, "obj": "ne"}]}
