The mixture of stereoisomers geranial ( E - isomer ) and neral ( Z - isomer ) , known as citral , constitutes the main components of Cymbopogon citratus ( DC ) Stapf . ( lemon ) essential oil . This essential oil revealed to be capable to suppress IL - 1\u03b2 and IL - 6 in LPS - stimulated peritoneal macrophages of normal mice [ 117 ] . The same authors attributed similar properties to the eugenol , the main component present in the essential oil of Syzygium aromaticum ( L . ) Merr . et Perry ( clove ) [ 118 ] . Other authors also found that eugenol on human macrophages ( U937 ) under the stimulation of LPS blocked the release of IL - 1\u03b2 , TNF - \u03b1 and PGE 2 [ 119 ] . Whether some essential oils are able to inhibit the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines such as TNF - \u03b1 , some of them , particularly lemongrass , geranium and spearmint and their main components ( citral , geraniol , citronellol , and carvone ) , can also suppress TNF - \u03b1 - induced neutrophil adherence responses [ 120 ] . According to these authors , those essential oils or their major components do not affect TNF - \u03b1 but do affect the neutrophil function to suppress their adhesion . Therefore and concerning lemongrass and citral and as reported above , they can also suppress IL - 1\u03b2 and IL - 6 pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 117 ] . In other work , Lin et al . ( 2008 ) [ 121 ] Therefore , the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be , at least in part , due to the inhibition of TNF - \u03b1 release from macrophages , according to the same authors [ 122 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 12}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 26}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 36}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 56}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 184}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 318}, "obj": "ne"}]}
