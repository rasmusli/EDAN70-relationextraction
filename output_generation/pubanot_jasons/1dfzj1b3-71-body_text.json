The activity of both oils were dose - dependent and they were mainly constituted by thymol , p - cymene and \u03b3 - terpinene [ 54 ] . Patil et al . ( 2010 ) [ 51 ] have compared two methods ( deoxyribose and benzoic acid ) on the hydroxyl radical scaven ability of Ageratum conyzoides , mainly constituted by the phenolic chromenes precocene I and precocene II , and they obtained different responses according to the method used . In the benzoic acid hydroxylation method , the essential oil presented better activity than in the deoxyribose method . The authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 144}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 324}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 326, "end": 337}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 355}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 434}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 451}, "obj": "ne"}]}
