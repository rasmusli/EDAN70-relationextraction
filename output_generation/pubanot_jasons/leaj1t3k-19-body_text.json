However , some studies reported toxicity in cell culture with increase of PPMO dose [ 66 ] or longer period of exposure [ 66 , 75 ] , and in vivo toxicity as the treatment dose increased , usually at doses higher than antiviral ones [ 67 ] . The peptide moiety of PPMOs seems to contribute to this toxicity . When Deas et al . tested both PMO and PPMO against WNV in mice , they found that mice could tolerate higher doses of PMO compared to PPMO ( 3 mg against 300 \u03bcg , respectively ) [ 67 ] . Mice treated with high doses of PPMO would suffer from weight loss and develop abnormal behavior and smaller livers . Besides dosedependent toxicity , the schedule of treatment regimen may also affect PPMO toxicity : while Burrer et al . did not document any treatment - associated toxicity when PPMOs were administered to healthy mice , they observed significant toxicity when PPMO treatment was given after MHV challenge [ 63 ] . Lupfer et a l . reported abnormal infiltration of mouse lungs by immune system cells when PPMO targeting FLUAV was administered at higher doses [ 83 ] . The authors hypothesized that the arginine - rich CPP mimics the eosinophil major basic protein , also rich in arginine residues , in triggering the migration of inflammatory cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 165}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 356}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 429}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 438}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 516}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 533}, "obj": "ne"}]}
