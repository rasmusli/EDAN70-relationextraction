Five - residue long peptides containing P1 - P4 \u2032 residues from primary cleavages in the library were synthesized and tested for their ability to prevent the cleavage of a fluorogenic alanine substrate by hAPN . From these initial peptides , only nHSPW was able to appreciably inhibit substrate cleavage with an IC 50 of 6 . 5 \u03bcM , whereas the remaining peptides all had IC 50 values above 500 \u03bcM ( Table 1 ) . Replacement of the P1 residue norleucine of nHSPW with either leucine or alanine did not have a significant impact on the IC 50 , resulting in low \u03bcM inhibitors . Complete removal of the P1 norleucine , resulting in the 4 - mer peptide HSPW , only decreased the potency of the inhibitor to 43 \u03bcM .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 456}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 474}, "obj": "ne"}]}
