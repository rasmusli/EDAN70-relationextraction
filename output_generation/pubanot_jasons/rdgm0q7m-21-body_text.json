To test the involvement of individual KH domains in PRF , amino acid substitutions ( to GDDG ) were introduced within the conserved , hallmark GxxG loop in each domain , which forms part of the RNA binding domain . These mutations have been shown previously to abolish RNA bind - ing activity of the individual domain without compromising its stability ( 37 ) . As shown in Figure 5A and B , mutation of the KH2 domain of PCBP1 or PCBP2 had little , if any , effect on frameshifting , whereas the KH3 domain mutation essentially abolished trans - activation . The KH1 domain mutation had a more varied phenotype . With PCBP1 , frameshift - stimulation was greatly reduced , but for PCBP2 , \u2212 2 PRF was diminished four - fold , but full activity in \u2212 1 PRF was retained . Further , whilst addition of PCBP1 KH1m or PCBP1 KH3m alone was unable to stimulate PRF , when ( A ) EMSA analysis of binding of nsp1 \u2424 , PCBP1 or PCBP2 ( alone or in combination ) to a short ( 58 nt ) 32 P - labelled in vitro transcript containing the PRRSV PRF signal . After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 10 min , reactions were loaded onto a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel and , following electrophoresis , the gel was fixed , dried and subjected to autoradiography . Numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of protein ( s ) with respect to the radiolabelled RNA ( 10 nM ) . In lanes BSB , DB and W , RNA was incubated alone with band - shift buffer , protein dilution buffer or water , respectively ( see ' Materials and Methods ' section ) . ( B ) The composition of RNA - protein complexes was investigated by supershift assay . Complexes were prepared with 10 nM RNA and a 50 - fold molar excess of nsp1 \u2424 ( N ) and PCBP2 ( P2 ) and subjected to EMSA directly ( N , P2 , NP2 ) , or after incubation with monoclonal ( mono ) or polyclonal ( poly ) antisera raised against PCBP2 ( \u2423 P2 , mono ) or nsp1 \u2424 ( \u2423 N , mono or poly ) . As controls , the radiolabelled RNA probe was incubated with either DB , the \u2423 P2 mono or the \u2423 N poly . added together , a partial restoration of both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF ( to about 20 % of the WT value ) was observed ( Figure 5C ) . Note that in all assays , frameshift - stimulation remained dependent upon addition of nsp1 \u2424 ( Figure 5D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
