This vector contains the GG GUU UUU shift site , 5 upstream nucleotides ( nt ) and 66 downstream nt ( 79 nt in total ) inserted between Renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes of plasmid pDluc ( 27 ) such that \u2212 2 PRF is required for firefly luciferase expression . Protein expression vectors were as follows . PCBPs were cloned into pQE ( Qiagen ) at the BamH1 / HindIII ( PCBP1 , 2 , 3 ) or Sph1 / HindIII ( PCBP4 ) sites . Human PCBP1 ( NM 006196 . 3 ) and PCBP2 ( NM 005016 . 5 ) in pQE30 were kindly provided by Professor B . Semler , University of California , Irvine . PCBP3 ( NM 021568 . 2 and XM 006513919 . 2 ) and PCPB4 ( NM 033008 . 2 or XM 006713271 . 1 ) were obtained by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) using purified mRNA from mouse BV2 and human HeLa cells , repectively . Human hnRNP K / J ( NM 002140 . 3 ; derived from HeLa cell mRNA by RT - PCR ) was cloned into BamH1 / XhoI - cut pET21a ( Novagen ) . Nsp1 \u2424 was cloned into BamH1 / HindIII - cut pQE30 and BamH1 / XhoI - cut pGEX6P2 ( GE Healthcare ) . For analysis of ribosomal pausing , a 39 - bp region of the PRRSV PRF region ( with defective slippery sequence GGUAUUC , flanked by wildtype ( WT ) sequences comprising 5 nt upstream and 27 nt downstream ) was cloned into the XhoI / PvuII sites of pPS0 ( 28 ) . Assessment of PRF efficiencies in cultured cells employed pL - nsp1 \u2424 - 2 , which encodes a self - cleaving nsp1 \u2424 - nsp2 polyprotein under the control of a T7 promoter ( 19 ) . Poliovirus P3 / Leon / 37 ( accession number K01392 . 1 ) IRES SLIV was prepared by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from plasmid pGemCat / PVIRES / Luc ( kind gift of Dr Graham Belsham ) and cloned into BamH1 / EcoR1 - cut pcDNA3 . 1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
