We noticed that administration of N3 reduced viral expression significantly in the brain , spinal cord , muscle , skin , and the intestine ( Fig . 6 ) . We also confirmed that CNS - and limb muscle - tropism of EV71 viremia occurred in this model [ 11 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 79}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 133}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 276}, "obj": "ne"}]}
