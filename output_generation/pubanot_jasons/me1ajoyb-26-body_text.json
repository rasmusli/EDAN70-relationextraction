The field of metabolomics is young but potentially informative for understanding hantavirus / reservoir host interactions . Many viruses metabolically remodel the host cell to optimize infection . Because metabolic products ( e . g . , carbohydrates , lipids , prostaglandins , etc . ) are identical or highly similar between vertebrate species , this approach may help identify which enzymes , by virtue of their metabolic products , may be targeted by hantaviruses . While there are no reports of metabolic assessment of hantavirus infections , Rift Valley Fever virus ( RVFV ) modulates the activity of adenosine 5 ' monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) in infected cells . This enzyme is a regulator of several metabolic pathways , including enhancement of catabolic pathways such as autophagy and ATP production , but it represses anabolic pathways , such as lipid biosynthesis . Infection of cells by several viruses , including RVFV , results in activation of AMPK and restriction of viral replication , suggesting an antiviral role for this enzyme [ 105 ] . Other studies have revealed metabolic pathway targeting by viruses [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] , thus efforts to examine how hantaviruses may manipulate the metabolomes of infected cells could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating hantavirus disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 429}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 455}, "obj": "ne"}]}
