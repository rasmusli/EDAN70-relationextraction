Using two tests based on the same principle but using diverse methodologies ( spectrophotometer and TLC ) , the authors were able to find the compounds responsible for such activities after separation by TLC . The authors identified 1 , 8 - cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxida activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L . . The same procedure was followed by other authors [ 64 ] for the oils of Aniba panurensis ( Meisn . ) Mez , Aniba rosaeodora Ducke and Licaria martiniana ( Mez ) Kostern . , from Brazil . The IC 50 values were generally > 1 , 000 \u03bcg / mL , substantially superior to that of quercetin , the reference used by the authors . Such low activity was attributed to the absence or to the very low concentrations of some compounds responsible for antioxidant activity - \u03b2 - caryophyllene along with phenolic compounds . Once again , and as reported above , such results might be enough for the authors to decide not to do other assays .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 9}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 100}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 496}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 515}, "obj": "ne"}]}
