The offspring were perfused via the heart with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS . The brains were then fixed in 4 % PFA for at least 24 h , embedded in paraffin , and cut in coronal planes ( approximately 2 . 0 mm posterior to bregma ) . Immunofluorescence staining was performed using the following primary antibodies : rabbit monoclonal anti - Olig2 anti ( ab109186 , 1 : 100 ; Abcam , Tokyo , Japan ) or rabbit polyclonal anti - GFAP antibody ( 23935 - 1 - AP , 1 : 100 ; Proteintech , Chicago , IL ) . The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0 C overnight and were further incubated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa fluor 488 , 1 : 500 or Alexa fluor 563 , 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) for 30 min at room temperature . Nissl staining was also performed in order to evaluate the number of neuronal cells . Following deparaffinization , the tissue sections were incubated in 0 . 2 % cresyl violet ( Muto Pure Chemicals Co . ) , and subsequently dehydrated in graded ethanol , and permanently mounted . Images were acquired with a BZ - 9000 microscope ( Keyence Corporation , Osaka , Japan ) . The BZ Image Measurement Software program ( Keyence ) was used to quantify the number of neuronal cells and Olig2 - positive cells , as well as the number and the soma size of the GFAP - positive cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 216}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 222}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 271}, "obj": "ne"}]}
