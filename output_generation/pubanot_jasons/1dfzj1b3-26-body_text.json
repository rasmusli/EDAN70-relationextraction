Sesquiterpenoids dominated the oils . Furanodiene and germacrene D predominated in the oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora , whereas furanodienone and curzerenone constituted the major components of the Lindera pulcherrima oil [ 44 ] . The oils of Persea gamblei were constituted by \u03b2 - caryophyllene , \u03b3 - gurjunene and \u03b2 - cubenene . Such activities were independent on the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils . Mighri et al . ( 2010 ) [ 45 ] studied the antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Artemisia herbaalba Asso . cultivated in Southern Tunisia . Diverse methods were used , and one of them was the \u03b2bleaching test . They found four oil types : \u03b2 - thujone , \u03b1 - thujone , thujones ( \u03b1 + \u03b2 ) , and 1 , 8cineole / camphor / thujones ( \u03b1 + \u03b2 ) . All of these oils exhibited weak antioxidant abilities for preventing the linoleic acid oxidation . The \u03b2 - thujone - rich oil showed the best inhibition percentage ( 12 . 5 % ) , nevertheless much lower than BHA ( 89 . 2 % ) . The attributed such results to the absence of nonphenolic compounds [ 45 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 91}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 234}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 263}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 296}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 313}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 365}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 389}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 405}, "obj": "ne"}]}
