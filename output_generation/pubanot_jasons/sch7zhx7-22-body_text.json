We infected these cells at MOI 0 . 1 and measured viral titers at 48 hpi . We again observed significant sensitivity by the wildtype virus with any concentration of DFMO ; in contrast , both protease mutants exhibited significant resistance , again suggesting that these mutations confer resistance to polyamine depletion . We then measured percent replication by dividing the titer in D treatment conditions ( 500 \u00b5M ) by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C ) . We observed that compared to wildtype virus , all mutants exhibited higher replication , and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance . Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication ; however , this difference was not statistically significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 112}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 346}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 488}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 564}, "obj": "ne"}]}
