By isolating DFMO escape mutants , we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection . Here , we have isolated two protease mutants following passage of CVB3 in DFMO . We previously characterized escape mutants for chikungunya virus and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [ 31 ] . In contrast , we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either pro . From our data , we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease activity against a specific target ; however , we observe that both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine - depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment . Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 127}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 205}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 314}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 535, "end": 540}, "obj": "ne"}]}
