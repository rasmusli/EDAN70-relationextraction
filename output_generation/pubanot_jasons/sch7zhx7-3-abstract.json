Polyamines function in nucleotide metabolism , cell cycling , and cell signaling , among several other functions [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . Several compounds have been developed that specifically target polyamine metabolism , either by reducing their synthesis or enhancing their breakdown , and these compounds have been tested clinically for the treatment of cancers and parasites [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) , which inhibits polyamine biosy , has received attention as an anti - trypanosomal molecule and is well - tolerated in patients [ 22 , 23 ] . Polyamines are also crucial for RNA virus infection , including CVB3 [ 24 ] . Polyamine depletion via DFMO restricts CVB3 infection , in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ] . We previously described how Chikungunya and Zika viruses rely on polyamines for viral translation and genome replication [ 26 ] ; however , whether similar processes are affected for other viruses and precisely how polyamines function during CVB3 replication remain to be completely understood .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 303}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 520}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 527}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 556}, "obj": "ne"}]}
