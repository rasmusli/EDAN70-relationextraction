This coloured complex , which absorbs at 532 nm , results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment . This method is not very specific , because 4 - hydroxyalkenals , 2 , 4 - alkadienals and 2 - alkenals , protein and sugar degradation products , amino acids , nucleic acids and anthocyanins are also able to react with TBA , forming a chromophore [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 41}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 47}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 82}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 190}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 196}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 285}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 305}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 395}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 417}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 434}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 489}, "obj": "ne"}]}
