Delays in the provision of adequate antimicrobial therapy have been reported to be associated with excess mortality [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ; therefore , rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia is essential for successful treatment . In recent years , bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) has been established as a useful technique for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens from the alveolar level , and can thus be used to accurately define the causa organisms of pneumonia [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . However , a conventional culture usually takes at least a few days , and microbiological yield is often compromised by prior empirical usage of antimicrobial agents . In addition , identification of viruses and atypical organisms requires a separate etiologic work - up . Cellular analysis of BAL fluid , including total and differential cell counts and the CD4 + : CD8 + T - lymphocyte ratio , is useful for the diagnosis of various interstitial lung diseases [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Under an appropriate clinical setting , BAL fluid analysis can provide highly suggestive or even diagnostic information for specific interstitial lung diseases in the absence of a lung biopsy [ 10 ] . However , only a few previous studies with limited patient populations [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] have evaluated the role of cellular analysis of BAL fluid in patients with suspected pneumonia . Most of these studies focused on the differential diagnosis of pneumonia from non - infectious pulmonary diseases , not on the prediction of pneumonia etiology . BAL fluid analysis can be performed within several hours . Therefore , such analysis would be useful for guiding early treatment if it could predict the etiology of pneumonia , similar to the role of cerebrospinal fluid cellular analysis , which can reliably differentiate among meningitis etiologies . Therefore , this study investigated whether analysis of the cellular profile of BAL fluid can predict the etiology of pneumonia in critically ill patients admitted to the medical ICU .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
