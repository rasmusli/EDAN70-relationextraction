The antibiotic susceptibility test data demonstrate an alarming resistance level of K . pneumaniae , showing 100 % resistance against azithromycin , 55 % resistance against each of ceftriaxone , cefixime and ciprofloxacin ; 27 % and 45 % resistance frequencies against Gentamicin and Tobramycin , respectively .
