Triplicate cultures for each cat were treated with either 4 \u03bcg / mL ODN 2216 or 2243 or an equal volume of endotoxin - free PBS . After an initial incubation of 18 h , the cells were pulsed for 24 h with 3 H - thymidine ( Perkin Elmer , Schwerzenbach , Switzerland ) . Standard liquid scintillation protocols were used for harvesting of the cells and uptake of 3 H was assessed with the Packard Tri - Carb 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer ( Perkin Elmer ) . Proliferation rates were calculated as the mean counts per minute ( c . p . m ) of triplicate cultures . The stimulation index ( SI ) depicted in Figure 1 was calculated as follows :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 198}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 206}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 341}, "obj": "ne"}]}
