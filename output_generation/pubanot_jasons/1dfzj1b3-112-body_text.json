Citral exhibited an inhibitory activity in LPS - induced iNOS protein expression , not found for COX - 2 . The authors studied the effect of citral on NF - \u03baB pathway for enlightening the mechanism of the citralmediated inhibition of iNOS transcription . The authors concluded that citral could prevent the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in LP - induced inflammation and reduce the p50 NF - \u03baB levels in nuclear fractions [ 121 ] . In another study , it was reported that in human macrophage - like U937 cells , citral suppressed both LPS - induced COX - 2 mRNA and protein expression , dose - dependently . Moreover , citral induced the mRNA expression of the PPAR\u03b1 and the PPAR\u03b3 , suggesting that citral activates PPAR\u03b1 and\u03b3 , and regulates COX - 2 expression [ 147 ] . A same behaviour was observed for carvacrol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 56}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 74}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 136}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 194}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 335}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 407}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 476}, "obj": "ne"}]}
