Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories , these results indicate that IFITMs can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle , in target cells as well as in virus - producing cells . These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 75}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 246}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 409}, "obj": "ne"}]}
