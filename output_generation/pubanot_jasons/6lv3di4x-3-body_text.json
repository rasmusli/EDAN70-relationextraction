Infected pigs normally present mild neurological symptoms , but the infection of pregnant sows can cause abortions and stillbirth ( 7 ) . Although JEV infection is typically mosquito borne , contact transmission and high susceptibility to oronasal infection have been described ( 8 ) . Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that JEV can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs , independently of the route of inoculation , for a period of 5 days , with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of viremia ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) . Furthermore , mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions ( 13 ) . These findings represent a warning that JEV could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito - free periods . In fact , a reemergence of JEV in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan ( 14 ) . It is also important to note that vector - free transmission of mosquito - borne flaviviruses is not restricted to JEV and pigs . Several species , including macaques , mice , hamsters , guinea pigs , rats , and squirrel hamsters , are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) . In addition , nonvector - borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses ( 18 , 19 ) . Examples are Zika virus ( ZIKV ) ( 20 , 21 ) , West Nile virus ( WNV ) ( 22 , 23 ) , St . Louis encephalitis virus ( SLEV ) ( 24 ) , Bagaza virus ( BAGV ) ( 25 ) , Tembusu virus ( TMUV ) ( 26 ) , and Wesselsbron virus ( WESSV ) ( 27 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
