Tissue culture will ensure that the sources of the medicinal plants will not be exhausted or overexploited for their secondary metabolites . This is because the number of wild plants will not be effected due to overharvesting of the respective plants . Moreover the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques . Previously , Yew et al . [ 18 ] have reported the effect of different cytokinin on in vitro shoot length and multiplication of H . littoralis . By adjusting phytohormones concentrations in the medium , differences in amount , rate , and growth patterns of explants were observed [ 19 , 20 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 589}, "obj": "ne"}]}
