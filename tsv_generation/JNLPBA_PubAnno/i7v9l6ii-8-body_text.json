{"cord_uid": "i7v9l6ii", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4067073", "divid": "8", "text": "Virus specific nucleic acid detection was performed using a multiplex kit from Beckman Coulter ( Miami , USA ) as described in detail 2 . This panel covered 11 different serotypes of Influenza virus and 11 viral serotypes among 6 viruses suspected to cause common upper respiratory tract infections ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Target specific cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcriptase primer plex kit and for the GenomeLab GeXP start kit ( Beckman Coulter ) . Reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction was performed in 20\u00b5L reaction volume using 12\u00b5L of extracted nucleic acid , 4\u00b5L of GeXP 5X RT buffer , 2\u00b5L of RT primer plex and 1\u00b5L each of undiluted Kan - r and reverse transcriptase enzyme . The reaction was initiated at 48 o C for 1 minute followed by 42 o C for 60 minutes and terminated at 95 o C for 5 minutes ; the synthesised cDNA was kept at 4 o C before using for PCR analysis . PCR reaction was performed in 20\u00b5L reaction volume using 9 . 3\u00b5L of synthesized cDNA , 4\u00b5L 5X PCR buffer , 4\u00b5L , 25mM MgCl 2 , 2\u00b5L PCR primer plex and 0 . 7\u00b5L of Thermo Start DNA polymerase ( Thermo Scientific Inc . Fullerton , CA , USA ) . The PCR reaction was initiated at 95 o C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds , 55 o C for 30 seconds and 70 o C for 1 minute . The PCR product was maintained at 4 o C prior to fragment analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 701}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 979, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1030, "end": 1046}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1061, "end": 1089}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
