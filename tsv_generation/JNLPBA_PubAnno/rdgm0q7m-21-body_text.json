{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "21", "text": "PCBP family members have three KH domains , an adjacent pair ( KH1 and KH2 ) close to the N - terminus and a third ( KH3 ) towards the C - terminus , separated from KH1 and KH2 by an intervening sequence of variable length ( Figure 3D ) . To test the involvement of individual KH domains in PRF , amino acid substitutions ( to GDDG ) were introduced within the conserved , hallmark GxxG loop in each domain , which forms part of the RNA binding domain . These mutations have been shown previously to abolish RNA bind - ing activity of the individual domain without compromising its stability ( 37 ) . As shown in Figure 5A and B , mutation of the KH2 domain of PCBP1 or PCBP2 had little , if any , effect on frameshifting , whereas the KH3 domain mutation essentially abolished trans - activation . The KH1 domain mutation had a more varied phenotype . With PCBP1 , frameshift - stimulation was greatly reduced , but for PCBP2 , \u2212 2 PRF was diminished four - fold , but full activity in \u2212 1 PRF was retained . Further , whilst addition of PCBP1 KH1m or PCBP1 KH3m alone was unable to stimulate PRF , when ( A ) EMSA analysis of binding of nsp1 [UNK] , PCBP1 or PCBP2 ( alone or in combination ) to a short ( 58 nt ) 32 P - labelled in vitro transcript containing the PRRSV PRF signal . After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 10 min , reactions were loaded onto a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel and , following electrophoresis , the gel was fixed , dried and subjected to autoradiography . Numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of protein ( s ) with respect to the radiolabelled RNA ( 10 nM ) . In lanes BSB , DB and W , RNA was incubated alone with band - shift buffer , protein dilution buffer or water , respectively ( see ' Materials and Methods ' section ) . ( B ) The composition of RNA - protein complexes was investigated by supershift assay . Complexes were prepared with 10 nM RNA and a 50 - fold molar excess of nsp1 [UNK] ( N ) and PCBP2 ( P ) and subjected to EMSA directly ( N , P2 , NP2 ) , or after incubation with monoclonal ( mono ) or polyclonal ( poly ) antisera raised against PCBP2 ( \u2423 P2 , mono ) or nsp1 \u2424 ( \u2423 N , mono or poly ) . As controls , the radiolabelled RNA probe was incubated with either DB , the \u2423 P2 mono or the \u2423 N poly . added together , a partial restoration of both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF ( to about 20 % of the WT value ) was observed ( Figure 5C ) . Note that in all assays , frameshift - stimulation remained dependent upon addition of nsp1 \u2424 ( Figure 5D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 20}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 67}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 75}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 658}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 667}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 670, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 740}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 807}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 864}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 927}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 937}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1050}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1094, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1139, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1158}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1161, "end": 1167}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1216, "end": 1252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1794, "end": 1818}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1928, "end": 1933}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1949, "end": 1955}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1957, "end": 1959}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
