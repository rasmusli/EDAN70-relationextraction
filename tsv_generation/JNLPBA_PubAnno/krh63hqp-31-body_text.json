In certain sites of the HA1 genomic segment of H3 , non - synonymous substitutions occur at more than twice the rate as in other sites [ 39 ] . This is seen as a major signature of adaptive change , but deleterious mutations in the areas not under selection are carried along with the ones under positive selection [ 36 ] . In this light , some perceive H1N1 to be a growing threat , with a new outbreak being just a matter of time . Despite this common perception , a more lethal version of H1N1 has not arisen via mutation within the human population during the last 90 + years . This is significant . The two major human influenza pandemics since 1918 did not arise due to mutations within H1N1 , but arose via horizontal transmission of new genetic material from bird influenza strains , creating recombinant viruses . They were also less lethal than the 1918 version . It is true that the population had a degree of residual immunity and was not as immunologically na\u00efve as it was in 1917 - 18 , but selection has still not been able to generate a devastating pandemic from the remnants of that which swept the world at the close of WWI .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 556}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 752, "end": 757}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
