Despite high conservation in the rest of the PARP4 protein , the sequence and length of the largest exon ( corresponding to human exon 30 ) in PARP4 is highly variable among vertebrates . Consistent with our results in primates , all closely related pairs of vertebrate PARP4 orthologs analyzed demonstrated a signature of purifying selection throughout much of PARP4 contrasting with evidence for positive selection in the region corresponding to exon 30 of human PARP4 ( Figure 2D and Table S3 ) . To gain further insight into PARP4 evolution outside of primates , we asked whether other mammalian lineages show evidence for recurrent positive selection as we observed in primates . To do this , we took advantage of publicly available bat genome sequences , which , like primates , are divergent enough to provide sufficient evolutionary divergence , but not so divergent that the rate of synonymous mutation ( dS ) is saturated . Using sequences from 10 bat species ( Alignment S2 ) , we again found that PARP4 has evolved under recurrent positive selection in its largest exon ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS pvalue , 0 . 01 ) ( Figure S2B - C ) . PAML identified six positively sites with high confidence ( Figure S2B - C , Table S5 ) . Although there is no overlap between positively selected sites identified in primates and bats , we found nine residues to be absolutely conserved across all 25 primate and bat species we analyzed ( Figure S2B - C ) , suggesting substantial constraint even within this rapidly evolving disordered protein domain . Combined , these broader phylogenetic analyses indicate that a single PARP4 region has been subject to positive selection throughout mammalian and bird evolution , suggestive of an ancient conflict with intracellular pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 62}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 146, "end": 160}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 469}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 636}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 839, "end": 850}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1110, "end": 1116}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1185, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1213, "end": 1220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1264}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1326, "end": 1334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1386, "end": 1412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1555, "end": 1563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1661}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1733, "end": 1746}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
