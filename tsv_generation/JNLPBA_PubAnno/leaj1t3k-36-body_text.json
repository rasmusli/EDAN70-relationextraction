{"cord_uid": "leaj1t3k", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4033964", "divid": "36", "text": "While studying the delivery of anti - HSV - 1 antivirals using a peptide derived from FGF4 signal peptide , Bultmann et al . found that the peptide itself exerted antiviral activity [ 107 ] . This discovery led them to investigate the intrinsic antiviral properties of a range of peptides against HSV - 1 infection in cultured cells . Tested peptides included EB ( stands for entry blocker ; it is a modified FGF4 signal peptide ) , tat , KLA ( a synthetic amphipatic peptide ) , and HOM ( derived from Drosophila antennapedia protein ) , and their modified peptides [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] . In particular , a tat peptide containing a cysteine residue at its C - terminal ( tat - C ) was shown to be able to inhibit infection in three ways : irreversibly inactivating virions exposed to tat - C prior to cell infection , blocking entry of cell - adsorbed viruses , and inducing a state of resistance to infection in cells pretreated with tat - C ( Figure 1 ) [ 109 ] . Mechanisms of antiviral activities have not been determined yet but tat - C seems to act by inhibiting viral entry at the fusion step rather than at the virus attachment step . Virion inactivation may result from tat - C binding to sialic acids on the viral envelop glycoproteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 91}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 535}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 615}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 673}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 947}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1038, "end": 1046}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
