Resulting effects include the stimulation of short - chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production and the proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp . and Bifidobacterium spp . [ 122 , 123 ] . Common prebiotics include inulin and oligosaccharides such as galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) and fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) [ 124 ] . Pigs fed with chito - oligosaccharides ( COS ) showed better overall intestinal health ( based on villi height ) , improved performance ( measured by body weight gain and feed conversion ratio ) and higher Lactobacillus counts than those found in control pigs or pigs receiving diets supplemented with chlortetracycline [ 125 ] . Also , fermented ingredients , such as non - starch polysaccharide hydrolysis products of soybean meal ( SBM ) in weaned pig feed , were found to interfere with attachment of ETEC to enterocytes and were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during ETEC infection [ 126 ] . It was shown that the prebiotic \u03b2 - galactomannan ( \u03b2GM ) inhibited the in vitro adhesion of ETEC on the cell surface of porcine intestinal IPI - 2I cells , and decreased the mRNA ETECinduced gene expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines such as TNF - \u03b1 , IL - 6 , GM - CSF and chemokines on intestinal IPI - 2I cells [ 127 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1176}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1300, "end": 1312}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1331, "end": 1360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1387, "end": 1396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1400, "end": 1411}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
