Injected honeybee pupae extracted as well as positive controls using 200 \u00b5L TN buffer . Fifty microliters of the homogenate was transferred to 1 . 5 - mL Eppendorf \u00ae tubes and the RNA extraction was done using a NucleoSpin \u00ae RNA II kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Oensingen , Switzerland ) following the manufacturer ' s recommendations . In the final step , RNA was eluted in 30 \u00b5L of elution buffer and stored at \u2212 80 \u2022 C [ 57 ] . To monitor the efficiency of the RNA purification and cDNA synthesis , tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV , 1 \u00b5L TMV solution ( 1 : 1000 ) ) was used as an exogenous internal reference added to each sample at the first step of the RNA extraction [ 58 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 561}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 823}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
