Figure 2 shows the results of this robustness evaluation , for pseudoknotted structures ( Figure 2A ) , pseudoknot - free structures ( Figure 2B ) and the overall results ( Figure 2C ) . Since HFold - PKonly cannot add pseudoknot - free base pairs to the given input structure , we do not compare its performance here with HFold and Iterative HFold . However we provide detailed performance of all versions of HFold including HFold - PKonly in Additional file 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 435}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 628}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
