We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of FPL between 2014 and 2018 in Australia , New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) where FPL outbreaks had not been reported for several decades . Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved . Most cats with FPL were shelter - housed , 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis , unvaccinated , had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines . Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV , with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations . Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin . FPV vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases , highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co - incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats . Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter - housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks , likely precipitating the multiple re - emergence of infection events .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
