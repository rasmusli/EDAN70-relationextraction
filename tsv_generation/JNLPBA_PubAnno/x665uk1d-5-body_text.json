In addition , efficient degradation of RNAs by 3D8 scFv in the presence of EDTA demonstrates that 3D8 scFv does not need divalent metal ions for its RNase activity [ 23 ] . Additionally , 3D8 scFv has DNase and RNase activity but when the active sites of each VL and VH are changed from histidine ( 35 position in VH and 94 position in VL ) to alanine , respectively , by site - directed mutagenesis , the mutant 3D8 scFv loses DNase activity but retains RNase activity [ 24 ] . We previously showed that 3D8 scFv can be applied to protect PK15 cells from virus infection . PK15 cells harboring 3D8 scFv show resistance to classical swine fever virus ( CSFV ) through RNase activity [ 25 ] . Also , we previously found that progenies of the transgenic tobacco plant acquired complete resistances against two single stranded ( ss ) - DNA geminiviruses , four ssRNA tobamoviruses , and one ssRNA cucumovirus [ 26 , 27 ] . So far , chemicals or specific antibodies for viral proteins have been mostly used in antiviral agents . But , 3D8 scFv with a completely different mechanism than antiviral agents is expected to be effective against a broad spectrum of viral infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 55, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 156}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 224}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 645}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 649, "end": 655}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 665}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 708, "end": 711}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 715, "end": 718}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 762, "end": 765}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 870}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 882}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 962}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1116, "end": 1122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1390, "end": 1410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1414, "end": 1429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1479, "end": 1488}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
