Although neurons remain the main target cell of TBEV , astrogliosis have been shown in post mortem human brains [ 142 , 143 ] . In vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of IFN after TBEV infection , which is able to protect neighboring astrocytes and neurons from infection already 6 and 3 h post infection , respectively [ 100 ] . Astrocytes have been shown to be resistant to TBEV - induced cytopathic effects [ 144 , 145 ] , and it was later shown that IFNAR expression protected the astrocytes from the virus - induced cytopathic effects [ 100 ] . Pretreatment of cells with IFNs strongly inhibits growth of most TBFVs in cell culture [ 100 , 103 , [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] and this is due to the upregulation and concerted actions of several hundreds of ISGs . Only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection [ 86 , 141 , 147 , 149 , 150 ] . One of them , the 2 - 5 - oligoadenylate synthetase ( 2 - 5 - OAS ) ( OAS ) is activated by double - stranded RNA , leading to the OAS protein polymerization into 2 - 5 - linked oligoadenylates ( 2 - 5As ) [ 151 , 152 ] . These 2 - 5As activate RNase L , resulting in the degradation of viral RNA [ 153 ] . Several polymorphisms in the OAS genes have been shown to correlate with severe forms of TBE in patients [ 154 ] . Also , the murine isoform Oas1b , which is often lacking in inbred mice strains , confers strain dependent resistance against neurovirulence from far eastern TBEV [ 155 ] . Two other ISGs which have been shown to be antivirally active against TBEV are virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum associated interferon inducible ( viperin ) and tripartite motif - 79\u03b1 ( TRIM79\u03b1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 632, "end": 638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 947}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1115, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1175}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1192, "end": 1196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1306, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1348, "end": 1358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1509, "end": 1515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1666, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1760, "end": 1814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1816, "end": 1824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1830, "end": 1853}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1855, "end": 1863}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
