Interestingly , this mechanism of inhibition seems to be active against both pH - dependent and - independent viruses that require or not the low pH of endosomes to trigger viral - to - cell membrane fusion [ 22 , 23 ] . The finding that pH - independent viruses can also functionally access the cytosol from endosomal vesicles likely explains the broad antiviral effects of IFITMs against these diverse classes of virus [ 24 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 20}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 614}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
