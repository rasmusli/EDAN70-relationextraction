This also indicates that PRV DNA was hydrolyzed immediately in virusinoculated STG90 muscle cells , and that the virus titer was not high enough to infect muscle cells . Therefore , PRV could not move systemically into the spinal cord or brain in STG90 mice . However , STG135 mice were not protected against PRV infection even though 3D8 scFv protein was expressed in the brain ( Figure 7A ) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice . We interpret these data to indicate that the expression and presence of antiviral proteins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues . Blood biochemistry ( Table 1 ) and body weight changes for 7 weeks after birth ( Figure S5A and S5B ) were not significantly different between STG90 and WT mice . Also , we identified the expression patterns of endogenous genes including apoptosis ( K - ras and BAX ) , growth factor ( VEGF ) , and housekeeping ( GAPDH ) genes between STG90 and wild - type mice ; however , there was no difference ( Figure S5C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 88}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 187}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 725}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1076}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1078, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1127, "end": 1156}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
