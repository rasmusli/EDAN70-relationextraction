Three saliva and three fecal pools were shotgun sequenced , each containing nucleic acid extractions from swabs collected from ten vampire bats from one to two colonies . Pooled samples contained individuals from the same colonies of bats tested for Bartonella in blood through PCR , though not necessarily the same individuals .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
