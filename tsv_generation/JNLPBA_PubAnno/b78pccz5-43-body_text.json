In a case where indoor sources cannot be removed or their emissions cannot be limited to an accepted level , ventilation needs to be increased to remove remaining pollutants . In these cases outdoor air pollution become the major source of pollution in indoors , and it needs to be taken into account .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
