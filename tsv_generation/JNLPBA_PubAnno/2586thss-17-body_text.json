This indicated that the HCV antigen did not cross - react with other common viral antibodies and thus , was highly specific to HCV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 573}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
