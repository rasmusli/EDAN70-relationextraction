Several MERS - CoV - encoded proteins have been identified to be IFN antagonists . We , and others , have characterized at least three IFN - antagonizing proteins encoded by MERS - CoV . In addition to the M protein reported in this study , ORF4a is a dsRNA - binding protein , which directly inhibits RLR activation induced by dsRNA and / or the protein co - activator PACT . 24 , 25 In addition , our unpublished data also revealed that ORF4b is a potent IFN antagonist . This is in line with findings by other groups although the mechanistic details of its action have not well documented . 22 , 23 One recent report suggested that ORF4b might not only interact directly with TBK1 / IKK\u03b5 in the cytoplasm but also perturb IFN production in the nucleus through an as yet unknown mechanism . 61 Nevertheless , how M , ORF4a , ORF4b and the other IFN - antagonizing proteins of MERS - CoV coordinate with each other to modulate the host innate antiviral response to facilitate viral replication and propagation remains elusive .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 343}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 403}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 762, "end": 768}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 818}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 946, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 954, "end": 960}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 1002}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
