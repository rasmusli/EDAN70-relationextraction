A recent study demonstrated that the last four amino acids in this region impact the virulence of the virus [ 27 ] ; if the final sequence is ETRL then the virus is attenuated due to induction of neuronal apoptosis . According to this study , virulent , wild type RABV haplotypes have QTRL as the terminal sequence , and do not cause apoptosis of the host cell . The impact of the ETGL haplotype on viral virulence is unclear , although it did not perceptibly impact virulence in skunks and foxes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
