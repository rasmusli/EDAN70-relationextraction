PB1 - F2 has been implicated in increasing host death rate . Yet , not all influenza viruses code for this protein , so it is not intrinsically necessary for the cycle of infection . In the case of H1N1 , the majority ( 98 . 2 % ) of genomes in this study are predicted to fail to produce a full - length version of the protein , including most of the human versions after 1948 and none of the porcine versions prior to 1987 . For this reason , only 10 of the 11 influenza proteins were included in RSCU and NCS calculations . All genomes were predicted to produce fully - formed PB2 , PB1 , PA , HA , NP , NA , M1 , M2 , and NS1 proteins . Only 14 genomes were expected to fail to produce a functioning NS2 protein due to mutation in the start codon , but all of these had another potential in - frame ATG only a few codons upstream and / or downstream . For this reason , we assumed these viruses would also produce an NS2 protein of proper length .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 90}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 158, "end": 167}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 742}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 862, "end": 874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 897, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 996}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1091}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
