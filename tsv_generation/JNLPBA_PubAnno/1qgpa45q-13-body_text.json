The nucleoprotein gene was the most conserved among all subgroups at the nt and aa levels . SH and G glycoprotein genes were more divergent between the HMPV subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63 % identity , respectively . The SH protein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution ( CAA [UNK] TAA ) at gene position 532 in group B , resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa , respectively . The predicted G protein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups , between 219 and 241 aa , due to different positions of the Stop codon . Amino acid sequence diversity for G and SH glycoproteins is depicted in Fig . 2 and Additional file 2 : Figure S2 , respectively . The diversity of the complete nucleotide sequences of SH and G genes is depicted in phylogenetic trees in Fig . 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 336}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 688}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 873}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1001, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
