Detailed mapping analysis of the cellular responses induced by either the Brazilian or MR766 prME vaccines revealed that both vaccines induced a significant cellular response against the dominant Env - specific CTL epitope as identified in Figure 2b and c for the consensus ZIKV - prME plasmid ( data not shown ) . The consensus immunogen consistently induced more robust responses in these T - cell assays at the same dose and was evaluated further in additional assays .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 275}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 391}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
