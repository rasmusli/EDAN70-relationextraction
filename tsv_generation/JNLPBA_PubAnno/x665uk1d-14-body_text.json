SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) 80 min after the 6carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) - labeled DNA substrate was introduced into the cells . However , the fluorescence output from HeLa cells , muSCH cells , and the negative control reactant was a maximum of 200 RFU or less ( Figure 4A ) . When the FAM - labeled RNA substrate was introduced into cells , SCH07072 and muSCH cells had fluorescence levels of about 200 RFU , but HeLa cells and the negative control reactant showed fluorescence levels of only 80 RFU ( Figure 4B ) . These FRET results confirmed that 3D8 scFv in SCH07072 had both DNase and RNase activity , but that only RNase activity was observed in muSCH cells ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , the protection against the virus infection shown by SCH07072 cells was due to 3D8 scFv nuclease activity against the virus genome itself .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 766}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 828, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 994}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1028}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
