We subdivided the peptides from H8 and V8 in four new pools each containing five peptides ( H8 . 1 , H8 . 2 , V8 . 1 , V8 . 2 ) . In addition , we separately tested the two 15mer peptides # 89 and # 90 , which were shared between pools H8 and V8 . We again vaccinated BALB / c mice with MVA - MERS - N using i . p . or i . m . inoculations in a prime - boost regime . Splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified CD8 + T cells were restimulated with subpools V8 . 1 . , V8 . 2 . , H8 . 1 , and H8 . 2 ( Figure 4a ) . Stimulation with peptides from pools V8 . 1 or H8 . 1 activated only minor levels of IFN - \u03b3 producing cells with mean levels about 23 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes . Yet , the stimulation with subpools V8 . 2 and H8 . 2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated T cells with 83 - 176 IFN - \u03b3 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes . Comparable numbers of IFN - \u03b3 producing cells were again induced by i . p . or i . m . immunization . Of note , the stimulations with the 15 - mer peptides # 89 ( N353 - 367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK ) or # 90 ( N357 - 371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP ) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of IFN - \u03b3 producing cells ( mean levels about 71 - 107 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes ) in mice that had been vaccinated with MVA - MERS - N by both immunization routes ( Figure 4b ) . CD8 + T cells purified from mice receiving non - recombinant MVA or mock vaccine ( PBS ) did not produce IFN - \u03b3 following stimulation with peptides from subpools V8 . 1 - H8 . 2 and with peptides # 89 and # 90 . When checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools , we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides # 89 and # 90 were part of the subpools V8 . 2 and H8 . 2 , whereas these peptides were absent in V8 . 1 and H8 . 1 . This data suggested that the overlapping 15 - mer peptides # 89 and # 90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS - CoV N - specific CD8 + T cell responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 645}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 653, "end": 658}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 885, "end": 888}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 901}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1575, "end": 1583}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1633, "end": 1638}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
