Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 show these workflows for distance - based algorithms , maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms , respectively . The workflows use ClustalW [ 10 ] to compute multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic algorithms from the PHYLIP package [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
