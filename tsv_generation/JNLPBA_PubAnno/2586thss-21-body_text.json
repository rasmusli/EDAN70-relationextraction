Our study demonstrates that the full - length core protein has better reactivity than C22 . It is possible that the C - terminal domain of the core protein contains key peptide sequences for constructing the viral particle and regulating viral assembly ( 4 , 20 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
