In contrast , selection to increase the breadth of antiviral specificities could also lead to increase in gene copy number [ 34 ] . As a result of these repeated rounds of innovations , many organisms undergo dramatic changes in their antiviral gene repertoires over evolutionary timeframes , as has been observed with APOBEC and TRIM genes in mammals [ 38 , 39 ] . In our initial evolutionary screen , we had observed that most of PARP15 is missing from the whitecheeked gibbon genome . Coupled with previous findings of PARP15 absence in the mouse genome [ 10 ] , we therefore investigated PARP genes in general , with an emphasis on the macro - PARP genes , for signatures of rapid gene turnover .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 775}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 838, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 905}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
