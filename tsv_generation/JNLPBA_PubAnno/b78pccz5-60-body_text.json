Carbon monoxide is lethal at high exposure levels and more efficient dilution by higher ventilation may not be sufficient . However , for all these pollutants the benefits of higher ventilation rates are calculated assuming the mass - balance for a constant source term .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
