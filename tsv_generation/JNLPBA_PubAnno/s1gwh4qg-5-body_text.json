For instance in Uni - Prot , the primary accession number is the sole UID . In GenBank three fields , locus , accession and version , carry four different IDs , but only gi number ( known also as primary ID ) and accession number combined with version form unique IDs ( UIDs ) . Each UID is assigned to a single entry . In contrast , a particular non - unique ID may be found in numerous entries . The UIDs ensure efficient computer - mediated data storage , maintenance and processing . To facilitate data mapping and transfer between different databases , in which ID inter - conversion plays important part , several specialized resources including GoMiner [ 3 ] , ErmineJ [ 4 ] , SOURCE [ 5 ] , RESOURCERER [ 6 ] ; IDconverter and IDClight [ 7 ] , and DAVID [ 8 ] have been developed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 125}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 605, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 723, "end": 728}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
