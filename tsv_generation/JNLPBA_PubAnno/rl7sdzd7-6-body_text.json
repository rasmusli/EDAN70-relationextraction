{"cord_uid": "rl7sdzd7", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2656497", "divid": "6", "text": "An alternative DNA amplification method was described by Notomi and coworkers [ 2 ] called ' loop mediated isothermal amplification ' ( LAMP ) . The LAMP assay relies on the design of a set of primers that generate stem looped ( hairpin ) structures during the early stage of DNA synthesis . The hairpin structures form because two of the primers used contain , at their 5 ' end , a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site . Displacement primers help the formation of these hairpins at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed , these structures can be copied into a series of DNA fragments containing multiple units of the target sequence under isothermal conditions utilizing the displacement properties of Bst polymerase ( see [ 3 ] ) . Although LAMP was first described using a set of four primers , enhanced sensitivity was reported using an additional pair of loop primers [ 4 ] . As the reactions are performed at a single temperature , LAMP assays can be performed very quickly since there are no separate denaturation , annealing and extension steps , and as such , reactions do not require thermalcyclers . Here we assess the LAMP protocol for the detection of GMOs using primers that target event - specific sequences for transgenic MS8 and RF3 oilseed rape ( Brassica napus L . ) and generic GMO sequences such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter ( P - 35S ) and the promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene ( P - nos and T - nos , respectively ) from Agrobacterium spp .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 664}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1377, "end": 1391}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1443, "end": 1451}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1474, "end": 1485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1493, "end": 1516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1518, "end": 1526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1530, "end": 1538}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
