In the early pioneer work on IFN in the fifties and sixties , TBEV served as a model system , and TBEV was shown to induce IFN after infection and was also sensitive to pretreatment of IFNs [ 80 , [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] . Pretreatment of IFN was also found to inhibit KFDV , OHFV , and POWV titers in A549 cells ( adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells ) [ 103 ] , thus IFN pretreatment induced broad spectrum inhibition of TBFVs . IFN has also been found to be strongly induced in the brains of POWV infected Peromyscus lecuopus , which are known as a natural host of the virus [ 104 ] . Similarly , IFN was found to be induced in sheep infected with LIV [ 105 ] , and IFN - stimulated genes were induced in brains of KFDV infected mice , indicating an activated IFN response [ 106 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 45}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 364}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 573}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 742}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 830}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 905}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
