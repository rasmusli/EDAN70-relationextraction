First described as the mechanism by which the Gag - Pol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs ( 4 ) , related \u2212 1 PRF signals have been documented in many other viruses of clinical , veterinary and agricultural importance ( reviewed in Ref . 5 ) . PRF has also been increasingly recognized in conventional cellular genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicating elements , such as insertion sequences and transposons ( 6 , 7 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 52}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 158, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 195}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 309}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 397}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 489}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 643, "end": 647}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 716}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 792}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 822}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 826, "end": 838}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
