Briefly , inactivation was achieved by dialysis against 0 . 1 % formalin for 3 days . After inactivation , the virus was dialyzed against PBS . We labelled the inactivated virus through an incubation of 1 h at room temperature with a 1 : 1 ( v / v ) 0 . 5 mol / L bicarbonate buffer solution ( pH 9 . 5 ) containing 0 . 1 mg / mL of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . The virus was dialyzed in PBS to release unbound FITC , using Pur - A - Lyzer tubes ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , for 6 h .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
