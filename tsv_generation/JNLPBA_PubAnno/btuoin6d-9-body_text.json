We evaluated etiologies by sputum , nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions , blood , and urine using a microbiological culturing approach . Respiratory specimens were typically obtained from selfextracting sputum . When sputum specimens could not be obtained , upper respiratory tract specimens , such as oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs were used for viral PCR tests . Multiplex real - time PCR was performed using a Real - Q RV Detection kit ( BioSewoom , Seoul , Korea ) with a Roche Light Cycler 480 II instrument ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) . Respiratory viruses included in this test are as follows ; adenovirus , rhinovirus , influenza virus A / B , respiratory syncytial virus A / B , metapneumovirus , bocavirus , coronavirus , and parainfluenza virus 1 / 2 / 3 . All patients were given chest X - rays and / or high resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) at the time of our emergency department visit .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
