One dose of early N3 administration after CVA16 infection significantly prolonged survival but did not rescue the mice from developing neurological syndromes which eventually led to death ( Fig . S1 ) . This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross - neutralization of N3 against CVA16 ( Fig . S2 ) . Indeed , N3 was able to recognize CVA16 virions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA ( for na\u00efve protein interaction ; Fig . S3 ) and Western blot ( for denatured protein interaction ; Fig . S4 ) . In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains , N3 showed lower affinity to na\u00efve CVA16 ( Fig . S3 ) . Oppositely , anti - CVA16 antisera , obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16 , equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig . S4 . N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins of both B4 and C2 EV71 at approximately 35 kDa [ 17 , 21 ] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [ 22 ] that is different from anti - CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 486}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 762}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 985}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1013}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1084}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1192, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1268, "end": 1272}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
