As expected , IL - 6 and IL - 8 transcript level was decreased in ORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells ( Figure 5D ) . These experiments indicates that ORF2 protein , by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF - \u03baB activity , suppress TPA induced IL - 6 and IL - 8 RNA synthesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 83}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 92}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 502}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 548}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
