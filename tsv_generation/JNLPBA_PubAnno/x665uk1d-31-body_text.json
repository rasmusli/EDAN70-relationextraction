This antibody inhibits ( 1 ) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus by viral DNA degradation and ( 2 ) viral protein translation in the cytoplasm via viral RNA degradation . In other words , the 3D8 scFv protein attacks the virus DNA genome itself or its RNA transcripts in two different subcellular spaces ( nucleus and cytoplasm ) and at two different times ( viral replication and viral transcription ) ( Figure 9 ) . These antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv have not only been observed against viruses with a dsDNA genome but also ssRNA viruses such as CSFV [ 25 ] and several plant viruses such as geminivirus , tobamovirus , and cucumovirus [ 26 , 27 ] . Taken together , 3D8 scFv is a candidate antiviral protein that can potentially confer resistance to a broad spectrum of animal and plant viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 85}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 116}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 484}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 928}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
