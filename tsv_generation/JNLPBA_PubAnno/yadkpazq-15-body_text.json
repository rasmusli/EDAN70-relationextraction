At the time points indicated , cells were harvested and counted . 10 6 cells of either cell line were resuspended in 30 \u03bcL sample buffer ( 0 . 5 M Tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane , 5 % SDS , 10 % \u03b2mercaptoethanol , 40 % glycerol , and 0 . 05 % bromphenol blue ) and boiled at 95 \u00b0 C for 5 min . SDS - PAGE separation and submersed immunoblotting procedures were carried out as previously described [ 61 ] . The Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder ( Fermentas GmbH , St . Leon - Rot , Germany ) served as molecular weight standard marker for each blot . For protein visualization , membranes were first cut immediately below the 80kB marker band . The top and bottom membrane fractions were incubated with murine anti - human Mx MAb M143 ( generously provided by Dr J . Pavlovic , Institute for Virology , University of Z\u00fcrich , Switzerland ) and murine anti - \u03b2 - actin monoclonal antibody as a loading control ( Sigma Aldrich GMbH , Buchs , Switzerland ) respectively . Both fractions were subsequently incubated with a peroxidase - labelled goat anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson Immunoresearch , Newmarket , Suffolk , UK ) . Bands were digitalized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System ( Syngene , Cambridge , UK ) . With the exception of assays carried out with FPV , viral inhibition experiments were conducted simultaneously and with supernatants thawed an equal number of times . The treated cells were then inoculated with virus ( VSV , FCV , FHV , FCoV ) or trypsinized with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco \u00ae , Invitrogen ) and allowed to settle in viral suspension ( FPV ) , and inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h ( 72 h for FCoV and FPV ) according to the procedure described previously [ 62 ] . Briefly , supernatants were discarded and cell debris was removed from the wells by 3 cycles of washing with Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) ( Gibco , Invitrogen ) and shaking on an orbital shaker for 15 s . Remaining cells were fixed with 5 % formalin and stained with a crystal violet solution . For spectrophotometric measurements , 100 % methanol was added to the dried out wells and absorbance was read at 595 nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microtiter plate reader ( Molecular Devices , Bucher Biotec AG , Basel , Switzerland ) . Viral inhibition rates were calculated with the following formula :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 888}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 997, "end": 1041}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1216}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1641, "end": 1649}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
