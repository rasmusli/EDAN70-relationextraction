The user submits sequence IDs , defines a format of conversion , and selects a database to be searched . Currently available databases include GenBank / RefSeq / GenPept , UniProt , EMBL , SeqHound and EnsEMBL ( Gene and Transcripts divisions for Human sequences ) . SNAD extracts IDs from the input and queries the database with these IDs to locate associated annotation . After retrieving annotation , SNAD designs names according to a name template that defines name structure and annotationbased content for submitted entries . The final step of the SNAD - mediated processing is substitution of submitted IDs in the input with the designed names to return results to the user .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 20}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 337}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 611}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
