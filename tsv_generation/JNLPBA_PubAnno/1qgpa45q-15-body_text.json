We checked the new HMPV genomes for nucleotide differences in the genomic regions targeted by our diagnostic rRT - PCR primers and probes ( Additional file 7 : Table S4 ) used for HMPV detection . Up to eight primer - and probetemplate mismatches were identified ( Fig . 4 ) : one mismatch in the forward primer region in HMPV group A ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig . 4a ) ; one mismatch in each of the forward and probe target regions in group B ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig . 4b ) ; and 5 different mismatches with the N - gene based rRT - PCR assay ( Fig . 4c ) . Note , the F gene - based rRT - PCR assays are different or specific to the two HMPV groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 497}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 717, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 776}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 799}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
