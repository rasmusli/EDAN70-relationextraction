To address this issue , two different luciferase reporter constructs , in which tandem copies of either IRF3 - or NF - \u03baB - binding elements were inserted into their promoter region , were used . The truncation mutant of RIG - I known as RIG - I N that contains only the N - terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways . 28 The MERS - CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3 - driven luciferase construct in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 2A ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF - \u03baB - driven construct ( Figure 2B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) although the canonical inhibitor I\u03baB - \u03b1 could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2 ) . Hence , the suppressive effect of the MERS - CoV M protein is specific for IRF3 signaling but not NF - \u03baB activation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 83}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 173}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 185}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 215}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 355}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 532, "end": 540}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 719, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 782}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 989, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1060, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1220, "end": 1247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1327, "end": 1335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1478, "end": 1499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1515, "end": 1520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1538, "end": 1546}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
