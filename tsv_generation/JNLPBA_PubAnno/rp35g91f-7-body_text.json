Based on the assumption that genes with highly correlated expression in a tissue are likely to act in a common network or biological process , Alberts et al . ( 2011 ) previously identified gene networks associated with specific B - and T - cell populations from this same whole - lung data set . We reasoned that we could use a similar approach with the lung data set to identify and characterize pulmonary myocardium cells using the cardiac troponin I type 3 ( Tnni3 ) gene ( previously shown to be expressed in pulmonary myocardium ) ( Millino et al . 2000 ) by investigating highly correlated transcripts associated with cardiac muscle . This yielded 24 transcripts significantly correlated with the expression of Tnni3 , which form the basis of a pulmonary myocardium gene network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 254}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 695}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 1005}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
