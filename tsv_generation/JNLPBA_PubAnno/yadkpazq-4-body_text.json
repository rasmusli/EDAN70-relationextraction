{"cord_uid": "yadkpazq", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3537549", "divid": "4", "text": "A promising addition to vaccination is the manipulation of innate immunity . Innate pathogen recognition relies on a set of sensory molecules , the Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , which enable the immediate reaction of specific immune cells to pathogen \" danger signals \" , the so - called pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) [ 4 ] . Due to their abundance in all bacterial as well as some viral genomes , oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) containing unmethylated cytosine - phosphate - guanosine ( CpG ) motifs are effectively recognized as PAMPs by the vertebrate innate immune system [ 5 ] . Response to CpG ODN stimulation is conferred through TLR9 , expressed mainly in the intracellular compartments of human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) [ 6 , 7 ] . Alarmed TLR9 is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms : upregulation of costimulatory molecules major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) II , B7 . 1 and B7 . 2 on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [ 8 , 9 ] and production of cytokines such as type I interferon ( IFN ) , interleukin ( IL ) - 12 , IFN\u03b3 , IL - 6 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) \u03b1 , contribute to providing an optimal immune environment for the development of innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens [ 10 , 11 ] . Probably the most important antiviral property of CpG ODN resides in their potential to stimulate the production of high amounts of type I IFN by pDCs [ 12 ] . This family of cytokines , which includes IFN\u03b1 , IFN\u03c9 and IFN\u03b2 , has been shown to considerably enhance natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity [ 13 ] , promote differentiation , maturation and immunostimulatory functions of monocytes and DCs [ 14 ] , induce B cell production of immunoglobulin [ 15 ] and T - helper ( Th ) 1 differentiation of T cells [ 16 , 17 ] . Moreover , upon binding to their ubiquitously distributed receptor , type I IFNs effectively induce the synthesis of various intracellular proteins which interfere with the replication of a broad range of viruses [ 18 ] . The myxovirusresistance protein ( Mx ) GTPase is a well - studied example of these intracellular antiviral effectors . This enzyme is known to be directly regulated by the type I IFN , and its detection is readily used as marker for upregulation and biological activity of this cytokine family [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 332}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 334, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 665}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 802}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 985}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 994}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 998, "end": 1005}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1127, "end": 1137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1145, "end": 1169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1199, "end": 1204}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1206, "end": 1213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1217, "end": 1249}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1536, "end": 1547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1606, "end": 1611}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1613, "end": 1618}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1622, "end": 1627}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1844, "end": 1859}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1964, "end": 1998}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
