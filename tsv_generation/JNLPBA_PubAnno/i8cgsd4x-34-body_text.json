After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes , proteins were blotted using anti - Culex STAT ( rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC ) , anti - WNV NS1 , anti - WNV NS5 [ 58 ] or anti - V5 ( Invitrogen ) antibody followed by anti - rabbit or anti - mouse secondary antibodies . After adding substrate , the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels . Anti - \u03b2 - actin antibody ( Abcam ) was used in immunoblots as a loading control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 573, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 615, "end": 649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 825}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 827, "end": 833}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
