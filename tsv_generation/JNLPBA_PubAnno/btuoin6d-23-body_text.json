The most important findings were that Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever after symptom onset and admission , a higher mean body temperature at admission , a higher number of patients with a body temperature over 39 \u00b0 C Fig . 2 Comparison to the changes in mean body temperature between the Adv - positive and Adv - negative group patients at admission day ( a ) and within 7 days after admission ( b ) . a Changes in mean temperature in four hours between the Adv and Non - Adv group patients within 24 h at admission ( 37 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 22 vs . 37 . 1 \u00b1 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 005 ) , b Comparison of the mean daily temperature between the Adv and Non - Adv group patients for a week ( P = 0 . 156 ) at admission , a longer duration of the maximal fall in body temperature at admission , and higher rate of no response to antipyretic treatment at admission compared to the Non - Adv group patients . In addition , the instances of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were greater in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv group patients , although in patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment , there was no difference between the two groups . Some epidemiological studies of Adv in South Korea military trainees and personnel have been performed . Yoo et al . [ 15 ] reported that adenovirus was identified in 33 . 0 % of all specimens in febrile respiratory illness ( FRI ) or pneumonia patients . This study was of reviewed military patients with FRI or pneumonia who were tested for respiratory viruses from October 2014 to May 2016 . The proportion of patients with pneumonia and the hospitalization rate did not differ between those with and without adenovirus infection . However , adenovirus - infected patients had a significantly higher risk of requiring intensive care or mechanical Table 3 Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretics between Adv , Non - Adv , and unknown pathogen group ventilator support . These notable findings indicate that adenovirus infection has been occasionally associated with mortality and morbidity with loss in combat strength and an increase in the cost of care .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
