These experiments proved that ORF2 specifically interacts with the F - box protein \u03b2TRCP . Direct interaction between ORF2 and \u03b2TRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pulldown assay . Full - length ORF2 as well as KDEL ORF2 ( ORF2 protein containing \" KDEL \" amino acids at its C - terminal end , which allows it to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of getting transported through the golgi ) and \u039435 ORF2 mutant were able to pull - down \u03b2TRCP ( Figure 4C , lane 3 , 4 , 5 ) . As negative controls , ORF2 transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre - immune serum ( Figure 4C , lane 6 ) or mock translated lysate was incubated with ORF2 protein bound to beads ( Figure 4C , lane 2 ) or , the ORF3 protein was incubated with \u03b2TRCP protein ( Figure 4C , lane 7 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 294}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 386}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 550}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 611}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 818}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 851}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
