{"cord_uid": "0hbeso65", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3655463", "divid": "27", "text": "Physiologically , SR - BI binds a variety of lipoproteins ( e . g . , HDL and LDL ) and is involved in bidirectional cholesterol transport at the cell membrane . The LEL of SR - BI has been demonstrated to interact with E2 HVR1 [ 93 ] . Recent studies suggest that the interplay between lipoproteins , SR - BI , and HCV envelope glycoproteins is required for HCV entry [ 94 , 95 ] . CLDNs are critical components of tight junctions , which regulate paracellular permeability and polarity . CLDN1 , a 23 kDa four - transmembrane protein , is predominantly expressed in the liver [ 96 ] . Intriguingly , CLDN1 may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes [ 97 ] . Recent studies suggest that nonjunctional CLDN1 may be also involved in HCV entry [ 48 , 98 ] . OCLN is a 65 kDa four transmembrane protein expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells . Several studies have shown that OCLN is probably involved in the late postbinding event of HCV entry [ 99 , 100 ] . As HCV circulates in the blood in association with LDL and VLDL , the LDL receptor has also been proposed as an attachment and / or entry factor for HCV [ 100 ] . The LDLR has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum - derived HCV into CD81 - deficient HepG2 cells by binding virus - LDL particles [ 101 ] . Since cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for HCV cell entry , it is rational that other cholesterol - uptake receptors might also have a role in this process . More recently , Niemann - Pick C1 - like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor ( NPC1L1 ) , a 13 - transmembranedomain cell surface cholesterol - sensing receptor , has been demonstrated as a new HCV entry factor [ 102 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 58}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 74}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 181}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 228}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 343}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 490, "end": 496}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 608}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 836}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1060}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1069}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1507, "end": 1566}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1568, "end": 1575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1581, "end": 1650}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1683, "end": 1700}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
