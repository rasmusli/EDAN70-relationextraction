RNA ( 5 \u03bcl ) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III ( 200 U , Invitrogen ) , RT buffer ( 1X final concentration , Invitrogen ) , and 2 \u03bcl of FPM in 20 \u03bcl reactions . An aliquot of cDNA ( 5 \u03bcl ) was amplified in 35 cycles using Phusion Highfidelity PCR kit ( New England Biolabs ) and 2 \u03bcl of PPM in a 25 \u03bcl reaction . The PCR mixture was incubated at 98 \u00b0 C for 30 s , followed by 35 cycles of 98 \u00b0 C for 10 s , 43 \u00b0 C for 30 s , and 72 \u00b0 C for 90s and a final extension of 72 \u00b0 C for 10 min . Expected PCR products for each amplicon were approximately 1500 bp . PCR products from the two reactions for each sample were pooled for Illumina library preparation . Fig . 4 Mismatches between the rRT - PCR diagnostic primers and probes and their expected binding sites in the five genomes from Kenya and Zambia . ' Fwd primer ' = Forward primer and ' Rev primer ' = Reverse primer . Two rRT - PCR assays were used for HMPV detection . The colored bars in the figure indicate nucleotide differences ( mismatches ) between ( a ) three HMPV - A genomes and HMPV - A specific primers and probes targeting fusion gene , ( b ) two HMPV - B genomes and HMPV - B specific primers and probes also targeting fusion gene , and ( c ) all five genomes reported here and specific primers and probes targeting nucleoprotein gene . The sequences of the rRT - PCR primers and probes checked against the African HMPV genomes are listed in Additional file 7 : Table S4 Illumina sequencing and data analysis Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit ( Illumina ) and pair - end sequencing ( 2 \u00d7 300 base pairs ) with the MiSeq Reagent V3 kit ( Illumina ) , following the manufacturer ' s instructions . The Nextera enzyme mix was used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and tag with universal adapters in a single tube reaction , followed by 12 - cycle PCR reaction for dual indexing . Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) were used for all purification steps and libraries were quantified and quality - checked using the Qubit ( Thermo Fisher ) and", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 626, "end": 639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 686, "end": 699}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 763}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 816, "end": 845}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 889}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 935, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 982}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 1001}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1017}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1174, "end": 1200}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1266, "end": 1292}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1351, "end": 1359}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1415, "end": 1434}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1457, "end": 1475}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1506, "end": 1527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1570, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1724, "end": 1730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1747, "end": 1756}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1810, "end": 1825}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
