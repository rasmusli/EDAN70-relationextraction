Tissue - resident macrophages , such as microglia , fail to develop in Csf1r \u2212 / \u2212 mice [ 9 ] , but in contrast to many tissue macrophages , adult microglia can still form in Csf1 op / op mice , which carry a natural null mutation in the Csf1 gene [ 33 ] . This is due to an alternative CSF1R ligand , IL - 34 , which is highly expressed by neurons [ 34 , 35 ] . Similar to Csf1 op / op mice , IL - 34 \u2212 / \u2212 mice develop fewer microglia but do not lack peripheral macrophages [ 36 ] . These mice are more susceptible to lethal neurotropic WNV infection , which is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis without increased viral replication [ 36 ] . In order to temporally control microglial depletion , pharmacologic agents that antagonize CSF1R have been developed , including antagonist PLX5622 , which depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [ 37 ] . These agents are being investigated as therapeutics in models of neurodegenerative diseases in which microglial activation is considered a contributing factor , such as traumatic brain injury [ 38 , 39 ] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [ 40 ] , and Alzheimer ' s disease [ 41 ] . Here , we used PLX5622 in a model of WNV encephalitis to examine the effect of CSF1R antagonism in the setting of neurotropic viral infection . Our results show that mice treated with PLX5622 are more susceptible to lethal WNV infection , which is associated with increased CNS viral burden and neuronal apoptosis . PLX5622 also reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and B7 co - stimulatory molecules within the infected CNS by depleting cellular sources , including resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages , as well as decreasing expression on peripheral antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) . The loss of APCs in the CNS resulted in limited local reactivation of recruited antiviral CD8 + T cells , which are required for virologic control in the CNS . Together , these data demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation during viral infection in both the CNS and periphery and highlight the importance of microglia in orchestrating cell - mediated antiviral immunity during neurotropic infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 22}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 358, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 430}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 871}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1394, "end": 1400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1666, "end": 1692}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1696, "end": 1726}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
