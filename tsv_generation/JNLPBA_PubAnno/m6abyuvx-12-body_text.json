We found that within 28 days after immunization the HCV core protein levels were significantly lower in livers of rVV - N25 - treated mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3A ) . Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that , within 28 days after immunization , levels of HCV core protein were substantially lower in the livers of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , neither resolution of chronic hepatitis nor reduction in the HCV protein levels was observed in the mice treated with LC16m8 , rVV - CN2 , or rVV - CN5 . These results indicated that HCV nonstructural proteins might be important for effects of therapeutic vaccines . In contrast , rVV - CN5 which encoded HCV structural and non - structural proteins did not show any significant effects . These results indicated that HCV structural proteins might have inhibited the therapeutic effects of the non - structural proteins . Therefore , it may be important to exclude the HCV structural proteins ( aa 1 - 541 ) as antigenic proteins when developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic hepatitis C .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 784, "end": 794}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 938, "end": 948}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1099}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1226, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1263}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1268, "end": 1287}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
