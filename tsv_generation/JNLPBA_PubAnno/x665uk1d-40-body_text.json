Briefly , fertilized mouse eggs were flushed from the oviducts of superovulated C57BL / 6NCrjBgi mice , and male pronuclei were injected with a 2 . 6 kb fragment ( 4 ng / ml ) of 3D8 scFv that had been obtained by digesting the pcDNA3 . 1 / V5 - His B ( 3D8 scFv ) vector with NruI / StuI / PvuI restriction enzymes . The injected eggs were reimplanted in the oviducts of pseudo - pregnant C57BL / 6NCrjBgi recipient females . At 3 weeks of age , the animals were tested for the presence of the transgene by PCR analysis of their genomic DNA using forward ( 59 CAGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAG 39 ) and reverse primers ( 59 CTGTTGAACAGACTCTGACTG 39 ) . The 3D8scFv TG founders ( F 0 lines ) were mated with wild - type C57BL / 6NCrjBgi mice to establish the transgenic lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines in a breeding program provided by Macrogen Co . The principles of laboratory animal care ( NIH publication 85 - 23 , revised 1986 ) were followed and all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the NVRQS , Korea .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 417}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 687}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 799}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
