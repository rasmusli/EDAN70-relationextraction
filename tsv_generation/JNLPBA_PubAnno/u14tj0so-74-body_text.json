[ 47 ] is a heuristic algorithm for prediction of pseudoknotted structures . This method incorporates SHAPE reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method . SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences , so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set . Therefore , we use data set of Hajdin et al . to compare these two methods . In their data set Hajdin et al . have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set . We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 energy structure as the final output of our program . For Shapeknots , we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al . [ 47 ] to compare with Iterative HFold . Table 5 shows the results of this comparison . In all but one sequence of the test set , Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots . The exception is the HIV - 1 5 ' pseudoknot domain ; Hajdin et al . note that the accepted structure of HIV - 1 5 ' pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots . In the training set , however , Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots . This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy . Since both the training and test data sets are small , we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1077}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1227, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1293, "end": 1304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1346, "end": 1357}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1435, "end": 1446}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1484, "end": 1495}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
