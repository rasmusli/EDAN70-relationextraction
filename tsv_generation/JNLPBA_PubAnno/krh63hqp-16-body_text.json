To calculate the normalized codon score , we downloaded the frequency of each of the 64 codons in the human , duck and domestic pig genomes from the Codon Usage Database [ 52 ] . We then created a predicted amino acid chain from each of the respective open reading frames . We calculated NCS for each protein by simply summing the frequency of each codon , as it is used in each of the three species , and then dividing by the total number of codons in the proteins produced . RSCU is simply the number of times any particular codon appears , divided by the number of times synonymous codons appear in that genome . Anhlan , et al . [ 51 ] were the first to apply RCSU to influenza genomic data , but they only studied one of the eleven protein products of the H1N1 genome and did not analyze changes over time . Here , we extend their techniques to create a time series in which one can better study shifts in codon usage due to mutation accumulation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 521}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 566}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 698}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1163, "end": 1180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1187, "end": 1199}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
