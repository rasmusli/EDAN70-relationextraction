To address this problem , we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transgene ; our system involves the Cre / loxP system and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recombinase [ 5 , 6 ] . Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV proteins could induce immune responses [ 5 ] and , therefore , obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on chronic liver pathology . Therefore , here , we used a Cre / loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression ; with this system , we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins . Folgori et al . ( 2006 ) reported effective vaccination of chimpanzees with an adenoviral vector and plasmid DNA encoding the HCV nonstructural region . This technique protected the liver tissues from acute hepatitis , which results when whole animals are challenged with virus [ 7 ] . However , this vaccine has not yet been shown to be effective against chronic HCV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 503}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 533}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 614}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 715}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1058, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1174, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1199, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
