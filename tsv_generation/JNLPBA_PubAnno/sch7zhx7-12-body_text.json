CVB3 plasmids containing either the 2A mutant protease or 3C mutant protease were used to clone the mutant proteases . To target the 2A and 2A mutant proteases , the primers included SacI and XbaI recognition sites ( Table 1 ) . Primers against the 3C and 3C mutant proteases included NotI and XbaI recognition sites . Protease sequences were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pFLAG - CMV - LAP1 vector . Clones were verified for sequencing ( GenScript , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequence for the wild - type and mutant 2A and 3C protease targets were designed and cloned into the pGlo - 3F vector and verified by sequencing ( GenScript ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 73}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 89}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 403}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 719, "end": 736}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
