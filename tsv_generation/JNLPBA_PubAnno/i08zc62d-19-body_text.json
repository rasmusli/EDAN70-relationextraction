Cp - NanI CD in complex with diplacone has the same side - chain orientation of Asp291 as in the substrate ( Neu5Ac ) complex . In addition , an extra water molecule ( W1 ) rather than the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac stabilizes the diplacone complex . Therefore , together with the kinetic inhibition assay , the structure of the Cp - NanI CDdiplacone complex suggests that diplacone binds to the same substrate - binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 92}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
