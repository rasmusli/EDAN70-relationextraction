The transfected DNAs coded the HIV - 1 Gag - Pol plus non - structural viral proteins , the indicated envelope , as well as a miniviral genome bearing a GFP expression cassette , except where a complete provirus was used , as indicated . Two days after transfection , supernatants were pre - cleared by centrifugation at low speed , then by filtration through a 0 , 45 \u03bcm syringe filter and were lastly purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion . Under these conditions , expression of IFITMs induced only a minor defect of virus production , as quantified by exogenous - RT activity ( exo - RT , Additional file 1 : Figure S1A ) . To focus solely on the infectivity defect of retrieved viral particles , virions were normalized by exo - RT and then used to challenge either HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV receptor / co - receptor CD4 / CXCR4 , prior to flow cytometry 3 days afterwards ( a typical FACS profile is presented in Figure 1B ) . Virions produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity over wild type ones ( 70 % to 75 % reduction over a single round infection assay , Figure 1C , left graph ) . To determine whether this defect could be observed using a WT HIV - 1 clone ( NL4 - 3 , a widely used proviral clone ) , the same experimental system was used on viruses produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with NL4 - 3 and IFITMs . Upon exo - RT normalization , virions were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells and viral infectivity was measured by \u03b2 - galactosidase assay ( MAGI ) 24 hours afterwards , taking advantage of the HIV - 1 - LTR - \u03b2 - Gal reporter stably integrated in these cells ( Figure 1C , right graph ) . Under these conditions , IFITMs imparted a similar infectivity defect to produced viruses ( from 70 to 90 % reduction for the different IFITMs ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 386}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 443}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 477}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1160, "end": 1172}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1321, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1685, "end": 1693}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1697, "end": 1704}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1711, "end": 1720}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1818, "end": 1836}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1897, "end": 1930}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 2018, "end": 2025}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
