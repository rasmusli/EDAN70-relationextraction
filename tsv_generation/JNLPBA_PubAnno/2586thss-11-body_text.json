To assess the sensitivity of the HCV strip , a panel of 23 standard positive sera were simultaneously measured by the ELISA , DAS - LFIA , I - LFIA and RT - PCR methods . In addition , serial dilutions of a reference panel with known amounts of anti - HCV antibodies with a concentration from 8 NCU / ml ( NCU meaning national clinical unit ) to 0 . 5 NCU / ml were measured by the DAS - LFIA strip . To assess the specificity and accuracy the ddH 2 0 , positive enhancement sample ( a set of quality control references for anti - HCV antibody detection that contains known amounts of anti - HCV antibodies ; Artron BioResearch Inc . ) , BS control and 8 HCV - negative patients were analyzed by the DAS - LFIA strip .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 201}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 212}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 649, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
