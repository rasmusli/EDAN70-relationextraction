{"cord_uid": "nomfciyu", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC7080179", "divid": "2", "text": "The first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) was identified in the year 2012 , which spread rapidly and increased to more than 2200 in 2018 . This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns . Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of MERS - CoV cases , and currently , no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment . A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus , its structure , route of transmission and its pathophysiology . Therefore , this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS - CoV ' s pathogenesis , treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments , and the major steps taken for MERS prevention control . Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses , and while most of these infect animals , particularly bats , a minor number can also cause human diseases [ 16 ] . Human coronaviruses can be broadly divided into types , \u03b1 and \u03b2 coronavirus [ 17 ] . MERS - CoV is from the \u03b2 - coronavirus family [ 18 ] . It has four major surface proteins that help the virus to enter the cells viz . envelope protein ( E ) , spike ( S ) protein , nucleocapsid ( N ) protein and membrane ( M ) protein . The spike ( S ) protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein made up of S1 and S2 subunits . The S protein is crucial for virus entry through binding and fusion to host cells . The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain ( RBD ) that binds with the DPP4 receptor of the host [ 18 , 19 ] . The S2 subunit contains heptad repeats H1 and H2 which forms the main membrane fusion unit [ 20 ] . The E protein is required for assembly , intracellular transport and budding of virus [ 21 ] . The M protein has its role in viral morphogenesis and assembly [ 22 ] . N proteins and S , E and M proteins interact to form complete virus particles [ 23 ] . In addition to these structural proteins , MERS - CoV has two large polyproteins called pp1a and pp1ab . These proteins are broken down by proteases to form various nonstructural essential proteins , such as enzymes [ 24 , 25 ] . Recent studies have revealed that these viral structural and nonstructural proteins can be exploited as novel targets for therapeutic purposes [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1234, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1253, "end": 1255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1281, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1312, "end": 1335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1341, "end": 1361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1366, "end": 1393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1404, "end": 1423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1429, "end": 1439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1513, "end": 1524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1530, "end": 1554}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1556, "end": 1560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1582, "end": 1596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1626, "end": 1637}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1668, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1692, "end": 1713}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1726, "end": 1736}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1821, "end": 1831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1889, "end": 1900}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1904, "end": 1906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1914, "end": 1925}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1997, "end": 2017}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 2044, "end": 2057}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 2064, "end": 2069}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 2073, "end": 2079}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 2115, "end": 2125}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2141, "end": 2174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2184, "end": 2192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 2246, "end": 2263}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
