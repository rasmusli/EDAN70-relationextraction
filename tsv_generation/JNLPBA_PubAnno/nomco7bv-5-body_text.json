RTIs are divided into upper RTIs ( URTIs ) including common cold , pharyngitis , otitis , sinusitis , laryngotracheitis , epiglottitis and lower RTIs ( LRTIs ) including bronchitis , pneumonia and bronchiolitis [ 3 ] . Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [ 4 , 5 ] and vitamin D status [ 6 , 7 ] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk . In addition , the role of overweight ( body mass index ( BMI ) = 25 . 0 - 29 . 9 kg / m 2 ) and in particular obesity ( BMI \u2265 30 kg / m 2 ) in predisposition to RTIs is increasingly discussed [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide [ 14 ] and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity [ 15 ] . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes . Thus , obesity was associated with non - allergic rhinitis [ 8 ] and influenza like - illness [ 9 ] . Moreover , two population - based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [ 10 , 11 ] . Two recent Danish population - based studies reported an excess of a large spectrum of RTIs including pneumonia among obese people [ 12 , 13 ] . The overall aim of our study targeting the adult population in South Baden , Germany , is to identify risk factors for the susceptibility to RTIs . Here we present data on the role of obesity as contributing factor to a high RTI burden in the German society and explore effect modification by gender , sports activity and nutritional patterns .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
