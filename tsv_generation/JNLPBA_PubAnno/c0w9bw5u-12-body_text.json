The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect . As described above , RIG - I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles ( 1 \u03bcL / mL ) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual - luciferase reporter assay . Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates ( n = 3 ) and error bars indicate their s . d . The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two - tailed Student ' s t - test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P - value ( P ) was indicated . Figure 3A ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) . A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG - I to the IRF3 and NF - \u03baB pathways . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used , greater inhibitory effects were observed , as in the cases of TBK1 ( Figure 3C ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) and IKK - \u03b5 ( Figure 3D ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Surprisingly , when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor ( IRF3 5D ) , with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser / Thr residues mutated to Asp , 52 was employed , the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3 - induced activation of IFN - \u03b2 promoter ( Figure 3E ) , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 58}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 201}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 436}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 550}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 950}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1048}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1103, "end": 1108}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1192, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1279, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1335, "end": 1343}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1402, "end": 1410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1449}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1553, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1581, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1613, "end": 1635}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1714, "end": 1724}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1747, "end": 1752}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1776, "end": 1793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1850, "end": 1860}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1879, "end": 1884}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
