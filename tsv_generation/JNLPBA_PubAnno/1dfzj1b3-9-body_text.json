Nevertheless , their overproduction may be responsible for damage at inflammatory sites . In addition these reactive species play important roles in inflammation by being trigger elements or by being signalling messenger molecules . ROS and RNS act as modulators of protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases , membrane receptors , ion channels , and transcription factors , including nuclear factor - \u03baB ( NF - \u03baB ) , which regulate the expression of key cytokines [ 22 ] . This short review reports the potential of essential oils as antioxidants and antiinflammatory agents , as well as the in vitro mechanisms involved in such properties .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 386}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 447}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 570}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 621}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
