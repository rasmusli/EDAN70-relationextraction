We refer to a secondary structure with crossing base pairs as a pseudoknotted secondary structure and a secondary structure with no crossing base pairs as a pseudoknot - free secondary structure ( see Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 shows different kinds of loops in a secondary structure . We refer the readers to Jabbari et al . [ 48 ] or Rastegari et al .

Examples of loops and canonical base pairs in a pseudoknotted and a pseudoknot - free secondary structure .
