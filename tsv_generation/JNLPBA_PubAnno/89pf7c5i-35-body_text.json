A semiquantitative estimation of amastigotes was also performed with the aid of immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) [ 68 ] , in which the parasitic load of the skin ranged from high ( > 50 immunolabelled amastigotes / field at x400 ) to moderate ( 10 - 50 immunolabelled amastigotes / field ) in cases of diffuse granulomatous dermatitis [ 68 ] . Conversely , it was low ( 1 - 9 immunolabelled amastigotes / field ) in cases of granulomatous perifolliculitis or lichenoid interface dermatitis [ 68 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
