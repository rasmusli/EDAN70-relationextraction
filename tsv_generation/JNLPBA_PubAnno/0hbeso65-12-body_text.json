Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and human herpes virus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation . They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [ 27 , 28 ] . Recently , a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients ( donor or recipient CMV seropositive ) transplanted for HCV was performed to evaluate the associations of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT . It was found that CMV infection was associated with increased risk of fibrosis stage [UNK] 2 and inflammation grade [UNK] 2 [ 29 ] . However , their effects on posttransplant HCV recurrence still remain questionable . Data showed that short - term CMV viremia does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [ 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
