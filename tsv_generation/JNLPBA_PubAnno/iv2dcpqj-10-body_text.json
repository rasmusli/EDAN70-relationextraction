The N pro expression in the CSFV - infected PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells was decreased at 48 and 72 h post - infection ( hpi ) , compared with that in the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3A , B ) . Real - time RT - PCR analysis revealed that the viral genome copies in the PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi , compared with the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3C ) . Additionally , yields of infectious virus in culture supernatant of PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were decreased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 3D ) . The results indicated the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 157}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 808}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
