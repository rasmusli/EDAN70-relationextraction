{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "17", "text": "Our finding that macrodomains encoded by macro - PARP genes have evolved under positive selection motivated us to investigate whether equivalent residues were rapidly evolving in each macrodomain . Such a conserved pattern could suggest that related genetic conflicts ( for example , similar viral pathogens ) drove their evolution . Instead , we observed that a different set of residues is rapidly evolving in each macro domain at a primary sequence level ( Figure 3C , Tables S6 - S8 and Alignment S3 ) . While equivalent amino acids are not evolving in all macro - PARPs , it is possible that positive selection has acted on a single threedimensional protein surface . We therefore modeled the positively selected residues from PARP9 and PARP14 macrodomains onto a structure that has been determined for the first macrodomain of PARP14 [ 48 ] . We found that positively selected residues map to a single surface of each macrodomain , but that each macrodomain shows positive selection on a distinct surface ( Figure 3D ) . As each positively - selected surface is distinct relative to the site of ADPribose binding , these results suggest that ADP - ribose binding is not being altered or optimized by positive selection of the macrodomains . Instead , our findings suggest that each macrodomain has engaged in its own evolutionary arms race with as - yet - unidentified pathogen factors ( see Discussion ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 30}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 60}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 430}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 738}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 749, "end": 762}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 830}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 936}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 964}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1245}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1351, "end": 1392}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
