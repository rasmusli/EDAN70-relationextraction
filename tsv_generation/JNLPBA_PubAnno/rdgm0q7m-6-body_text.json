In mammalian cells , two PCBP subsets have been described , hnRNPs K / J ( 21 ) and the [UNK] CP proteins [UNK] CP1 and [UNK] CP2 , often referred to as PCBP1 and PCBP2 ( 22 , 23 ) . The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues PCBP3 and PCBP4 ( 24 ) . PCBPs are members of the KH domain superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins and have a wide spectrum of biological activities , including the regulation of RNA splicing , the stabilization of cellular and viral mRNAs , transcriptional activation and inhibition , and translational silencing and enhancement ( reviewed in Refs . 25 , 26 ) . Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays , we demonstrate that a complex of nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP binds to the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence and mimics the action of the more typical RNA pseudoknot stimulators of programmed frameshifting . This unprecedented frameshift - stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by trans - acting protein factors . Further , it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly ( C ) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 401}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 501}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 567}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 741}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 954}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 964, "end": 969}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1091}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1254, "end": 1285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1354, "end": 1382}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
