Copy number detection was measured by serial dilutions of known amounts of DNA containing the target sequences , either as genomic or plasmid DNA ( Figure 3 ) . Reactions fail in both assays at DNA molecule number of less than 1 which is consistent with the stochastic probability of a target being present [ 7 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
