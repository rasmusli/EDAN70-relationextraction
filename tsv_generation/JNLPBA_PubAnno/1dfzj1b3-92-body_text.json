The mixture of stereoisomers geranial ( E - isomer ) and neral ( Z - isomer ) , known as citral , constitutes the main components of Cymbopogon citratus ( DC ) Stapf . ( lemongrass ) essential oil . This essential oil revealed to be capable to suppress IL - 1\u03b2 and IL - 6 in LPS - stimulated peritoneal macrophages of normal mice [ 117 ] . The same authors attributed similar properties to the eugenol , the main component present in the essential oil of Syzygium aromaticum ( L . ) Merr . et Perry ( clove ) [ 118 ] . Other authors also found that eugenol on human macrophages ( U937 ) under the stimulation of LPS blocked the release of IL - 1\u03b2 , TNF - \u03b1 and PGE 2 [ 119 ] . Whether some essential oils are able to inhibit the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines such as TNF - \u03b1 , some of them , particularly lemongrass , geranium and spearmint and their main components ( citral , geraniol , citronellol , and carvone ) , can also suppress TNF - \u03b1 - induced neutrophil adherence responses [ 120 ] . According to these authors , those essential oils or their major components do not affect TNF - \u03b1 but do affect the neutrophil function to suppress their adhesion . Therefore and concerning lemongrass and citral and as reported above , they can also suppress IL - 1\u03b2 and IL - 6 pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 117 ] . In other work , Lin et al . ( 2008 ) [ 121 ] Therefore , the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be , at least in part , due to the inhibition of TNF - \u03b1 release from macrophages , according to the same authors [ 122 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 146, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 869}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 879}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 994}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1321, "end": 1329}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1490, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1509, "end": 1538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1704, "end": 1712}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
