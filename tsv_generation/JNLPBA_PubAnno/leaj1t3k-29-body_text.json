They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs . Surprisingly , unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate . In vi vo antiviral activity of PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 90}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 501}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 561}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 569}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
