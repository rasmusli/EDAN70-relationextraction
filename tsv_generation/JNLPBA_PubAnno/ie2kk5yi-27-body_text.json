For swab samples that were also assessed by PCR in blood ( n = 15 for saliva , n = 28 for feces ) , both corresponding positive saliva samples were positive in blood ; most positive fecal samples were also PCR positive in blood , although one fecal - positive sample was PCR negative in blood ( S4 Fig ) . For our random subset of sequenced positive saliva ( n = 4 ) and fecal ( n = 5 ) samples , phylogenetic analyses suggested that all sequences shared a minimum of 97 % identity to one or more of our 35 blood - derived Bartonella sequences ( S5 Table , Fig 6 ) . In many cases , saliva and fecal sequences were the same genotype as blood sequences derived from the same geographic region ( e . g . , the saliva sequence from D234 shared > 96 % identity to the blood sequence from D98 , both from AM1 ) . For the one case in which we sequenced positive samples from the same individual bat ( i . e . , D203 ) , both the blood sequence and fecal sequence shared 100 % identity ( S5 Table , Fig 6 ) . For the few sequences at the lower range of our similarity spectrum , BLAST still demonstrated that the closest relatives were all derived from vampire bats ( i . e . , 8368 from CA1 was identical to MF467797 from Mexico ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 688}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 775, "end": 781}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 863}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 918}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1077}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1320, "end": 1324}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
