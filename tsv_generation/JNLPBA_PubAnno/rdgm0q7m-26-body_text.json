In RNA structuredependent PRF , interaction of the stimulatory RNA with the ribosome impairs movement of the small subunit head during translocation , destabilizing the hybrid state and elevating energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) . Completion of translocation is accelerated by slippage of tRNAs into the \u2212 1 frame , thus promoting PRF . At the PRRSV signal , the bound nsp1 [UNK] - PCBP complex would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the slippery sequence , facilitating interactions between them . In this light , it may be significant that in pull down assays , nsp1 [UNK] has been shown to interact with rpS14 ( 34 ) , a protein immediately adjacent to a component ( rpS3 ) of the putative ribosome - associated mRNA unwinding activity ( 13 ) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1 ( 41 ) , a ribosome - associated protein located close to the mRNA entry channel . Details of the molecular interactions that take place upon encounter of elongating ribosomes remain to be determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 275}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 307}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 344}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 817}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 936}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 968, "end": 981}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1036}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1111, "end": 1117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1143, "end": 1149}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1160, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1216}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
