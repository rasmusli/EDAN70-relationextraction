{"cord_uid": "1qgpa45q", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6941262", "divid": "21", "text": "All human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) full genome sequences were retrieved from GenBank ( January 2018 ) using the query ( txid162145 ( Organism ) AND 12000 ( SLEN ) : 14000 ( SLEN ) NOT patent ) . Sequence entries with gaps larger than 6 nt were excluded to generate a set of yielding 178 genomes . All possible 23 nt sequences were generated from the genomes dataset and trimmed to a final calculated melting temperature ( Tm ) of 47 . 9 - 49 . 5 \u00b0 C . Sequences with homology to rRNA sequences , with GC content outside < 0 . 3 or > 0 . 75 or with a single nucleotide fractional content of > 0 . 6 were discarded . The primer set was then made nonredundant yielding 60 , 746 potential primers . All potential primers were mapped against the 178 HMPV full genomes and the number of perfect matches ( frequency score ) was determined as a measure of primer sequence conservation . To select primers , the HMPV genome sequences were divided into amplicons with 222 nt overlap spanning the virus genome . Potential primers that mapped within the terminal 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 222 nt of each amplicon were identified and the sequence with the highest frequency score was selected , and primers mapping to the reverse bins were reverse complemented . In this manner , 24 primers were selected for each of the 4 HMPV genotype representative genomes ( GenBank accession number HMPV A1 : AF371337 , HMPV A2 : FJ168779 ; HMPV B1 : AY525843 , and HMPV B2 : FJ168778 ) . Because of conservation between genotypes , there was primer redundancy which was removed . The final set of 65 primer sequences , their lengths , calculated Tm , fractional GC content and mapping position on the HMPV genome are presented in Additional file 5 : Table S2 . The primers were computationally tested against each of the 4 HMPV subgroups . A graphical representation of the primer target sites is presented in Additional file 1 : Figure S1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 763}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 925}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 973}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1559, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1663, "end": 1675}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1836, "end": 1856}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
