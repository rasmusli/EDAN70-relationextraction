To directly measure viral protease activity in cells , we generated a proteasesensitive dual luciferase reporter system . In this split luciferase system , cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity , which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control . This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion .
