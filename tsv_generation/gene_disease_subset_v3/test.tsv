13	Concerning the cat , specifically synthesized @GENE$ molecules were recently shown to induce @GENE$ [ 34 ] ; @GENE$ molecules indicated the capability to induce proliferation of feline cells [ 35 ] , and @GENE$ - adjuvanted allergen indicated potential for immunotherapy in a feline @DISEASE$ model [ 36 ]	1
14	Evolutionary analyses of @GENE$ increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of @DISEASE$ viruses , but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility , mainly because no statistical framework exists within which @GENE$ and empirical data on host movement can be combined	1
15	In conclusion , the global dynamics of @DISEASE$ are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled @GENE$	1
16	@DISEASE$ is usually associated with the proliferation of one or more strains of β - hemolytic ETEC in the small intestine of pigs , in particular those that express fimbrial adhesins @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or @GENE$ [ 2 ]	1
17	Thus , small intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC is mediated by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ or @GENE$ ) , the existence and function of which are crucial in determining the susceptibility of pigs to @DISEASE$ [ 2 , 7 ]	1
18	Irrespective of the overall common suppressive action in draining LN during @DISEASE$ , the function of endogenous @GENE$ + Treg migrating to and residing in the CNS throughout persistence remains obscure	1
19	Regulation of the CNS autoimmune responses by @GENE$ Tregs is also ineffective during @DISEASE$ ( 48 )	1
20	Expression of both cytokines during @DISEASE$ infection ( 49 ) suggests they may have similar suppressive activity on local @GENE$ + Treg	1
21	Alternatively , a potential deficit of @GENE$ access to @DISEASE$ , with perivascular retention , may explain their inability to regulate @DISEASE$ and will require further investigation	1
22	It is also possible that residual @GENE$ detected 1 week after DT treatment may be sufficient to control @DISEASE$	1
23	While rebound Tregs are dysfunctional ( 28 ) , @GENE$ have been shown to protect against lethal @DISEASE$ and may thus suffice to control the SR CD4 + T cells during @DISEASE$ ( 23 )	1
24	In contrast to the lack of @GENE$ + Treg suppressive function within the CNS , @GENE$ − / − mice displayed increased virus and SR CD4 + T cell responses , implicating Tr1 cells as a major regulator of @DISEASE$ during @DISEASE$	1
25	As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens , @GENE$ activation is required for resistance to a variety of @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
26	However , many viruses such as @DISEASE$ , exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through @GENE$ located in their @GENE$ [ 2 ]	1
27	On the contrary , many pathogens such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] have developed strategies to interfere with host @GENE$ responses	1
28	@GENE$ are particularly interesting as these are seen in other disorders , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 122 ]	1
29	Other @DISEASE$ have also been associated with @GENE$	1

31	In the present study , the levels of @GENE$ decreased in the progression of @DISEASE$ from @DISEASE$ to @DISEASE$	1

37	Figure 8A shows that @GENE$ was detected in the muscle and brain of @DISEASE$ , STG69 , and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms	1
38	Immunohistochemical analysis with an @GENE$ supported the viral gene expression data ; only @DISEASE$ mice with a high infection rate had Purkinje layer cells from the brain that stained dark brown after diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) staining ( Figure 8B ) .	1
39	@GENE$ infiltrate the CNS during acute @DISEASE$ and are retained together with both virus - specific and SR T cells during persistence ( 13 , 19 )	1
40	To specifically investigate a function of @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ persistence , we infected DEREG mice , in which DT treatment abrogated the vast majority of @GENE$ under homeostatic conditions but retained a minor fraction thereby circumventing @DISEASE$ ( 22 )	1
41	In other work , it has been suggested that whilst endogenous @GENE$ could co - localise with @DISEASE$ RTCs , @GENE$ showed significantly reduced co - localisation [ 56 ]	1
42	To identify the key molecules and signaling pathways that may mediate the inhibition of cell entry into S phase by EV - D68 , we examined the protein expression profiles of host @GENE$ and @GENE$ by Western blotting of @DISEASE$ cells at 0 , 16 , 20 , 24 , and 28 h post - infection	1
43	Just as stimulated PBMCs exhibited high mRNA expression of @GENE$ and only a marginal increase in mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines @GENE$ and @GENE$ , treated cats showed significantly increased @GENE$ expression in their blood and lacked @DISEASE$ generally linked with administration of immunostimulatory molecules in vivo	1
44	We also investigated innate immune responses induced by @DISEASE$ infection of porcine NEC , and our data indicate a mild and delayed induction of the proinflammatory cytokines @GENE$ and @GENE$ and undetectable levels of other @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ , contrasting with the @GENE$ responses induced by common @DISEASE$ ( 58 ) ( 59 ) ( 60 )	1
45	This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on @DISEASE$ and by the observed induction of @GENE$ , a potent negative regulator of the @GENE$ pathway and consequently also of the expression of @GENE$ ( 61 )	1
46	This is in accordance with a report describing @GENE$ induction during @DISEASE$ infection ( 36 ) .	1
47	Immune responses and protection against @DISEASE$ in mice lacking the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) following immunisation with the @GENE$ vaccine Mechanisms of ZIKV - induced disease and immunity are poorly defined , and the protective versus the hypothetical pathogenic nature of the immune response to @DISEASE$ is as yet unclear	1
48	17 Most strains of mice are resistant to @DISEASE$ , however , mice lacking @GENE$ ( @GENE$ − / − ) were found to be susceptible to infection and disease with most succumbing within 6 - 7 days post challenge	1
49	The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ on @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive / negative and retaining the same contrasts	1

52	Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in @DISEASE$ epithelial cells and that @GENE$ may be effective in cell repair after injury 18 , 55 , 56	1
53	Little is known about the role of the TLR7 / 8 @GENE$ pathway in @DISEASE$ ; however , @GENE$ was shown to suppress LGTV replication within neurons of the brain although it did not affect pathogenesis [ 132 ]	1
54	What we are aware of ; no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3 @GENE$ pathway in @DISEASE$	1
55	However , several studies have looked at the prevalence of polymorphisms in the @GENE$ gene in @DISEASE$ patients [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ]	1
56	hypothesized that a functional @GENE$ facilitates the onset of @DISEASE$ [ 135 ] by supporting the penetration through the blood brain barrier , but has a protective effect during the established @DISEASE$ [ 134 ]	1
57	Diagnostic performances of BAL fluid cellular components , @GENE$ concentration , and @GENE$ concentration for the prediction of @DISEASE$ 	1
58	Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to @DISEASE$ as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by @GENE$ nor did @GENE$ interact with @GENE$ of WNV [ 147 ] .	1
59	@GENE$ that are involved in viral defence or apoptosis and are related to @DISEASE$ may be useful for studying anti - viral and oncolytic therapy	1
60	@GENE$ contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , particularly in early @DISEASE$ ( 21 )	1
61	However , no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful results for the analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 viruses in particular and @DISEASE$ viruses in general .	1
62	The overall codon usage among 48 @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ was analyzed in this study	1
63	Studies currently ongoing on peripheral @GENE$ profiles , B cells and PBs may show a consistent marker to help define who has @DISEASE$	1
64	She was also screened for antigen detection of adenovirus and rotavirus , and serological assays targeting @GENE$ for @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ were performed	1
65	The nsp2 @GENE$ signal of @DISEASE$ is distinctive in directing both − 2 and − 1 @GENE$ and in its requirement for a @GENE$ , the viral replicase subunit @GENE$	1
66	Cross - reactions exist between @GENE$ to different @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ species as also shown in dogs , but they do not seem to occur with @GENE$ to T	1
67	To assess the effects of PAB on @GENE$ and virulence , @DISEASE$ cells were infected with EV - D68 US / KY / 14 - 18953 strain or EV - A71 at an MOI of 0	1
68	To overcome the problem of immune tolerance in mouse models of HCV expression , we developed an HCV model in mice that relies on conditional expression of the @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ and the Cre / loxP switching system [ 5 , 6 ] ; we showed that the injection of an Ad - Cre vector enhanced the frequency of HCV - specific activated CD8 T cells in the liver of these mice and caused @DISEASE$	1
69	Therefore , this Ad - @GENE$ - dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to @DISEASE$ .	1
70	@GENE$ and @GENE$ have also been implicated in the recognition of the @DISEASE$ virus [ 28 , 29 ]	1
71	These findings indicate that @GENE$ on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV - N25 in our model of @DISEASE$ infection ; however , further examination of this hypothesis is required	1
72	The finding that pathological symptoms in the @DISEASE$ transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of @GENE$ and @GENE$ indicated that the progression of @DISEASE$ depended on @GENE$ in serum , rather than the @GENE$ otein levels in hepatocytes	1
73	Lymphocytes , macrophages , hepatocytes , and adipocytes each produce @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 30 , 31 ] , and @DISEASE$ - infected patients have elevated levels of @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 32 , 33 ]	1
74	Both @GENE$ also contribute to the maintenance of @DISEASE$ in mice fed a high - fat diet [ 34 ] , and production of @GENE$ and @GENE$ is elevated in @DISEASE$ mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [ 35 ]	1
75	These findings indicate that both @GENE$ are responsible for HCV - triggered @DISEASE$ , and anti - @GENE$ neutralization is a potential treatment for @DISEASE$ if antiviral therapy is not successful .	1
76	We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H 2 attenuates @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , including induced @GENE$ and microglial activation , in the fetal brain	1
77	While neither CNS antiviral function nor @DISEASE$ were affected by @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion , a potential increase in virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells may be unapparent due to their low frequencies in the CNS	1
78	These data were consistent with similar @DISEASE$ and supported a limited role for @GENE$ in controlling the CNS SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic @DISEASE$ .	1
79	The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes , similar to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) for @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
80	Real - time RT - qPCR using @GENE$ primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 6 hpi showed no significant effect of MG132 treatment , indicating that the @GENE$ does not play a role during @DISEASE$ entry to Culex cells ( Fig 2C )	1
81	Principal Findings : A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is @GENE$ , a @GENE$ strongly induced by @DISEASE$ infection	1
82	In bank voles , offspring of @DISEASE$ - infected dams were less likely to be infected after exiting the nest because of protective @GENE$ [ 30 ]	1
83	@GENE$ antagonism limits local restimulation of antiviral CD8 + T cells during @DISEASE$ 	1
84	The specimens were examined for @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , @DISEASE$ type A ( InfA ) and B ( InfB ) , @DISEASE$ types 1 , 2 and 3 ( PIV1 , PIV2 , and PIV3 ) , and human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) using a multiplex @GENE$ polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay .	1
85	Using the @GENE$ , we next sought to create true inhibitors of @DISEASE$ that were not cleavable substrates and with the potential proteolytic stability required for in vivo studies	1
86	However , some cell types being refractory to lipofectamine transfection which can moreover be toxic in vivo , CPP - mediated delivery of @GENE$ is definitely worth investigating in other cell types and in animal models of @DISEASE$ .	1
87	16 As shown in Figure 3e , ZIKV - @GENE$ vaccination yielded significant neutralisation response with anti - ZIKV reciprocal @GENE$ 50 dilution titres ( inverse of the serum dilution at which 50 % of the control @DISEASE$ infection was inhibited ) of 456 ± 5 , whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV - Cap DNA vaccine immunized mice was 33 ± 6 which was minimally higher than that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals ( titre = 15 ± 2 ) .	1
88	Amongst the differentially expressed genes in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , @GENE$ was highly up - regulated ( > 20 - fold in RNA - Seq and > 12 - fold in real - time RT - qPCR ) following @DISEASE$ infection in Culex cells ( Fig 1B and S2 Table )	1
89	@GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , have been found to be upregulated during @DISEASE$ infection of mammalian cells and implicated in various cellular processes such cell cycle regulation , signal transduction , DNA replication as well as viral replication [ 33 ]	1
90	Early studies [ 47 , 48 ] suggested that @GENE$ had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ because it was highly expressed in 31 - 50 % of patients with @DISEASE$ , and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium	1
91	One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant - negative c - Jun mutant @GENE$ in lung epithelial cells decreased @DISEASE$ number and overall @DISEASE$ burden in chemically induced mouse @DISEASE$ models [ 49 ]	1
92	Notably , expression of @GENE$ is sufficient to restore @DISEASE$ growth after @GENE$ knockdown in @DISEASE$ cells , suggesting that @GENE$ is an important mediator of @GENE$ oncogenic activities [ 50 ]	1
93	@GENE$ is another protein that commonly features in studies on @DISEASE$	1
94	Immunoblotting data identified increases in @GENE$ levels in @DISEASE$ , and @GENE$ immunoreactivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix , irrespective of the apparent reduction in @GENE$	1
95	@GENE$ immunoreactivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of @DISEASE$ , particularly for @DISEASE$ , paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa ( 22 )	1
96	These results suggest that @GENE$ may be important in the progression of @DISEASE$ and / or in @DISEASE$ through its @GENE$ , and that @GENE$ levels are likely to be higher in patients with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ than in controls ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 )	1
97	In the present study , @GENE$ levels decreased in the progression of @DISEASE$ ( from @DISEASE$ to HBV - induced @DISEASE$ )	1
98	In one of these studies , it was demonstrated that , in @DISEASE$ , the concentration of plasma @GENE$ was significantly lower than in healthy controls and was associated with the severity of @DISEASE$	1
99	Notably , levels of @GENE$ in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with @DISEASE$ compared with those in normal controls	1
100	In the other study , it was demonstrated that there were lower levels of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ , which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis , deposition in injured tissues or a combination of the two ( 25 )	1
101	The development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant @GENE$ antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the @DISEASE$	1
102	Following @DISEASE$ , T cell migration to the CNS is regulated by @GENE$ , as well as @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 33 ) ( 34 ) ( 35 )	1
103	Overall , these results indicate that @GENE$ mediate suppressive function primarily within CLN and are more potent at controlling peripheral SR T cell activation than virus - specific T cells during @DISEASE$	1
104	reduced Tr1 cell response correlates with increased cns sr T cells Unaltered SR T cell responses within the CNS of DT - treated DTR + mice indicated a @GENE$ - independent component regulating the CNS autoimmune response during @DISEASE$	1
105	In addition to @GENE$ , IL - 10 - producing Tr1 cells also regulate autoimmune responses , including during @DISEASE$ ( 40 , 41 )	1
106	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotype ( sequencing of the @GENE$ after polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] screening ) of HAdVs among children with @DISEASE$ in different areas of China from 2007 to 2010	1
107	In bats the evolutionary suppression of inflammation and consequent susceptibility to @DISEASE$ infection is counteracted by constitutive expression of @GENE$ or @GENE$ to target viruses as described earlier	1
108	EV - D68 belong to @DISEASE$ ( family Picornaviridae , genus Enterovirus ) , which are non - enveloped , positive - sense singlestrand RNA viruses of approximately 7500 nt and contain a large @GENE$ that encodes a @GENE$ that is cleaved to yield corresponding @GENE$	1
109	Therefore , we suggest that exclusion of the @GENE$ as immunogen is one important factor in @DISEASE$ vaccine design .	1
110	Here , we used @GENE$ - induced expression of @GENE$ to generate HCV transgenic mice in order to study the effect of @GENE$ and confirmed that these mice developed @DISEASE$ - including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
111	However , experimental results obtained with this mouse model may not directly translate to clinical findings from patients with @DISEASE$ because the expression of @GENE$ was not liver specific in these mice	1
112	Furthermore , @GENE$ injection can activate innate immune responses and , consequently , might induce temporary @DISEASE$ [ 18 ]	1
113	They successfully suppressed @DISEASE$ infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these @GENE$ , inhibiting HIV - 1 entry into target cells and its replication .	1
114	Different groups of viruses , such as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( HIV - 1 ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , utilize @GENE$ as cofactor for viral transcription , translation and assembly	1
115	Considering CSFV , @DISEASE$ , HCV and @DISEASE$ are all Flaviviridae members , we suppose that the @GENE$ possibly interacts with @GENE$ or affects the CSFV growth in host cells	1
116	The outcome of @DISEASE$ infections is determined by the repertoire and specificity of the @GENE$ in a particular animal species	1
117	Epitope spreading , molecular mimicry , @GENE$ , and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self - reactive ( SR ) immune cells , ultimately leading to organ - specific @DISEASE$	1
118	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were more divergent between the @DISEASE$ subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63 % identity , respectively	1
119	Early data , examining the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ recipients with @DISEASE$ , first reported that methylprednisolone treatment for @DISEASE$ led to a 4 - 100 - fold increase in @GENE$ [ 31 ]	1
120	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ - α ( @GENE$ ) are two important @GENE$ with a relevant role in the @DISEASE$	1
121	The presence of @GENE$ in the strip may be crucial for the detection of @DISEASE$ infected patients with low antibody titers .	1
122	In deer mice infected with @DISEASE$ , early expression signatures of a mixed Th1 / Th2 / Treg response were present in virus - specific CD4 + T cells , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , before transitioning to a Treg - like response at persistence [ 54 ]	1
123	@GENE$ is highly conserved in evolution and was first identified as an @GENE$ with antiviral activity against human @DISEASE$ in 2001 [ 157 ]	1
124	Within the family of flaviviridae , @GENE$ has been shown to inhibit several members , such as WNV [ 160 ] , DENV [ 161 ] , ZIKV [ 162 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 163 ] , and TBEV [ 86 , 141 , 149 , 150 ]	1
125	In @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ induction has been shown to correlate with amount of @GENE$ , and the @GENE$ pathway has been shown to protect mice from lethal @DISEASE$ and prolong survival after @DISEASE$ [ 80 , 128 ]	1
126	Furthermore , @GENE$ induction was shown to be completely dependent on @GENE$ and @GENE$ in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and viral recognition through the @GENE$ - pathway was shown to be dependent on @GENE$ and not @GENE$ in human @DISEASE$ cells ( U2OS ) [ 80 , 83 ]	1
127	Interestingly , @GENE$ has been shown to co - localize with @GENE$ ( SG ) during @DISEASE$ infection [ 129 ]	1
128	@GENE$ are induced during @DISEASE$ infection and @GENE$ components @GENE$ was found to bind @GENE$ and inhibit viral translation [ 131 ] .	1
129	HeLa TZM - bl indicator cells were seeded in 96 - well plates in duplicates ( 4000 cells / well ) and infected the next day with 1 ng @DISEASE$ virus - glycoprotein ( VSV - G ) - pseudotyped virions standardized for @GENE$ content by ELISA ( Aalto Bio Reagents )	1
130	To obtain the @GENE$ , the sequences encoding the desired A novel double antibody sandwich - lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid and simple detection of @DISEASE$ virus regions in the @GENE$ were amplified by RT - PCR , and cloned into the @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , @GENE$ ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) , or @GENE$ ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Chalfont St	1
131	A partial @GENE$ was amplified by PCR to screen and type @DISEASE$ as previously described [ 16 , 23 ]	1
132	Nine of ten ( 90 % ) @DISEASE$ isolates were @GENE$ negative and susceptible to ampicillin ( MIC ≤ 1μg / ml ) and cefuroxime ( MIC ≤ 1μg / ml ) [ 16 ]	1
133	Experiments were performed to determine whether @DISEASE$ infection leads to @GENE$ degradation via @GENE$	1
134	Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$ and infected with @DISEASE$ at 24 h post - transfection	1
135	The results ( Fig 5C ) showed cells infected with @DISEASE$ showed decreased @GENE$ levels , which returned to baseline in cells transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
136	Although , we cannot rule out the possibility that reduced degradation of @GENE$ upon @GENE$ knockdown is due to lower virus replication , these results combined with other data indicate that @DISEASE$ infection leads to degradation of @GENE$ via @GENE$ .	1
137	The pBR322 - based plasmid vector @GENE$ contained the @GENE$ within the @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ virus , which was reconstructed from the @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 41 , 42 ]	1
138	Clinical cases of @DISEASE$ with positive sera have specific @GENE$ against @GENE$ of low molecular mass ( ≤ 31 kDa ) [ 12 , 22 ] by WB	1
139	Meanwhile , these results serve as a reminder that different @DISEASE$ may require different therapeutic treatments targeting a different set of @GENE$	1
140	, 2007 ) , and mouse @DISEASE$ virus ( MHV ) ( Chen and Makino , 2004 ) and some @GENE$ ell cycle arrest in G0 / G1 phase ( Yuan et al	1
141	However , STG135 mice were not protected against @DISEASE$ infection even though @GENE$ was expressed in the brain ( Figure 7A ) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice	1
142	First described as the mechanism by which the @GENE$ of the retrovirus @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) is expressed from @GENE$ ( 4 ) , related − 1 @GENE$ signals have been documented in many other viruses of clinical , veterinary and agricultural importance ( reviewed in Ref	1
143	Elevated @GENE$ ( muscle ) , @GENE$ ( brainstem , spinal cord , and muscle ) , and @GENE$ ( brainstem and muscle ) responding to the innate immunity against @DISEASE$ infection were downregulated in transgenic mice that received N3 after infection in contrast to non - treated or isotype antibody - treated mice ( Fig	1
144	Analysis of parvoviral @GENE$ sequence data confirmed that all @DISEASE$ cases were caused by @DISEASE$ and not @DISEASE$	1
145	As a proof of concept , results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 isolates and @DISEASE$ viruses are presented	1
146	To determine whether @GENE$ acts via the proteasomal pathway , Hsu cells were transfected with the @GENE$ and , at 24 h post - transfection , infected with @DISEASE$ and treated simultaneously with either MG132 ( 10 μM ) or the @GENE$ inhibitor PYR - 41 ( 10 μM )	1
147	Real - time RT - qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 hpi showed decreased @GENE$ expression in cells overexpressing @GENE$ compared with control ( empty vector ) cells in @DISEASE$ infected cells	1
148	Real time RT - qPCR using @GENE$ showed increased expression after @DISEASE$ infection which was further increased in cells transfected with @GENE$ ( Fig 4E )	1
149	@GENE$ on the other hand showed increased expression after @DISEASE$ infection with no further increase in cells with @GENE$	1
150	Following the discovery , in the 1980s , of the increased risk of @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$ 37 , models of viral - like immune activation by polyriboinosinic - polyribocytidilic acid ( @GENE$ ) have been widely studied 33 , 38 , 39	1
151	In addition , models of bacterial - like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and @DISEASE$ in offspring , similar to the @GENE$ models 38	1
152	In deer mice infected with @DISEASE$ , early expression signatures of a mixed Th1 / Th2 / Treg response were present in virus - specific CD4 + T cells , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , before transitioning to a Treg - like response at persistence [ 54 ]	1
153	Previous studies have shown that the @GENE$ exhibits anti - tumour activity in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ 13 , 15 , but the complete mechanisms of its anti - cancer activity have not been revealed	1
154	Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples ( particularly from distal antebrachial skin ) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of @GENE$ in both squirrel species , while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate @DISEASE$ infection	1
155	@GENE$ Is Pro - Viral during @DISEASE$ Infection of Culex Mosquitoes	1
156	The @DISEASE$ - like @DISEASE$ were observed in transgenic mice pre - infected with clinical isolates E59 ( genotype B4 of EV71 ) and N2838 ( B5 ) ; severe @DISEASE$ and death in transgenic mice pre - inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 ( C2 ) , N3340 ( @GENE$ ) and coxsackievirus A16 ( CVA16 ) [ 11 ]	1
157	3 % ) [ 13 , 14 ] , @DISEASE$ might be caused by increased @DISEASE$ vascular permeability resulting from @DISEASE$ caused by the excessive release of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ [ 13 , 15 , 16 ]	1
158	When RNA association was examined by EMSA , @GENE$ and @GENE$ bound to the @GENE$ with similar affinity and in an @GENE$ [UNK] - dependent manner , although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the @DISEASE$ proteins	1
159	The gene encoding @GENE$ was introduced into HeLa cells to test whether 3D8 scFv expressing cell lines could protect against @DISEASE$	1
160	Our in vitro results complements previously published in vivo findings , which can explain the high efficiency of @DISEASE$ infection of pigs via the oronasal route and are in line with different experiments which showed oronasal shedding several days beyond the end of viremia , and they additionally can explain the detection of high levels of @GENE$ in nasal mucosa , which can last up to 10 days after challenge ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 )	1
161	Field studies with larger cohorts of animals will provide further insights on the utilization of @GENE$ for the prevention of @DISEASE$ in a clinical setting .	1
162	@DISEASE$ of @DISEASE$ induces @GENE$ mediating monocyte recruitment	1
163	Considering that the establishment of innate immune responses by virus - infected cells may also involve the production of @GENE$ responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection , we measured the gene expression of several @GENE$ in JEV - infected porcine @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
164	A continued research effort to better understand how these @GENE$ interact with the autophagic machinery may provide therapeutic strategies and ultimately lead to the discovery of novel pharmacological agents to fight @DISEASE$ .	1
165	During @DISEASE$ infection , a @GENE$ is formed , called @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 93 , 184 , 185 ]	1
166	Similarly , in @DISEASE$ infection , @GENE$ has been demonstrated to inhibit the antiviral RNAi response in tick cells [ 93 ]	1
167	[ 51 ] were the first to apply @GENE$ to @DISEASE$ genomic data , but they only studied one of the eleven @GENE$ of the @GENE$ and did not analyze changes over time	1
168	Moreover , no assays are in place for detecting @GENE$ , which should be prominent in @DISEASE$	1
169	@GENE$ assays have been problematic despite the availability of anti - @GENE$ capture antisera that are cross - reactive with @GENE$ from at least one @DISEASE$ reservoir species [ 44 ]	1
170	It is likely that reservoirs also have @GENE$ with distinct effector functions and which might predominate during @DISEASE$	1
171	The anti - inflammatory effects of diverse combination of thyme ( p - cymene and thymol as main components ) and oregano ( carvacrol as major component ) oils on mice with @GENE$ ASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ showed that some combinations lowered the amounts of @GENE$ and IL - 6 @GENE$ [ 124 ] .	1
172	Moreover , the recent discovery of the @GENE$ encoding for colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on a @GENE$ has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of @DISEASE$ in humans	1
173	Previous studies have indicated that the specific @GENE$ T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$	1
174	Moreover , plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of @GENE$ against @DISEASE$ infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [ 36 , 37 ]	1
175	The former encodes the @GENE$ that give rise to @DISEASE$ , which is replaced in the latter by the @GENE$ which restores fertility : both also have the selectable marker bar which confers tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium	1
176	Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with @DISEASE$ has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls ( 19 ) and it was indicated that @GENE$ was activated and upregulated in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
177	In the present study , levels of @GENE$ decreased in the progression of @DISEASE$ to @DISEASE$	1
178	This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of @GENE$ as a biomarker in the progression of @DISEASE$ .	1
179	Cellular analysis of BAL fluid , including total and differential cell counts and the @GENE$ + : CD8 + T - lymphocyte ratio , is useful for the diagnosis of various @DISEASE$ [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
180	As @GENE$ are among the regulatory mechanisms dampening @DISEASE$ pathogenesis , their implication in controlling SR CD4 + T cells was of particular interest	1
181	The data herein are novel in demonstrating that @GENE$ + @GENE$ abrogation during persistence preferentially enhanced endogenously primed , peripheral SR CD4 + T cells but had no effect on CNS localized SR T cells or tissue damage during chronic @DISEASE$	1
182	( 20 ) showing that @GENE$ adoptively transferred into acutely @DISEASE$ - infected mice were not detected within the CNS but rather exerted prominent function within CLN by dampening dendritic cell activation , T cell proliferation , and @GENE$ expression	1
183	@GENE$ + @GENE$ dependent downregulation of CLN inflammatory response thus correlated with limited @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ without affecting viral persistence ( 20 )	1
184	Protection against @DISEASE$ and disease in IFNAR − / − mice following ZIKV - @GENE$ immunisation In exploratory studies , 5 - 6 - week - old IFNAR ( − / − ) mice ( n = 10 ) were challenged with 1 × 10 6 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of the ZIKV - PR209 isolate , administered by either subcutaneous ( s	1
185	With regard to this , a @GENE$ arketed in both Japan ( Intercat ® ) and Europe ( Virbagen Omega ® ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for @DISEASE$ and canine @DISEASE$ [ 67 , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of @DISEASE$ [ 87 ]	1
186	In vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of @GENE$ after @DISEASE$ infection , which is able to protect neighboring astrocytes and neurons from infection already 6 and 3 h post infection , respectively [ 100 ]	1
187	Astrocytes have been shown to be resistant to @DISEASE$ - induced cytopathic effects [ 144 , 145 ] , and it was later shown that @GENE$ expression protected the astrocytes from the virus - induced cytopathic effects [ 100 ]	1
188	Pretreatment of cells with @GENE$ strongly inhibits growth of most @DISEASE$ in cell culture [ 100 , 103 , [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] and this is due to the upregulation and concerted actions of several hundreds of @GENE$	1
189	Only a few @GENE$ have been identified to play a role in @DISEASE$ [ 86 , 141 , 147 , 149 , 150 ]	1
190	Several polymorphisms in the @GENE$ have been shown to correlate with severe forms of @DISEASE$ in patients [ 154 ]	1
191	Two other @GENE$ which have been shown to be antivirally active against @DISEASE$ are virus inhibitory protein @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) .	1
192	Mice treated with @GENE$ exhibited visible @DISEASE$ associated with scurfy skin peaked on Day 6 post infection , and the @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ gradually disappeared after Day 7 post infection	1
193	Administration of @GENE$ to E59 - preinfected mice reduced the @DISEASE$ to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards ( Figs	1
194	Moreover , prechallenge of 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu 5746 [ 11 ] caused progressive @DISEASE$ from Day 4 onwards and led to death if the mice remained untreated or @GENE$ treated ( Figs	1
195	Some @DISEASE$ encode a second @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) downstream from the @GENE$ in frame 2 [ 2 , 3 ]	1
196	In sum , our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to @GENE$ function during @DISEASE$ infection	1
197	As @GENE$ is known as an important @GENE$ , these proteins could be related to @DISEASE$ development	1
198	It is frequently up - regulated in @DISEASE$ cells and functions as a master regulator of @GENE$ escape genes in @DISEASE$ 45	1
199	To determine whether @GENE$ plays a similar role during @DISEASE$ infection , Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid expressing @GENE$ and infected with @DISEASE$ 24 h post - transfection	1
200	As expected , expression of both @GENE$ and @GENE$ was upregulated following @DISEASE$ infection	1
201	Antibodies directed against the @GENE$ are thought to play a major role in controlling @DISEASE$ and in mediating vaccine - induced protective immunity	1
202	Conclusions : Our results demonstrate the impact of @GENE$ antagonism on @DISEASE$ activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following @DISEASE$	1
203	These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of @GENE$ antagonism , which has been investigated as a therapeutic for @DISEASE$ , in which @DISEASE$ is a contributing factor .	1
204	Higher expression of @GENE$ observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes ( neutrophils ) during @DISEASE$	1
205	The role of pDC ' s in production of @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ infection was investigated by depleting mice of pDC ' s the day before @DISEASE$ infection using a @GENE$ [ 26 ]	1
206	The @GENE$ response at 16 hours postinfection with @DISEASE$ , as measured by ELISA , was abolished by pDC depletion ( Figure 3A )	1
207	Combined with the dependence on @GENE$ upregulation of @GENE$ on B cells in vitro , the data indicate ( B ) Upregulation of @GENE$ on major splenic lymphocyte subsets at 16hpi with @DISEASE$ was analyzed by co - staining with @GENE$ for @GENE$ and either @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ as indicated	1
208	g004 hypothesis that @GENE$ played a key role in inducing @DISEASE$	1
209	Furthermore , to investigate whether @GENE$ and @GENE$ played particularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ in the transgenic mice , we neutralized @GENE$ and blocked the @GENE$ in the livers of these mice	1
210	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ virus inhibits cellular @GENE$ activity by blocking ubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation of @GENE$ in human @DISEASE$ cells	1
211	Artemisia fukudo Makino essential oil , mainly constituted by α - thujone , β - thujone , camphor , and caryophyllene attenuates @DISEASE$ - induced inflammation by suppressing @GENE$ and @GENE$ activation in RAW 264	1
212	In an outbred species , partial antiviral protection has only been described in two studies so far , in which reduced shedding of @DISEASE$ was observed in lambs after administration also of a @GENE$ [ 52 , 53 ]	1
213	This important observation indicated that @GENE$ - induced @DISEASE$ clearance was mediated by @GENE$ and CD8 T cells	1
214	Many studies have shown that spontaneous viral clearance during @DISEASE$ is characterized by a vigorous , broadly reactive @GENE$ and CD8 T - cell response	1
215	Currently , there are two main methods for detecting an @DISEASE$ infection : one detects @GENE$ by RT - PCR ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) and the other detects @GENE$ by immunoassay [ enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ] in serum ( 9 , 10 )	1
216	Therefore , the purpose of our study was to develop an affordable and reliable rapid lateral flow test to detect the presence of @GENE$ odies in blood samples by screening for @GENE$ , which would help decrease the chances of @DISEASE$ infection from blood transfusions .	1
217	@GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , that would be present during generalized inflammation , facilitate a pathological anti - endothelial response of circulating @GENE$ and @GENE$ associated with @DISEASE$ [ 125 , 126 ]	1
218	Other studies support significant @GENE$ mediated cytotoxicity against endothelial cells in @DISEASE$ patients [ 127 ]	1
219	Prevalent @GENE$ anti - endothelial responses in @DISEASE$ have also been shown without @GENE$ stimulation [ 127 , 128 ]	1
220	In a mouse model system , anti - @GENE$ antibody responses were replicated , but these did not demonstrate @DISEASE$ [ 129 ]	1
221	Originally , @GENE$ was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation ; however , following ~ 10 years of investigation , it has been demonstrated that @GENE$ participates in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor ( 14 )	1
222	In this study , it was revealed that levels of the precursor of @GENE$ were decreased in the patients with @DISEASE$ and markedly increased in the patients with @DISEASE$	1
223	Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin β chain variant @GENE$ , which has been implicated in in @DISEASE$ ( 15 ) , although not in @DISEASE$ .	1
224	Nevertheless , the immunogenicity of @GENE$ requires further characterization in preclinical models for @DISEASE$	1
225	Of note , the @GENE$ enables characterization of T cell responses in BALB / c mice that serve as a well - established @DISEASE$ infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with @GENE$ [ 24 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 ]	1
226	A particular feature of @DISEASE$ in humans , as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals , is the lack of detectable @GENE$ in patients with confirmed disease [ 66 , 67 ]	1
227	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 6 ]	1
228	A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that @GENE$ activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of @DISEASE$ patients [ 9 ]	1
229	In contrast to the protection of @GENE$ against the infection of EV71 in hSCARB3 - transgenic mice , administration of the same amount of antibody did not protect hSCARB3 - transgenic mice from lethal @DISEASE$ infection	1
230	We report here in our retrospective analysis that intravenous @GENE$ administration in the initial stages of severe @DISEASE$ did not improve overall outcomes or the severity of disease .	1
231	Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is released from cell membranes by @GENE$ under the stimulus of several factors associated with @DISEASE$	1
232	The @GENE$ of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and SEOV possess an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in the @GENE$ that binds to @GENE$ , and the ITAM may also interact with @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ found in lymphocytes [ 58 , 59 ] , although there is no evidence that lymphocytes are susceptible to @DISEASE$	1
233	In @DISEASE$ cell culture models , MPA could induce the expression of important @GENE$ , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 46 ]	1
234	Moreover , MPA could have effects in synergy with @GENE$ - on HCV replication in the same @DISEASE$ experiments	1
235	With the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with @GENE$ , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against @DISEASE$ in vivo	1
236	The function of @GENE$ is unknown , but they have been implicated in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and immunity	1
237	Of these , @GENE$ have emerged as broadacting @GENE$ capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( @DISEASE$ 1 ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]	1
238	To stress the importance that @GENE$ play in the control of @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ knockout mice display increased mortality and viral burden following @DISEASE$ challenge [ 8 , 13 ] and a specific polymorphism in the @GENE$ allele has been associated to increased susceptibility to @DISEASE$ in humans [ 13 , 14 ] .	1
239	In @DISEASE$ infection , the most important @GENE$ are @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$  ( @GENE$ )	1
240	@GENE$ recognizes @GENE$ , which is formed as an intermediate during @DISEASE$ replication [ 113 , 114 ]	1
241	Although there are several mechanisms in which mosquito - borne flaviviruses actively suppress the induction of @GENE$ , no such mechanism has been identified in @DISEASE$ so far [ 177 ]	1
242	Instead , TBEV , like other @DISEASE$ , utilizes a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes , and thus delaying the recognition by the @GENE$ and subsequent @GENE$ phosphorylation and @GENE$ induction ( Figure 4A ) [ 80 , 81 , 83 ] .	1
243	On the other hand , despite extensive efforts in drug development targeting @GENE$ , a series of drug - resistant mutants from @DISEASE$ have been reported , such as the I223R / H275Y dual mutation of @GENE$ from influenza A H1N1 , which shows enormous resistance towards oseltamivir ( approximately 7500 times that of the wild type ; van der Vries et al	1
244	To examine possible transmission of @DISEASE$ through biting , grooming , blood sharing , or fecal - oral exposure , we used metagenomic data from a parallel study to screen vampire bat saliva and fecal samples for @GENE$	1
245	The development of targeted agents for @DISEASE$ has been greatly hindered by two factors - the incomplete understanding of @GENE$ EASE$ substrate specificity and , until recently , the paucity of high - resolution atomic structures	1
246	For example , @GENE$ over - expression can effectively induce apoptosis in @DISEASE$ cells 40	1
247	Also , elevations in @GENE$ protein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine @DISEASE$ cells 41	1
248	Therefore , over - expression of the @GENE$ may be a new strategy for the treatment of @DISEASE$ , especially for @DISEASE$ bearing p53 mutations .	1
249	The purpose of this analysis was to systematically investigate the potential effect of @GENE$ on the outcomes of @DISEASE$ patients requiring ECMO therapy	1
250	In addition , a single injection of @GENE$ is known to lead to the same @DISEASE$ as those observed in the LPS models 66 ( @GENE$ is thought to be a key cytokine in the link between @DISEASE$ and the @DISEASE$ in the offspring 38 )	1
251	In our previous report , maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased @GENE$ levels in the @DISEASE$ fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the @DISEASE$ later in life	1
252	These @GENE$ are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and @DISEASE$ in the neonatal rodent 69	1
253	The slides were incubated with the @GENE$ ( Biodesign , USA ) targeting the @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ viruses applied at 1 : 1500 dilution , for 80 min at room temperature	1
254	@GENE$ had been approved to successfully prevent @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT	1
255	A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV - RNA + @DISEASE$ patients who started a 12 - month @GENE$ plus RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [ 64 ]	1
256	However , higher than 26 % of @DISEASE$ was noted in another study using @GENE$ and RBV combination therapy for more than 12 months [ 65 ]	1
257	Moreover , four other studies using different regiments , two @GENE$ monotherapy and two pegylated - @GENE$ monotherapy , showed a poor effect of less than 20 % of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and @DISEASE$ [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ]	1
258	Using @GENE$ from cervicovaginal fluid of three @DISEASE$ - infected women and from seminal fluid of three infected men , enhanced transcytosis occurred at @GENE$ concentrations well within their expected range in genital tract secretions ( Figure 4A and 4B ) [ 18 ]	1
259	Consistent with @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ , higher concentrations of @GENE$ generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .	1
260	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , another member of the family Flaviviridae , is an essential component of the @GENE$ [ 9 ] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [ 10 , 11 ]	1
261	In addition , the @GENE$ decreases @GENE$ - mediated translation in a dose - dependent manner and the key sites ( K399 , T401 , E406 and L413 ) are also found in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 15 ]	1
262	In line with observations published recently , the induction of @GENE$ by this @GENE$ remained moderate [ 34 ] ; nevertheless , the measurements carried out 24 h after stimulation of purified feline cells support induction of Th1 - oriented immune responses and enhanced NK cell activity , both highly desired in the contexts of @DISEASE$ .	1
263	Secreted into the cell medium , the @GENE$ efficiently entered @DISEASE$ - infected cells through a @GENE$ - mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV - 1 transcription and replication ( Figure 1 ) .	1
264	Oral administration of specificantibody - containing egg yolk , or SDP to weaned piglets showed in some cases no protection against ETEC strains or @DISEASE$ outcomes , likely because the contained @GENE$ were not specific against the infecting ETEC strains present on the farm [ 2 ]	1
265	Protein levels of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , a mediator of inflammation , were reported elevated in several @DISEASE$ types , including @DISEASE$ , and suppression of either @GENE$ expression or @GENE$ activation , is being considered for @DISEASE$ prevention and therapy [ 2 ]	1
266	Of the five prostaglandins ( PG ) produced by @GENE$ , PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in @DISEASE$ cell proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , and immunosuppression [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
267	The @GENE$ responsible for the increased proteolysis associated with aggressive forms of @DISEASE$ represent candidate therapeutic targets	1
268	The over - expression of @GENE$ on the surface and neo - vasculature of @DISEASE$ has made it the most studied member of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and the most targeted	1
269	Immunization with @GENE$ suppressed HCV protein levels in the liver , and this suppression was associated with ameliorated pathological @DISEASE$ findings ( see Figure 3 )	1
270	Importantly , @GENE$ treatment did not cause @DISEASE$ based on the serum @GENE$ levels ; therefore , this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes	1
271	These findings provided strong evidence that @GENE$ treatment effectively halted the progression of @DISEASE$	1
272	Immunization with @GENE$ or with recombinant vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with @DISEASE$ infection [ 20 , 21 ]	1
273	In the model describe here ; the animals were immune competent for HCV ; therefore , our findings provided further important evidence that @GENE$ was effective in the treatment of @DISEASE$ .	1
274	Purified @GENE$ derived from the @GENE$ construct [ 32 ] , encoding a @DISEASE$ - 1 mutant virus , were lysed and incubated with 2	1
275	@DISEASE$ with increased @GENE$ level reported in FeL is usually found in chronic infections caused by viruses , bacteria or systemic fungi , or inflammation associated with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , or in @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ .	1
276	While bats are well prepared to control @DISEASE$ , they also have mechanisms to avoid over - induction of @GENE$	1
277	Genome analysis of black flying foxes and @DISEASE$ have also demonstrated positive selection pressure on the @GENE$ [ 21 ]	1
278	This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of @GENE$ , thereby maintaining a balanced response to @DISEASE$ .	1
279	Moreover , the @GENE$ produced in MVA - MERS - N infected cells was strongly recognized by @GENE$ from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that @GENE$ - specific immune responses were potently activated upon @DISEASE$ infection	1
280	This might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of @GENE$ despite a barely productive @DISEASE$ infection	1
281	Passive transfer of @GENE$ has been shown to reduce the severity of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 26 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 27 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 28 ]	1
282	Here we show that by using @GENE$ , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
283	More importantly , @DISEASE$ presenting @GENE$ are present in CLN of chronically infected mice ( 13 )	1
284	These data indicated that @GENE$ unspecifically regulate overall CLN cellularity and T cell activation during @DISEASE$ persistence but specifically limit expansion of SR CD4 T cells emerging after onset of @DISEASE$	1
285	To further investigate the role of @GENE$ , Hsu cells were transfected with a @GENE$ containing @GENE$ cloned under @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , infected with @DISEASE$ at 24 h post - transfection , and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi	1
286	Combined , the above data suggest that @GENE$ plays a significant pro - viral role during @DISEASE$ .	1
287	Likewise , it has been shown that human @DISEASE$ mutants lacking the @GENE$ are still able to form infectious particles in vitro [ 24 ]	1
288	In concordance with studies performed in @DISEASE$ cells before , we demonstrate PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , through increased @GENE$ gene expression that is dependent on @GENE$ and induction of @GENE$	1
289	It unveils a novel role of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in mediating @DISEASE$ induced by PGE 2	1
290	Moreover , @DISEASE$ in pigs might be associated with secondary @DISEASE$ [ 66 ] and inactivation of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) of an ETEC : F4 challenge strain did not decrease the incidence of this @DISEASE$ in orally challenged gnotobiotic piglets [ 66 ]	1
291	These antiviral effects of @GENE$ have not only been observed against viruses with a @GENE$ but also ssRNA viruses such as CSFV [ 25 ] and several plant viruses such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 27 ]	1
292	The F 0 69 , 90 , and 135 lines were selected from 10 F 0 lines for further analysis based on @GENE$ expression levels in the TG mice lines and previous therapeutics experiments , which showed that @DISEASE$ was detected in muscle and brains after mice were challenged with PRV and @GENE$ by intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections , respectively	1
293	The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with @DISEASE$ were verified using western blotting : @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Fig	1
294	To determine whether @GENE$ antagonism impacts survival from @DISEASE$ , mice were fed PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , then infected with @DISEASE$ [ 42 ] at either 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad ( f	1
295	However , the role of B cells and @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis remains unclear	1
296	Notably , a number of @GENE$ responses have been reported in children with @DISEASE$	1
297	Here , we will review and discuss the inconsistencies in the literature in relation to B cell responses , @GENE$ , and a potential role for humoral immunity in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis or diagnosis .	1
298	@GENE$ content was recovered by immunoprecipitation with @GENE$ derived from @DISEASE$ patient sera pre - bound to GammaBind Plus Sepharose ( GE Healthcare )	1
299	To determine the extent of this phenotype , @GENE$ were tested according to the same experimental approach described above using : HIV - 1 vectors pseudotyped with the @DISEASE$ virus envelope ( GALV ) and with the @DISEASE$ virus RD114 envelope ( @GENE$ , containing the @GENE$ of the MLV amphotropic envelope for efficient pseudotyping of lentiviral particles , as described in [ 29 ] , Figure 1D ) , or vectors derived from different GFP - coding retroviruses ( @DISEASE$ , SIV MAC ; @DISEASE$ , MLV ) along with HIV - 1 , all pseudotyped with the @GENE$ ( Figure 1E )	1
300	@GENE$ has been shown to associate with the @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation ( 34 , 35 )	1
301	We previously showed that @GENE$ can be applied to protect PK15 cells from @DISEASE$ infection	1
302	PK15 cells harboring @GENE$ show resistance to @DISEASE$ ( CSFV ) through @GENE$ activity [ 25 ]	1
303	But , @GENE$ with a completely different mechanism than antiviral agents is expected to be effective against a broad spectrum of @DISEASE$ .	1
304	Together , our data indicate that pDC ' s activated in a @GENE$ manner are primarily responsible for the rapid systemic @GENE$ response following infection of mice with @DISEASE$	1
305	Furthermore , the @GENE$ response was most likely responsible for the transient expression of the CD69 @GENE$ on lymphocytes during @DISEASE$	1
306	@GENE$ - dependent , partial activation of lymphocytes has also been reported during acute infection with @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] , human @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 32 ] in mice	1
307	Epithelial cells from the respiratory tract release @GENE$ in response to a @DISEASE$ , also known as " @GENE$ , " which include @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ; these @GENE$ activate immune cells like T cells , dendritic cells , and macrophages , normally driving a Th2 immune response ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 )	1
308	We therefore investigated the impact of these @GENE$ which could be potentially released by @DISEASE$ - infected epithelial cells	1
309	In this light , we compared the structure of the @GENE$ with two structures of drug - resistant mutants of viral @GENE$ ( the I223R mutant of H1N1 and the H274Y mutant of H5N1 ) to examine the use of diplacone against @DISEASE$ e the low sequence identity and low homology of viral neuraminidases from influenza A ( IA - NA ) and B ( IB - NA ) with @GENE$ ( identity : @GENE$ , 11	1
310	The assays appear specific to the intended squirrel pathogens , as neither SQPV nor SADV qPCR assays amplified ( 0 / 6 reactions ) a product in qPCRs seeded with either @GENE$ E$ , @DISEASE$ or canine adenovirus 1 or 2 DNA .	1
311	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ in lice found on infected individuals was 80 % ( 4 / 5 : 95 % CI , 30 - 99 % ) , which combined with the relatively high occurrence of @GENE$ in blood ( 67 % ( 6 / 9 ) ; 95 % CI 31 - 91 % ) may suggest a potential role of the parasite in pathogen transmission	1
312	Taken together , @GENE$ has been shown to be an @GENE$ that strongly inhibits @DISEASE$ in vivo and in vitro	1
313	Taken together , studies so far have demonstrated the importance of the @GENE$ - I - like - @GENE$ pathway in @DISEASE$ , whereas the role of the TLR pathways remains unclear .	1
314	Likewise , addition and removal of acetyl groups by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) can have a dramatic effect on viruses such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
315	The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in @GENE$ levels in the progression of @DISEASE$ using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) analysis , in addition to comparing the @GENE$ levels of patients with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , patients with @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ - induced ACLF ) and normal individuals	1
316	Five of those proteins , @GENE$ , hemoglobin β chain variant @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with @DISEASE$ , were subsequently verified using western blotting	1
317	To investigate whether the schedule of N3 treatment is ideal for protecting from @DISEASE$ in vivo , 7 - day old @GENE$ mice were preinfected s	1
318	Recently , genetic variation in the region of the @GENE$ on @GENE$ , coding for @GENE$ , has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with @DISEASE$ in patients with genotype 1 @DISEASE$ who are treated with @GENE$ plus RBV in the nontransplant setting [ 23 , 24 ]	1
319	@GENE$ polymorphism has also been associated with spontaneous @DISEASE$ clearance [ 25 ]	1
320	One cohort study , Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive @DISEASE$ patients undergoing LT , aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient @GENE$ genotypes among @DISEASE$ recipients [ 26 ]	1
321	The authors suggested that recipient @GENE$ TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of @DISEASE$ after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with @DISEASE$ .	1
322	The presence of high - titer @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ infections of reservoir hosts indicates both T cell and B cell responses occur because T cells induce class switching and affinity maturation of @GENE$ produced by antigen - specific B cells	1
323	@GENE$ responses are critical for suppressing inflammation [ 71 , 72 ] ; however , inflammation is a prominent feature of @DISEASE$ in humans [ 73 ] and hamsters [ 55 , 74 ]	1
324	In other @DISEASE$ , the occurrence of a @GENE$ response is associated with persistent infection because these cells , while suppressing inflammation , also prevent virus clearance [ 75 , 76 ]	1
325	For reservoirs of @DISEASE$ , the @GENE$ response may limit inflammatory immunopathology to an otherwise innocuous infection , but it may also impair virus clearance	1
326	To investigate the mechanism of lymphocyte activation following @DISEASE$ we first analyzed the kinetics of @GENE$ upregulation on splenic lymphocytes at several time points following infection	1
327	In contrast to @GENE$ , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on @GENE$ ligation [ 21 ] , did not increase in expression during the first day of @DISEASE$ ( data not shown )	1
328	Stressors , such as @GENE$ responses and @DISEASE$ , can induce the expression of @GENE$ that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ] .	1
329	Because of the sensitivity of microglia and @DISEASE$ to @GENE$ antagonism , we assessed whether @GENE$ antagonism depleted CD11b + , Ly6C + , and Ly6G + cells in the blood , spleen , and bone marrow of PLX5622 - treated versus control - treated uninfected mice	1
330	Together , these data indicate that circulating @DISEASE$ , but not bone marrow or splenic mononuclear cells , are decreased in the context of @GENE$ antagonism .	1
331	Importantly , the levels did not correlate with @GENE$ and were not excessive , which are characteristics of PB responses in @DISEASE$	1
332	The aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with @DISEASE$ and HBV - induced @DISEASE$ , respectively , compared with healthy controls using @GENE$ and western blotting	1
333	The data suggested that the full - length @GENE$ and the new @GENE$ ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) were suitable for analyzing the presence of @GENE$ against individual @GENE$ teins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from @DISEASE$	1
334	reported in their results that the rate of recurrent @DISEASE$ , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to @GENE$ therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] .	1
335	We conclude that administration of @GENE$ as an additional therapy did not have a beneficial effect in patients with severe @DISEASE$ requiring ECMO support .	1
336	The median serum @GENE$ concentration was also higher in the @DISEASE$ group than in the @DISEASE$ group ( 1	1
337	02 ) , and the @GENE$ concentration tended to be higher in the @DISEASE$ group than in the @DISEASE$ group ( 20	1
338	In @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ was shown to control LGTV dissemination and replication in the brain after intraperitoneal administration , and @GENE$ promoted survival after @DISEASE$ [ 141 ]	1
339	@GENE$ ' s role within the brain during @DISEASE$ was further mapped to certain brain regions , as @GENE$ inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum , but not in the cerebellum or brainstem	1
340	This correlates very well with @DISEASE$ since @GENE$ strongly inhibited TBEV replication in primary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum , but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum	1
341	Enhanced transcytosis with @GENE$ at low pH also occurred with T84 @DISEASE$ cells ( Figure S2 ) .	1
342	Given that @DISEASE$ is a single - stranded RNA virus , we investigated whether the pDC - dependent @GENE$ response was mediated by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which is highly expressed by pDC ' s , binds to @GENE$ , and is capable of initiating @GENE$ responses in pDC ' s without their direct infection [ 28 ]	1
343	Mice containing a genetically inactivated @GENE$ gene [ 29 , 30 ] failed to mount @GENE$ responses or to upregulate @GENE$ expression in response to @DISEASE$ infection , whereas genetically matched TLR7 wild type mice showed strong @GENE$ responses and @GENE$ upregulation ( Figure 4A , B )	1
344	Consistent with the results from pDC depletions , @DISEASE$ plasma titers were again not significantly different in the absence of @GENE$ expression and @GENE$ production ( Figure 4C )	1
345	These results are similar to data from @DISEASE$ mice infected with @DISEASE$ , although that study noted slight ( two fold ) increases in virus titers in the absence of @GENE$ signaling [ 31 ] .	1
346	( 1982 ) showed antiviral effects against @DISEASE$ ( M - MuLV ) with @GENE$	1
347	As an upstream regulator of @GENE$ , @GENE$ signaling is thought to play a key role in @DISEASE$ cell growth , survival and @DISEASE$ angiogenesis [ 10 , 11 ]	1
348	Studies have shown high levels of activated @GENE$ in a large percentage of common @DISEASE$ types , including @DISEASE$ [ 12 ]	1
349	When activated in @DISEASE$ cells , @GENE$ also has multiple effects that promote disease progression , including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of @DISEASE$ cell proliferation , metabolism , and angiogenesis [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
350	Thus , the PDK1 @GENE$ signaling pathway represents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of @DISEASE$	1
351	The expression of @GENE$ was examined in the androgen receptor negative @DISEASE$ cell lines PC3 and DU145 using a commercially available antibody	1
352	The antiviral effects of the supernatants were initially tested on @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) as control , as this virus is widely recognized for both its potential to induce CPE in cell lines of multiple species and for its particularly high sensitivity to the effects of @GENE$ [ 65 , 66 ]	1
353	When the @GENE$ derived from the PBMCs of eight adult cats that had broadly responded to in vitro ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2B and C , groups 2 and 3 ) were incubated with fcwf - 4 cells prior to their inoculation , significant inhibition of @DISEASE$ replication was observed ( p = 0	1
354	They engineered a zymogen form of the apoptosis - promoting enzyme @GENE$ that , upon entry into @DISEASE$ - infected cells , would be processed into its active form by the @GENE$ ( Figure 1 )	1
355	While @GENE$ remained inactive in uninfected cells , its uptake resulted in massive apoptosis in @DISEASE$ - infected Jurkat T cells	1
356	Background : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) belong to a family of highly related @GENE$ that have been shown to interfere with a large spectrum of viruses including Filoviruses , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
357	During the second season 2011 / 12 , @GENE$ was rare ( 1 % ) , whereas @GENE$ was diagnosed in 75 % of cases and co - circulated with @DISEASE$ ( 24 % )	1
358	Inoculated mice developed chronic infection with transient @DISEASE$ , and shed virus principally in urine , saliva and , to a lesser extent , feces , despite the production of @GENE$ .	1
359	Both microglia and astrocytes are important for normal neurodevelopment , however under @DISEASE$ , they are activated , their function is altered , and they have an adverse effect on neurons and axons , with the overproduction of @GENE$ - inflammatory cytokines 34	1
360	In addition to the relative poor efficacy , safety of @GENE$ is another concern in patients with @DISEASE$	1
361	These data suggested that patients with @DISEASE$ should be closely monitored during @GENE$ therapy and followed by experts with considerable experience	1
362	Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any @DISEASE$ that could be associated with the clinical signs of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , and if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a @GENE$ fPL ≥ 5	1
363	@GENE$ and @GENE$ are of current interest as potential targets in therapies form diverse @DISEASE$ .	1
364	In several studies , @DISEASE$ and overexpression of genes encoding @GENE$ were identified in patients with @DISEASE$ [ 6 , 16 , 17 ]	1
365	We included IVIG therapy in our @DISEASE$ patients based on these considerations , although we did not measure @GENE$ levels before treatment	1
366	Indeed , in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients , high @GENE$ levels were associated with high mortality in @DISEASE$ patients [ 18 ]	1
367	PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to @GENE$ in the blood of patients with @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
368	@GENE$ levels remain low in non - surviving @DISEASE$ patients , whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [ 20 ]	1
369	@GENE$ disruption decreases the number and size of @DISEASE$ in APC [UNK] 716 knockout mice [ 43 ]	1
370	In addition to @DISEASE$ , it has been shown that @GENE$ were elevated whereas @GENE$ levels were decreased in @DISEASE$ in COX - 2 - MMTV mice [ 44 ]	1
371	It was showed that @GENE$ 2 promotes @DISEASE$ cell migration via EP4 - betaArrestin1 - @GENE$ pathway [ 45 ]	1
372	Most recently , we found that the @GENE$ could increase the expression of @GENE$ [ 16 ] , which has been found to play a pivotal role in activating @GENE$ ( including @GENE$ ) that increase cellular growth and @DISEASE$ formation in @DISEASE$ cells	1
373	Moreover , the post - weaning period is a critical phase in the pig ' s life when the intestinal immune system is immature , and the sow milk removal , and consequent discontinuation of nutritive intake of the @GENE$ present in this milk , contributes to increase susceptibility of pigs to @DISEASE$ [ 31 ]	1
374	@GENE$ represent an example of how understanding how pathogens interact with human host cells can lead to new ways to treat and prevent @DISEASE$ .	1
375	Gene knock - down experiments were conducted to determine the significance of @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ infection	1
376	Hsu cells were transfected with long dsRNA against @GENE$ , infected with @DISEASE$ at 24 h post - transfection , and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi	1
377	Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection , the presence of @DISEASE$ within CNS - draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low levels of @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ in control DTR − mice ( Figure 2D )	1
378	Elevated levels of several @GENE$ and @GENE$ have been reported in children with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 13 , 15 ]	1
379	Moreover , similar results were reported in clinical cases that @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with @DISEASE$ after administration of IVIG	1
380	Assessment of @DISEASE$ efficiencies in cultured cells employed @GENE$ , which encodes a self - cleaving nsp1 ␤ - nsp2 polyprotein under the control of a T7 promoter ( 19 )	1
381	Moreover , BALB / c mice transduced with the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive @DISEASE$ , which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS - CoV - specific immunization using the @GENE$ [ 24 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 ]	1
382	Several species of bats control @DISEASE$ by having a mutation at a highly conserved serine residue in one of the key @GENE$ for sensing damaged DNA , i	1
383	Administration of molecular hydrogen during pregnancy improves @DISEASE$ of offspring in a maternal immune activation model @GENE$ 	1
384	To evaluate whether @GENE$ injection caused @DISEASE$ in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice , we examined serum ALT levels and liver histology following poly ( I : C ) injection	1
385	Based on these findings , we believe that the effects of @GENE$ injection in these mice did not confound our analysis of @DISEASE$ .	1
386	@GENE$ and @GENE$ , which have @GENE$ activity , have been used as @GENE$ against potato spindle tuber viroid and @DISEASE$ , respectively [ 21 , 22 ]	1
387	Immunization studies in adults ( @DISEASE$ [ 141 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 132 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 142 ] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment for @GENE$ , temporally peak 5 - 10 days after immunization , and are predictive of later sero - immunity [ 143 ]	1
388	This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying @DISEASE$ , and specifically correlates with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) level in studies on @DISEASE$ [ 145 , 146 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 147 , 148 ] .	1
389	Collectively , our results show that previously generated @GENE$ , which targeted VP1 linear epitope @GENE$ and neutralized subgenogroups B4 and B5 strains of EV71 in vitro [ 17 ] , was also able to cross - protect @DISEASE$ in vitro ( Fig	1
390	N3 conferred protection through the reduction of viral load and the secretion of @GENE$ that contributed to @DISEASE$ and immunopathogenesis .	1
391	In human @DISEASE$ cells , @GENE$ protein could directly associate with the F - box protein @GENE$ and heterologous expression of the @GENE$ protein led to reduced recruitment of @GENE$ and @GENE$ subunits to the @GENE$ , resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the @GENE$	1
392	The relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) values , effective number of codon ( ENC ) values , nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) among 48 @DISEASE$ isolates including 31 of genotype 1 , 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3 .	1
393	Our results demonstrate that nocodazole treatment decreased the @GENE$ levels ( Figure 6A ) and the TCID50 / ml value ( Figure 6B ) of Fermon , US / KY / 14 - 18953 and US / MO / 14 - 18947 , which suggests that the virus inhibition upon G2 / M synchronization may be similar for all @DISEASE$ .	1
394	By inhibiting the enzymatic activity of @GENE$ , we found that cyc - LHSPW was therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo in a model of highly aggressive @DISEASE$	1
395	With this aggressive form of @DISEASE$ on the rise , it is highly plausible the future treatments for @DISEASE$ could involve targeting @GENE$ .	1
396	Viruses 2015 , 7 4564 Keywords : @DISEASE$ virus ; virus - host interactions ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ 	1
397	Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , a receptor of EV71 and CVA16 ) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$	1
398	These results indicate @GENE$ could be useful in treating severe @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ - transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti - enterovirus agent candidates .	1
399	Qing Ge also demonstrated that @GENE$ or a component of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a good antiviral drug to protect against @DISEASE$ by inhibiting @GENE$ transcription with @GENE$ [ 5 ]	1
400	While asymptomatic @DISEASE$ infection had been detected using RT - PCR testing at the time of outbreak , 9 a Saudi Arabian study showed the longevity of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ patients varied in the severity of illness	1
401	Streptococcus pneumoniae , the leading cause of @DISEASE$ [ 39 ] , is characterized by over 90 serotypes differentiated by variations in the @GENE$ [ 40 , 41 ] and associated with different propensities of invasive potential [ 42 ]	1
402	In @DISEASE$ infection , @GENE$ was shown to inhibit the JAK @GENE$ pathway and @GENE$ was shown to interact with the @GENE$ [ 148 ]	1
403	In @DISEASE$ infection , @GENE$ treatment failed to reduce viral titers when added after infection , this effect was also found to be mediated by the @GENE$ antagonism [ 180 , 183 ] .	1
404	Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were constructed to determine the performances of BAL fluid cellular components , @GENE$ concentration , and @GENE$ concentration for predicting @DISEASE$	1
405	Third , administration of the @GENE$ agonist , nitrazepam , restores @DISEASE$ behavior in @GENE$ ( K92 ) and KO mutant mice , and these effects could be blocked by the @GENE$ antagonist flumazenil ( Imai et al	1
406	Moreover , diverse RNA viruses , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ encode one or more @GENE$ , potentially conferring the ability to specifically recognize , and possibly reverse , ADPribosylation upon these viruses [ 19 ]	1
407	For example , overexpression of @GENE$ , also known as @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , is sufficient to restrict replication of several different families of viruses , including a @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ [ 23 ] ) , @DISEASE$ ( Ebola and Marburg [ 24 ] ) , a @DISEASE$ ( Sindbis [ 25 ] ) and a @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ [ 26 ] )	1
408	It is noteworthy that @DISEASE$ infection induces autophagy in the hepatocytes via the @GENE$ response , and the autophagy induced by HCV is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes [ 49 ]	1
409	Although @GENE$ may play an important role in the innate immune response during @DISEASE$ , nonspecific immunoglobulins may not be as effective in a @DISEASE$ environment	1
410	Recently , putative @GENE$ have been identified in some @DISEASE$ [ 3 , 67 ]	1
411	In other bunyaviruses , @GENE$ has anti - interferon activity [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] ; however , its role in @DISEASE$ is less well characterized .	1
412	Increased @GENE$ levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis , but they also can increase immunity to @DISEASE$ 48	1
413	For example , over - expressed @GENE$ is suggested to promote @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ; for these @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ inhibitors may be used as anti - cancer agents [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ]	1
414	Whereas , a loss of @GENE$ immunopositivity is related to the development and progression of @DISEASE$ in smokers with @DISEASE$ 52	1
415	As the influence of the @GENE$ expression changes due to different @DISEASE$ , the anti - cancer significance of the differential expression of @GENE$ in CPV - infected cells is complicated and requires further study .	1
416	The digested samples were labelled with each component of the @GENE$ reagent kit : two mock samples were labelled with 113 and 114 ; and five @DISEASE$ - infected samples collected at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hpi were labelled with 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 , and 119 , respectively	1
417	All of the challenged birds shed @GENE$ via the tracheal route on day 4 pi and showed signs of mild depression , ruffled feathers and a transitory arched posture , while we recorded @DISEASE$ in approximately onethird of the layers	1
418	The hallmarks of astrocytic activation include the development of a @DISEASE$ morphology with fewer processes and upregulation of @GENE$ , particularly @GENE$	1
419	To evaluate the @DISEASE$ soma , the cellular size of the astrocytes was also quantified by calculating the ratio of @GENE$ immunostained area to the number of GFAP - positive cells	1
420	The @GENE$ response in vivo in mice is very important to protect mice from lethal infection with @DISEASE$	1
421	Mice lacking @GENE$ all succumbed within 6 days of infection , whereas 80 % of @DISEASE$ mice ( 6 - 8 - week - old ) survived the infection	1
422	Interestingly , all @GENE$ − / − mice survived the infection , demonstrating that the @GENE$ can compensate for loss of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$	1
423	Furthermore , @GENE$ was shown to be a critical determinant of @DISEASE$ tropism as @GENE$ was found in all organs in the absence of @GENE$ , whereas in @DISEASE$ , only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [ 99 , 128 , 141 ]	1
424	Using transgenic mice , it was further shown that the @GENE$ response was needed both in the peripheral tissue , as well as locally in the CNS , in order to clear @DISEASE$ [ 99 , 100 ] .	1
425	The experiments conducted both in vitro and in vivo in this study underline the feasibility of utilizing @GENE$ as a marker for induction of resistance to @DISEASE$ in the domestic cat	1
426	The rapid systemic appearance of @GENE$ expression suggested that a soluble factor such as @GENE$ , a known early responder to @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] and strong trigger of @GENE$ expression [ 17 , 19 , 20 ] , was inducing the response	1
427	These findings suggested that the @GENE$ response to @DISEASE$ infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well .	1
428	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 37 ] and full @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 38 , 39 ] were cloned from a blood sample taken from a patient ( # R6 ) with @DISEASE$ ( Text S1 )	1
429	Interestingly , @GENE$ from SARS - CoV , MHV and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , also induced autophagy .	1
430	2014 ) , and @GENE$ ) are all associated with @DISEASE$ ; these genes are known to be required for cardiovascular development	1
431	This pathotype is characterized by the production of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , both essential for disease development [ 7 ] , the predominant @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ being @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 6 , 8 ]	1
432	Small intestinal adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC in pigs is mediated by F4 or F18 specific @GENE$ , the existence and function of these receptors being crucial to determine the susceptibility of pigs to @DISEASE$ [ 7 ]	1
433	The predominant serogroup of ETEC associated with @DISEASE$ in pigs worldwide is O149 , commonly in the combination O149 : LT : STa : STb : EAST1 : @GENE$ [ 2 ]	1
434	Transfer of Foxp3 + @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ limited @DISEASE$ damage by inhibiting T cell proliferation within CLN and reducing overall T cell numbers within the CNS , yet without affecting frequencies of virus - specific T cells ( 20 )	1
435	These studies predicted that @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion during @DISEASE$ would increase T cell numbers in CLN and CNS	1
436	The results showed that @GENE$ knockdown resulted in increased @GENE$ activity in @DISEASE$ - infected cells using @GENE$ and @GENE$ conducted on lysates collected from cells treated as in B	1
437	@GENE$ are @GENE$ that occur as the @GENE$ , @GENE$ , or @GENE$ variant , the F4ac variant being by far the most important type encountered in @DISEASE$ [ 50 ]	1
438	The @GENE$ mediate bacterial attachment to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , present on the small intestinal brush borders of villous enterocytes allowing ETEC to survive and persist in the small intestine and cause @DISEASE$ [ 51 ]	1
439	@GENE$ is commonly associated with ETEC causing @DISEASE$ , whereas @GENE$ is often involved in @DISEASE$ [ 52 ]	1
440	A @GENE$ identified as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ involved in diffuse adherence ) has been observed to be associated with ETEC strains recovered from pigs with @DISEASE$ [ 54 ]	1
441	Moreover , it has been demonstrated that the expression of @GENE$ by a @DISEASE$ E	1
442	This study uncovered the systemic changes in @GENE$ involved in @DISEASE$ and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti - cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by @DISEASE$ infection .	1
443	Yet , in addition to selection and drift , it also appears there is very strong mutational pressure on the @GENE$ , potentially leading to lethal mutagenesis in most strains , and a gradual , natural genetic attenuation of human @DISEASE$ in general .	1
444	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) Enhances @DISEASE$ 1 ( HIV - 1 ) Transcytosis across Epithelial Cells	1
445	The expression of @GENE$ in the pulmonary myocardium are dysregulated in @DISEASE$ We chose to investigate the potential for genes involved in ion transport and calcium handling to be dysregulated in @DISEASE$	1
446	We selected 16 @GENE$ which are known to be involved in regulation of ion transport , almost all of which are also known @GENE$ for @DISEASE$ ( Table 6 ) Wang et al	1
447	We compared our @GENE$ of interest ( Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP - seq enrichment of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ in @GENE$ proximal to genes within the @GENE$ and @GENE$ dysregulated in @DISEASE$	1
448	The experiment was conducted in duplicate with two @GENE$ generated for @DISEASE$ - infected cells and two for uninfected control cells	1
449	Treatment with IVIG in @DISEASE$ patients can inhibit @DISEASE$ formation , implying a role for @GENE$ in disease pathogenesis	1
450	Limited reports of treatment with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) also support a role for B cell activation in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis [ 63 ]	1
451	In this study , we used proteomics to investigate the global profiles of differentially expressed @GENE$ under @DISEASE$	1
452	The kinetic changes in the expression levels of @GENE$ along the infection course , consisting of five different time points , were quantified , which represented an improvement over a cross - sectional picture if only a sample from a single time point was analysed ; these results provided us a kinetic view of the changed expression of @GENE$ under the cytopathic insult of @DISEASE$	1
453	Identification of @GENE$ could shed light on what cells respond during @DISEASE$ infection of reservoir hosts	1
454	Data from closely related @DISEASE$ , equine arterivirus ( EAV ) , demonstrated that expression of @GENE$ ( homologues of @GENE$ in coronaviruses ) , in the absence of other @GENE$ , was sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements and mutation of @GENE$ blocked this function [ 2 , 3 ]	1
455	These include an increased number of vaults in immune cell types , @GENE$ - upregulation of @GENE$ , the major component of vaults , and upregulation of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) on infection with pathogens such as @DISEASE$ [ 45 ]	1
456	61 , 67 The proteins @GENE$ from human @DISEASE$ and neurovirulence factor @GENE$ from human herpesvirus ( HSV ) both interact with @GENE$ via a specific @GENE$	1
457	To determine if @GENE$ influence @DISEASE$ infection ( Laos ; MOI , 1 TCID 50 / cell ) of @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng / ml each , with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation	1
458	The @DISEASE$ were harvested as cell suspensions , immunolabeled with the @GENE$ , and acquired on a FACSCantoII ( Becton , Dickinson )	1
459	Prevalent in reproductive - age women , these @DISEASE$ are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for @GENE$ - mediated male - to - female @DISEASE$ 1 transmission [ 46 ]	1
460	To monitor the efficiency of the RNA purification and @GENE$ synthesis , @DISEASE$ virus ( TMV , 1 µL TMV solution ( 1 : 1000 ) ) was used as an exogenous internal reference added to each sample at the first step of the RNA extraction [ 58 ] .	1
461	In non - specialized epithelial cells as well as a subset of specialized immune cells that are susceptible to @DISEASE$ , 16 , 18 , 27 type @GENE$ production is an important part of the host innate immune response and is initiated by @GENE$ in the @GENE$ in response to the detection of @GENE$ such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
462	Virus challenging with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in 3D8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of @GENE$	1
463	In addition , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) infection in WT C57BL / 6 mice was lethal , whereas transgenic mice ( STG90 ) that expressed high levels of @GENE$ in liver , muscle , and brain showed a 56 % survival rate 5 days after @DISEASE$ intramuscular infection	1
464	To this end , 150 μg equivalent @GENE$ ( PRNT 50 ≈ 1 / 160 ) from week 6 RM were adoptively transferred into IFNAR − / − mice 1 day after the @DISEASE$ viral challenge	1
465	Single immunisation with the ZIKV - prME vaccine provides protection against @DISEASE$ challenge in mice lacking the @GENE$	1
466	@GENE$ was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples , but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without @DISEASE$ .	1
467	This myocardial layer also stained positively for @GENE$ ( Figure 4C , white filled arrow ) , and contained visible striations ( Figure 4C , insert with [UNK] ) previously reported to be evident in @DISEASE$ vein myocardium ( Kracklauer et al	1
468	Due to its activity directed against @GENE$ , colistin is widely used for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 10 , 74 ]	1
469	The immunity in piglets begins 7 days after oral vaccination , however , since @DISEASE$ caused by @GENE$ : F4 occurs shortly , in the first week , after weaning , an immune trough may exist in the first days after weaning during which the pigs are not protected [ 97 ]	1
470	The results ( Fig 5E ) showed that @GENE$ was co - immunoprecipitated with @GENE$ after @DISEASE$ infection in control ( GFP dsRNA ) cells , indicating ubiquitylation of @GENE$	1
471	The results suggest that @GENE$ plays a major role in ubiquitylation of @GENE$ after @DISEASE$ infection .	1
472	A review of the investigation results from the regional laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , with @DISEASE$ virus isolated from the patient ' s throat swab and @GENE$ s ( @GENE$ ) present in the serum	1
473	As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum @GENE$ levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly ( I : C ) injection ; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the @GENE$ treatment , which causes @DISEASE$ [ 11 ]	1
474	nigribarbis ( A / blow fly / Kyoto / 93 / 2004 ) was characterized as an H5N1 subtype @DISEASE$ virus based on @GENE$ gene ( NA ) sequences	1
475	In fact , in both @GENE$ [ 73 ] and @GENE$ [ 74 ] deficient mice , this @DISEASE$ is diminished [ 75 ]	1
476	This was observed after @GENE$ injection into rabbits , which exhibited a disease similar to @DISEASE$ [ 76 ]	1
477	Reactivation of the @GENE$ , manifesting as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ formation at the @GENE$ site months or years after inoculation , has been described as an important feature of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 5 , 6 ] .	1
478	The structural information on @GENE$ and comparison with the models of @GENE$ provide an insight into how the natural geranylated flavonoids can behave as antibiotics and led to the elucidation of a strategy for the design of advanced inhibitors for the treatment of @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$	1
479	Fourteen cases of @DISEASE$ from Dubai , UAE , were diagnosed in domestic crossbreds with positive faecal @GENE$ antigen test results	1
480	Sequence data for the @GENE$ was available for other @DISEASE$ samples in GenBank including one from neighboring Trinity Co	1
481	These observations , in addition to the modified histology activity index ( HAI ) scores , indicated that expression of @GENE$ caused @DISEASE$ in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice because a weak , though persistent , immune response followed an initial bout of @DISEASE$ ( Figure S1 )	1
482	It is well - known that @GENE$ directed against the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) correlate with protective immunity against @DISEASE$ in general [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
483	Since the @GENE$ is present on the cell surface , @GENE$ is considered as the major antigen to induce @GENE$ and as a key immunogen for the development of @DISEASE$ candidate vaccines [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]	1
484	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ derived from pooled plasma of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program	1
485	The foreskin , whose presence increases @DISEASE$ infection rate , could trap secretions containing @GENE$ and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH range of @GENE$ binding [ 49 ]	1
486	Additionally , @DISEASE$ , a condition associated with an increased risk of female - to - male ( as well as male - female ) @DISEASE$ transmission , results in vaginal secretions ideal for @GENE$ binding [ 26 , 27 , 50 ]	1
487	It is also possible , though less likely , that @GENE$ mediates @DISEASE$ transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse , where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions [ 30 ] .	1
488	As part of the innate immune response against virus infections targeting the respiratory tract , such as @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( 28 , 30 , 32 ) , @DISEASE$ infection of porcine NEC also induced several @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) , which would direct the migration of monocytes to the site of infection	1
489	In fact , @DISEASE$ were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by @GENE$ polarization	1
490	This is relevant , as such a polarization could also be induced following @DISEASE$ of NEC through the release of @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , from stressed and dying epithelial cells ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 )	1
491	We also demonstrated that these @GENE$ can enhance @DISEASE$ infection of macrophages , further supporting this concept .	1
492	Therefore , @GENE$ has been suggested to be a target for @GENE$ , but its high variability results in poor crossneutralization potency of @GENE$ across different @DISEASE$ isolates [ 86 ]	1
493	One well - described issue is decreased @GENE$ levels in patients with severe infection [ 6 ] as an element of the immunological response in the initial phase of inflammation in response to @DISEASE$ [ 7 ]	1
494	Although this treatment was omitted in recent @DISEASE$ guidelines due to a lack of supporting evidence in high - quality trials [ 8 ] , several studies , including one meta - analysis , describe beneficial effects of @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ induced by @DISEASE$ [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]	1
495	Furthermore , several case reports describe beneficial effects of antiviral therapy in combination with intravenous @GENE$ therapy in @DISEASE$ - compromised patients [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
496	Based on these data , we treated patients with @DISEASE$ requiring ECMO therapy with @GENE$ immediately after intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission	1
497	The objective of this study was to investigate whether intravenous @GENE$ administration could improve the clinical course of @DISEASE$ in patients treated with ECMO	1
498	We hypothesized that viruses influence bacterial selection in the URT leading to colonization of the @GENE$ and sometimes @DISEASE$	1
499	Although there are limitations in interpreting the results of experiments , evidence of numerous mechanisms observed under various conditions strongly suggest that viruses also play an important role in the selection of bacteria in the @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ etiology .	1
500	For example , administration of @GENE$ to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of @DISEASE$ , whereas antibody that neutralizes @GENE$ impairs CTL responses and clearance , thus leading to persistent infection [ 110 , 111 ]	1
501	Identification of cross - reactive @GENE$ should be a high priority of the @DISEASE$ community	1
502	In addition , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and CAV - 1 have been reported to influence the efficiency of viral infection and replication [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] ; @GENE$ is the key influencer for @DISEASE$ virus to enter cells 32 ; @GENE$ can inhibit the release of infectious viral progeny 33 ; and the down - regulation of @GENE$ is associated with the development of @GENE$ 	1
503	A macro dataset of 909 entries of @GENE$ from all @DISEASE$ has been obtained from Uniprot .	1
504	This view was directed by the facts that , for a long period , very few cases of clinical @DISEASE$ were described in cats as compared to dogs , and that Italy ( Imperia , Liguria ) @GENE$ [ 26 ] Italy ( Messina , Sicily ) MLEE [ 10 ] Italy ( Lipari island , Sicily ) @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 11 ] Switzerland a @GENE$ and sequencing [ 50 ] France ( Alpes - Maritimes ) MLEE [ 12 ] Spain ( Barcelona ) @GENE$ and sequencing [ 29 ] Spain ( Madrid community ) @GENE$ and sequencing [ 33 , 78 ] Spain a @GENE$ [ 68 ] Spain ( Mallorca ) b @GENE$ [ 95 ] Portugal ( Lisbon region ) @GENE$ and sequencing [ 96 , 97 ] Portugal ( Lisbon and Algarve regions ) @GENE$ and sequencing [ 98 ] Greece ( Thessaly and Macedonia ) @GENE$ and sequencing [ 99 ] Brazil ( Cotia , São Paulo state ) PCR and sequencing [ 100 ] Brazil ( Rio de Janeiro ) PCR and hybridization [ 101 ] Brazil [ 23 ] cats have also been considered more resistant to experimental infection [ 39 ]	1
505	@GENE$ is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype , is associated with @GENE$ expression , and could be an important therapeutic target in @DISEASE$ .	1
506	@GENE$ directed against the @GENE$ are thought to have a key role in protection against disease , an idea supported directly by passive antibody transfer experiments in animal models and indirectly by epidemiological data from prospective studies in geographical areas that are prone to @DISEASE$	1
507	3 , 7 , 8 Although immunisation of IFNAR − / − mice with the @GENE$ - prME DNA vaccine as well as serum transfer from immunised NHPs were protective in this murine model , the @GENE$ − / − vaccinated as opposed to serum - transferred mice exhibited greater control of @DISEASE$ loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis	1
508	For instance , the @GENE$ from @DISEASE$ that colocalizes and can be coimmunoprecipitated with @GENE$ when ectopically expressed in various @DISEASE$ cell lines	1
509	In cell culture , @GENE$ were tested against @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 66 , 67 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 67 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 67 ] , @DISEASE$ ( DENV ) [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] , @DISEASE$ ( SARS - CoV ) [ 71 ] , MHV [ 59 , 63 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 72 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 73 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 74 ] , poliovirus 1 ( PV1 ) [ 75 ] , human rhinovirus 14 [ 75 ] , coxsackievirus B2 [ 75 ] , coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) [ 76 ] , Sindbis virus [ 77 ] , @DISEASE$ ( VEEV ) [ 77 ] , EBOV [ 64 , 78 ] , @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) [ 79 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 80 ] , and @DISEASE$ ( FLUAV ) [ 81 , 82 ] .	1
510	Several studies reported that specific @GENE$ provide protection against @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 111 ]	1
511	Despite the effectiveness of this practice , we have not found in the recent literature ( last 5 years ) any studies evaluating the use of specific @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ control	1
512	This is probably the consequence of the non - profitability in pig production of this practice , or the lack of protection against @DISEASE$ challenge or @DISEASE$ occurrence , possibly because the @GENE$ contained in the eggs are not specific against the infected ETEC strains present on the farm [ 143 ] .	1
513	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( CSFV ) is involved in the RNA synthesis and viral replication	1
514	The presence of concurrent @DISEASE$ has also been an indication for feeding reduced or moderate fat diets in cats with @DISEASE$ ( 17 ) ; however , cats with increased @GENE$ levels were excluded from this study	1
515	@GENE$ reactivation has repeatedly been described as an important sign in @DISEASE$ , although it is not included in any of the diagnostic algorithms [ 14 , 15 ]	1
516	The unexpected finding of @GENE$ reactivation in our patient correctly raised the concern of a possible diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
517	In another study on @DISEASE$ infected marmosets , hybrid of ritonavir / lopinavir and @GENE$ had positive effect [ 66 ] .	1
518	Interrogation of related signaling pathways with the KEGG pathway tool revealed enrichment for " @DISEASE$ , " " @DISEASE$ , " " @DISEASE$ , " and " @GENE$ ( Table 5 )	1
519	In agreement with the GO and pathway results , the @GENE$ was enriched with higher order muscle phenotypes such as " @DISEASE$ , " " abnormal cardiac tissue morphology , " and " @DISEASE$ " ( Figure 3 )	1
520	Importantly , neither resolution of @DISEASE$ nor reduction in the @GENE$ levels was observed in the mice treated with LC16m8 , @GENE$ , or @GENE$	1
521	Therefore , it may be important to exclude the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) as @GENE$ when developing therapeutic vaccines against @DISEASE$ .	1
522	Our unbiased transcriptome analysis also indicated that other genes involved in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ and other @GENE$ , as well as @GENE$ are differentially expressed during @DISEASE$ infection , suggesting that this pathway has a critical role in the invertebrate response to infection and / or the viral host evasion strategy	1
523	Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any @DISEASE$ that could be associated with the clinical signs of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , and if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a @GENE$ fPL ≥ 5	1
524	Following infection of airway epithelial cells by @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , or severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , several @GENE$ are induced , including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ [UNK] ) , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( 28 ) ( 29 ) ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) ( 33 ) ( 34 ) ( 35 )	1
525	Results PGE 2 increases cell proliferation and phosphorylation and expression of @GENE$ in HBEc14 - KT and BEAS2B cells PGE 2 has been shown to stimulate @DISEASE$ cell proliferation [ 18 ]	1
526	The @GENE$ Net will facilitate cross - border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations and promote @DISEASE$ outbreaks , and will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host - virus dynamics in other taxa native to Western Asia , in particular known reservoirs of @DISEASE$ ( e	1
527	We strongly advocate a " bats for peace " mission for @GENE$ Net by promoting data sharing and a culture of meaningful transboundary scientific collaboration to develop a sustainable bat research network and serve as an instrument for the early detection of @DISEASE$ threats in this politically volatile region .	1
528	Primers used during qPCR for the detection and quantification of @DISEASE$ wing virus ( DWV ) and minus strand - specific PCR as a proxy for viral replication as well as the @GENE$ .	1

530	coli and closely related species , have been shown to inhibit the activities of ETEC : F4 and F18 strains in vitro and in vivo , and improve the growth performance , reduce the incidence of @DISEASE$ and the expression of the @GENE$ in ileal tissues of pigs [ 141 ]	1
531	In studies comparing the activity of various @GENE$ against murine @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 63 ] and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 64 ] , arginine - rich peptides with insertions of 6 - aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vi vo effectiveness	1
532	The higher the number of @GENE$ , the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [ 63 ] and the protection against @DISEASE$ infection in mice [ 64 ]	1
533	documented that the nature of the linker ( XB or cysteine ) did not affect @GENE$ in v itro effectiveness against @DISEASE$ or cytotoxicity , although the insertion of β - alanine residues was reported to improve both serum and intracellular stability of @GENE$ conjugates [ 65 ] .	1
534	Our literature searching strategy pinpointed several @GENE$ ; one of those was the @GENE$ from @DISEASE$	1
535	Studies have shown that @GENE$ from @DISEASE$ ( DENV - 2 ) colocalizes with @GENE$ and that DENV - 2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection	1
536	pneumoniae @GENE$ distribution , from PCR nasal swab or blood sample were not different in @DISEASE$ cases according to the result of urine antibiotic testing ( data not shown )	1
537	As a whole , our data imply that regulatory polymorphisms which alter expression levels of @GENE$ of this gene network ( such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) might predispose to @DISEASE$	1
538	This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of @GENE$ , one of our candidate @GENE$ , is increased in @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$ ( Deshmukh et al	1
539	2015 ) and a recent GWAS that has for the first time identified the @GENE$ as a susceptibility locus for @DISEASE$ in humans ( Christophersen et al	1
540	Further , genes within our gene network that are regulated by the @GENE$ containing @GENE$ are also dysregulated in @DISEASE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) ( Deshmukh et al	1
541	2015 ) and dysregulation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ could drive the switch from working myocardium to the pacemaker phenotype observed in the pulmonary myocardium in @DISEASE$ .	1
542	5 ) , indicating that @DISEASE$ infection may trigger biological processes of @GENE$ regulation .	1
543	Thus it may indicates that mutant 3D8 scFv with only intrinsic @GENE$ activity is not sufficient for providing a full protection for host cells against @DISEASE$ 1 infection once HSV - 1 DNA replication successfully takes places in nucleus in muSCH cells	1
544	Therefore , it may be possible that the antiviral effects of @GENE$ against @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ infection were contributed by both the @GENE$ activity , which is mainly effective in the nucleus and the @GENE$ activity mainly effective in the cytoplasm	1
545	1 % ( v / v ) NP - 40 detergent , the blots were incubated with @GENE$ ( Sino Biological , Beijing , China , 1 : 1000 ) , @GENE$ ( Sino Biological , 1 : 500 ) , or polyclonal sera from @DISEASE$ infected rabbits or cynomolgus macaques ( kindly provided by Dr	1
546	Because the ICIs observed in @DISEASE$ specimens are identified by @GENE$ synthesized from pathologic @DISEASE$ specimens , the authors of these studies conclude that these inclusions are of viral origin , and specifically related to the etiological agent of @DISEASE$ [ 51 , 105 ]	1
547	Available evidence suggests @DISEASE$ ICIs and @GENE$ are distinct structures since the ICIs observed in the two autopsy specimens lacked a @GENE$ cage [ 103 ]	1
548	It is possible the ICI identified by @GENE$ are one of these structures ; perhaps the manifestation of @DISEASE$ is the improper regulation of one of these processes .	1
549	Certain @DISEASE$ contain proteins that non - specifically bind @GENE$ causing a more generalized polyclonal expansion and inflammation , termed a superantigen effect	1
550	Polyclonality of @GENE$ usage has been shown in @DISEASE$ [ 47 , 48 ] ; however , the reports are variable as to which subset of @GENE$ are expanded [ 49 ]	1
551	Although @GENE$ was upregulated in a few samples , neither of the @DISEASE$ strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points , suggesting an impact of @DISEASE$ infection on the @GENE$ pathway response ( Fig	1
552	Interestingly , 48 to 72 hpi both @DISEASE$ strains induced a significant upregulation of @GENE$ in NEC , with higher gene expression in Laos - infected cells ( Fig	1
553	For @DISEASE$ virus , which lacks perfect primer - length conservation around the @GENE$ of interest , it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many @GENE$	1
554	This extended gene network contained a number of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) of interest in the context of @DISEASE$	1
555	The diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in the patient was confirmed by both @DISEASE$ virus isolation from the throat swab and also detection of @GENE$ s ( @GENE$ ) in the serum	1
556	Although the diagnosis is usually made based on the characteristic clinical manifestations , confirmation of @DISEASE$ may be obtained by detection of @GENE$ s in the serum , and also through @DISEASE$ virus identification from throat - swab and urine specimens [ 12 ] .	1
557	Stressors , such as @GENE$ responses and @DISEASE$ , can induce the expression of @GENE$ that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ]	1
558	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with @GENE$ [ 28 ]	1
559	@GENE$ also interacts with the @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( TGEV ) and regulates the virus replication [ 29 ]	1
560	Furthermore , @GENE$ can be utilized as the cofactors of the @GENE$ synthesis for several viruses , such as HIV - 1 [ 22 , 23 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 21 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 30 ]	1
561	Previous studies on @DISEASE$ ( TuMV ) , @DISEASE$ ( TMV ) and @DISEASE$ have shown that @GENE$ interacts primarily with the @GENE$ , and thus acts as a @GENE$ and supports viral replication [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]	1
562	Thereinto , the exact role of @GENE$ on the @DISEASE$ replication remains unclear [ 24 ]	1
563	@GENE$ , a @GENE$ , is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of @DISEASE$ - infected cells	1
564	A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that @GENE$ activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of @DISEASE$ patients [ 9 ]	1
565	Our findings that the @GENE$ has the ability to inhibit @GENE$ activity in human @DISEASE$ cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation .	1
566	As part of routine @DISEASE$ surveillance in California , the VRDL genotypes rabies - positive samples received from local public health laboratories by RT - PCR and performs sequence analysis on @GENE$ using @GENE$ 1066 deg 59 - GARAGAAGATTCTTCAGRGA - 39 and @GENE$ targeting a portion of the @GENE$ as described in Trimarchi and Smith ( 2002 ) and Velasco - Villa , et al	1
567	To assess how @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion affects endogenous SR T cells during @DISEASE$ persistence , we chose DEREG mice , which express the @GENE$ under the control of the @GENE$ ( 22 )	1
568	Incomplete DT - mediated @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effects of @GENE$ + @GENE$ ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of @DISEASE$ and systemic lethal @DISEASE$ ( 23 , 24 )	1
569	DT treatment of @DISEASE$ - infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration ( between days 21 and 28 post infection ) , resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN , coincident with elevated @GENE$ expression compared to DT - treated controls	1
570	The apparent redundant role of @GENE$ in regulating @DISEASE$ implied a potential protective function of Tr1 cells	1
571	Analysis of SR T cells during @DISEASE$ of @GENE$ − / − mice , which lack Tr1 cells , revealed no effects within the CLN	1
572	Microglial depletion via @GENE$ inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of @DISEASE$ , but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of @DISEASE$ by unknown mechanisms	1
573	Methods : The impact of @GENE$ signaling during @DISEASE$ was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of @DISEASE$	1
574	Pharmacological inactivation of @GENE$ was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , an emerging neuropathogen	1
575	Results : Mice treated with @GENE$ antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal @DISEASE$ and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery	1
576	We sought to determine the role of @GENE$ signaling in viral clearance of both @DISEASE$	1
577	In addition , the clinical finding of @GENE$ reactivation is regarded to be highly specific for @DISEASE$ , as it is very rarely described in other febrile illnesses or infections	1
578	For example , in a study of febrile Japanese children aged < 2 years admitted over an 8month period with diagnoses other than @DISEASE$ , no @GENE$ reactivations were observed [ 8 ]	1
579	In contrast , data from a Japanese nationwide epidemiologic survey showed that > 70 % of children in this age group who were diagnosed with @DISEASE$ developed @GENE$ reactivation [ 8 ]	1
580	@DISEASE$ has not been reported to cause @GENE$ reactivation .	1
581	Altogether , our data highlight the promising potential of @GENE$ to induce a preventive antiviral state in the cat and to protect feline populations against a broad range of @DISEASE$ infections .	1
582	Virus - infected HeLa cells express @GENE$ in the cytoplasm after @DISEASE$ infection [ 30 ] and PRV infection results in @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in HeLa cells	1
583	Interestingly , although one human genetic study found no association between @GENE$ mutations and @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( Kushima et al	1
584	, 2010 ) , another study identified @GENE$ as a candidate gene associated with early - onset @DISEASE$ ( Liu et al	1
585	It will be interesting to learn if mutations in @GENE$ or its regulators are associated with other @DISEASE$ given the importance of @GENE$ in both glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling .	1
586	To explore possible transmission routes of this bacterial pathogen , we also test for associations between bat fly infestation and @DISEASE$ infection status , which would support vector - borne transmission , and by screening bat saliva and fecal samples for evidence of @GENE$ , which would support transmission through bites or grooming and environmental exposure to bacteria shed in feces , respectively .	1
587	There was a modest but significant positive correlation between the degree of BAL @DISEASE$ and the @GENE$ E$ II score ( r = 0	1
588	In both coronaand togaviruses , disruption of @GENE$ has been shown to reduce virulence [ 20 , 21 ] , and in the case of @DISEASE$ , this reduced virulence is due to increased sensitivity to the antiviral activity of interferon ( @GENE$ ) [ 21 ]	1
589	Next , a rate - limiting role for @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ has been reported [ 106 ]	1
590	The finding that @GENE$ from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids obtained from @DISEASE$ - infected individuals mediate enhanced transcytosis of infectious virus further suggests the biological relevance of our results	1
591	5 mg / ml of total @GENE$ , well below total @GENE$ concentrations found in genital secretions of @DISEASE$ men and women [ 18 ]	1
592	Even during @DISEASE$ , when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest , 23 of 23 subjects ( 100 % ) were reported to have @GENE$ and 40 % had @GENE$ in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids [ 17 ]	1
593	The dysregulation of these @GENE$ in atrial tissue of patients with @DISEASE$ , especially @GENE$ which we propose acts upstream of many of the genes in our network , highlights the need for similar gene expression studies to be performed with pulmonary myocardium tissue .	1
594	@GENE$ , a @GENE$ and Q05JH9H9N2 , a NA of the distantly related @DISEASE$ virus have been used as members of an outlier group for the phyloinformatics analysis .	1
595	It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance , and protects pigs against @DISEASE$ infection by reducing the intestinal expression of @GENE$ such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ and maintaining mucosal integrity , and enhancing specific antibody defense [ 111 ]	1
596	Methods : @DISEASE$ patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) who were placed on ECMO and treated with ( IVIG group ; n = 29 ) or without ( control group ; n = 28 ) intravenous @GENE$ for 3 days in the initial stages of @DISEASE$ were analyzed retrospectively .	1
597	Exposure to the MERS - 0 infectious clone ( icMERS - 0 ) strain in Rhesus monkeys is reported to cause @DISEASE$ , wherein @GENE$ has been detected	1
598	However , it cannot be predicted if additional types of @GENE$ or new variants of known types will emerge which could bind to yet unidentified receptors and could cause outbreaks of @DISEASE$ and mortality in the nursery [ 2 ]	1
599	In addition to augmenting antiviral T cell activation , many @GENE$ have essential protective roles during @DISEASE$	1
600	Microglia become activated in response to neurotropic @DISEASE$ and upregulate expression of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ [ 18 ]	1
601	Neurons and astrocytes in @DISEASE$ - infected brains also release proinflammatory mediators including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , which promote lymphocyte trafficking to the CNS [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
602	In fact , results from a recent study demonstrated that peripheral infection with @DISEASE$ increased CNS expression of @GENE$ important for lymphocyte trafficking , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice [ 61 ]	1
603	Mice lacking @GENE$ signaling are highly vulnerable to uncontrolled @DISEASE$ replication , exhibiting 100 % mortality [ 68 ]	1
604	Clearance of @DISEASE$ infections , however , requires additional immune response including @GENE$ , i	1
605	On binding bronchial epithelium specimens from children with @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ identified intracellular inclusions ( ICI ) [ 51 , 57 ]	1
606	2D , we visualized @DISEASE$ infection of NEC by labeling of virus ( @GENE$ , green ) , nuclei ( 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride [ DAPI ] , dark blue ) , tight junctions ( @GENE$ , light blue ) , and cilia ( @GENE$ , red )	1
607	To investigate the pattern of relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) without the influence of amino acid composition among all @DISEASE$ samples , the RSCU values of @GENE$ in each ORF of polioviruses were calculated according to the formula of previous reports [ 22 , 23 ] .	1
608	While the detection of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ brains supports a role for viral infections in triggering @DISEASE$ ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) , the " hygiene hypothesis " rather proposes a protective function ( 6 , 7 ) , underlining the ambiguous link between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( 8 )	1
609	As a proof of concept , the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 isolates ( micro level ) and @DISEASE$ viruses ( macro level )	1
610	Results : We observed that heterologous expression of the @GENE$ in human @DISEASE$ cells led to stabilization of the cellular @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) pool , with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the @GENE$ subunit of @GENE$ and inhibition of @GENE$ activity	1
611	A possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of @GENE$ enters the @DISEASE$ following treatment with DIs and this does not reduce the overall level of @GENE$ that remains non - ubiquitinated	1
612	In recent years it has been well established that two major constituent parts of the @GENE$ system ( UPS ) - the @GENE$ and a number of @GENE$ - play a crucial role , not only in virus replication but also in the regulation of the immunogenicity of @DISEASE$ ( HIV - 1 )	1
613	However , in explants from @DISEASE$ women with low or undetectable @GENE$ , virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact , uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer	1
614	The @GENE$ data from cases analysed from a third country with contemporaneous @DISEASE$ outbreaks showed that the NZ FPV strains segregated with @DISEASE$ vaccine viruses	1
615	The current therapy against @DISEASE$ , consisting of a combination of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and ribavirin ( RBV ) , is limited by resistance , adverse effects , and high costs	1
616	Moreover , accelerated progression to @DISEASE$ after graft reinfection and limited efficacy of @GENE$ - based therapies for recurrent @DISEASE$ are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the @DISEASE$ recipients [ 80 ]	1
617	The most prevalent serotype in @DISEASE$ cases and controls was @GENE$ 6A / B ( 18	1
618	While there are no reports of metabolic assessment of @DISEASE$ infections , @DISEASE$ virus ( RVFV ) modulates the activity of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in infected cells	1
619	In conclusion , the data indicate that cellular analysis of BAL fluid , alone or in combination with @GENE$ and @GENE$ concentrations , may rapidly provide valuable diagnostic information for the early differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in critically ill adult patients .	1
620	Comparison of @DISEASE$ patients with @GENE$ between the post - pandemic seasons showed that median age was 1	1
621	Using a mouse model of @DISEASE$ , we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus ( rVV ) that encodes an @GENE$	1
622	The @GENE$ was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid - polycytidylic acid injection , and these mice showed @DISEASE$ - related pathological findings ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
623	Immunization with one rVV strain ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded @GENE$ , suppressed serum @GENE$ levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological @DISEASE$ within 7 days after injection	1
624	We also demonstrated that the onset of @DISEASE$ in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice was mainly attributable to @GENE$ , @GENE$ - a and ( @GENE$	1
625	Fecal examination included wet smear and zinc sulfate centrifugation flotation and a feline @DISEASE$ PCR panel to detect Campylobacter coli , Campylobacter jejuni , @GENE$ , Cryptosporidium spp	1
626	Cats were also excluded if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a @GENE$ ≥ 5	1
627	Based on a later observation that this newly sequenced @GENE$ me could differ by approximately 9 % relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox @DISEASE$ sequence , we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9 % of the control reference sequence , however , no noticeable increase in error rates were observed , suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence	1
628	DNA - based molecular detection methods such multiplex PCR based on the detection of @GENE$ are rapidly becoming part of the routine laboratory diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , and these genes are used as a biomarkers of ETEC strain [ 7 , 58 ] .	1
629	The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ strains was directly related to the base composition	1
630	Macrophages release @GENE$ and @GENE$ such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ upon @DISEASE$ infection [ 37 ]	1
631	Similarly , @DISEASE$ infection in blood monocyte - derived macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the release of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , for example , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 37 , 48 ]	1
632	However , in mice lacking either CD4 or CD8 T - cells , the pathological changes associated with @DISEASE$ were resolved following @GENE$ immunization , and the @DISEASE$ score of @GENE$ - N25 - treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice ( Figures 4C - E )	1
633	62 - fold between the highest and lowest expressing @DISEASE$ strains ( Figure 2B ) , such that a significant trans eQTL could be mapped to @GENE$ : 33 6 1 Mb ( Figure 2C )	1
634	Abbreviations @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; BID : bis in die ( twice a day ) ; CanL : @DISEASE$ ; DAT : direct agglutination test ; ELISA : enzyme - linked	1
635	Transgenic mice that express @GENE$ have been generated to study HCV expression [ 3 , 4 ] ; however , in each of these cases , the relevant transgenes is expressed during embryonic development ; therefore , the transgenic mice become immunotolerant to the transgenic products , and consequently , the adult mice are not useful for investigations of the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$	1
636	Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of @GENE$ could induce immune responses [ 5 ] and , therefore , obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on @DISEASE$	1
637	The objective of this study was to screen for antigens of the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) to establish a new double antibody sandwich - lateral flow immunoassay ( DAS - LFIA ) method for testing the presence of @GENE$ in human serum or plasma	1
638	The authors also tested @GENE$ PPMO in a mouse model of ocular @DISEASE$	1
639	The potential ability of a single immunisation with the @GENE$ - prME DNA vaccine to protect @GENE$ − / − mice from @DISEASE$ challenge was evaluated	1
640	Finally , in order to provide a global perspective of the molecular evolution of @GENE$ , the dataset of 909 sequences of @DISEASE$ viruses rather than @GENE$ alone has been utilized	1
641	Numerous studies now indicate that polymorphisms in genes encoding the cardiac transcription factors @GENE$ and @GENE$ increase susceptibility to @DISEASE$ ( Huang et al	1
642	By correlating variation in gene expression and known @DISEASE$ genotypes in a genome - wide eQTL analysis we identified three @GENE$ associated with the expression of a @GENE$ in the pulmonary myocardium .	1
643	The results showed that the identified @GENE$ mediated HCV entry by regulating @GENE$ associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion , implying that inhibition of @GENE$ function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$ .	1
644	Indeed , after the initial discovery that @GENE$ was highly expressed in aggressive @DISEASE$ [ 61 ] , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were shown to regulate expression of several @GENE$ [ 50 , 62 ]	1
645	Such viral antagonism could not only inform us of the role for @GENE$ in the cells , but could also be used as a guide to devise useful interventions for treatment of the aggressive @DISEASE$ that are associated with high @GENE$ expression	1
646	Initially , conventional @GENE$ - based therapy was used to treat recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
647	Three recent systematic reviews demonstrated 20 - 40 % of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50 - 100 % in genotype 2 / 3 subjects using Pegylated @GENE$ - based therapy for recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]	1
648	@DISEASE$ is another poor predictor , and it is almost incurable with @GENE$ treatment when @DISEASE$ develops [ 75 ]	1
649	The protein @GENE$ from @DISEASE$ virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes	1
650	In contrast , little to no @GENE$ was observed in @DISEASE$ , and expression occurred only in the basal epithelial layer ( Figure 5C and 5F ; Figure S7C )	1
651	Sequencing of the @GENE$ products confirmed the identity of both @DISEASE$ strains found in M	1
652	Here , we used PLX5622 in a model of @DISEASE$ to examine the effect of @GENE$ antagonism in the setting of @DISEASE$	1
653	Abbreviations @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; KD : @DISEASE$ 	1
654	Development of @GENE$ against emerging @DISEASE$ requires a significant production cost and poses as a major drawback	1
655	Having shown the important role of @GENE$ in PGE 2related @DISEASE$ proliferation , we further investigated whether the PGE 2 - mediated up - regulation of @GENE$ reflected transactivation of the gene	1
656	@DISEASE$ damage in this MIA model and the effect of maternal H 2 administration on this damage can be summarized as follows 12 : ( 1 ) high mortality rate of @DISEASE$ fetuses , ( 2 ) @DISEASE$ associated with elevated levels of @GENE$ , aberrant microglial activation , and oxidative damage in the MIA fetal brains , and ( 3 ) attenuation of these adverse outcomes by maternal H 2 administration	1
657	However , when astrocytes are exposed to @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ models , they secrete various @GENE$ that lead to neurodevelopmental impairments 23	1
658	Of the two closely related @GENE$ , one ( @GENE$ _ 260 ) was from a 10 - week - old kitten vaccinated 4 days before with the same vaccine strain , which presented for @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
659	The other ( FPV _ 254 ) was from an unvaccinated stray 8 - month - old cat that presented with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ and tested positive on a faecal @GENE$ test	1
660	Recently , the B cell marker @GENE$ + was used to show an increase in both number of B cells and relative percentage in @DISEASE$ compared to controls	1
661	However , these studies have mainly been targeted against @GENE$ from the @DISEASE$ virus	1
662	We also show that @GENE$ ( orthologous to @GENE$ ) is induced by @DISEASE$ infection and blocks Jak @GENE$ signalling , increasing @DISEASE$ replication .	1
663	To determine whether @GENE$ treatment induced the same effect in other strains of HCV transgenic mice , we analyzed RzCN5 - 15 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , which express all @GENE$ ; in these mice , @DISEASE$ was resolved within 28 days of immunization with rVV - N25	1
664	Recently , @GENE$ , which is induced in mosquitoes in response to @DISEASE$ infection , was found to be functionally similar to @GENE$ in that it is activated via the TRAF @GENE$ pathway and , upon secretion , activates the Jak @GENE$ pathway and an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [ 7 , 35 ]	1
665	Our results here suggest that @GENE$ is regulated by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which has proviral activity during @DISEASE$ infection , and that WNV may target @GENE$ for degradation by inducing @GENE$ via @GENE$ and @GENE$ proteins	1
666	Primarily the @DISEASE$ virus interacts with the host @GENE$ through its @GENE$ after entering the respiratory tract	1
667	Recent findings have suggested that a prior existing @DISEASE$ might increase the chances of such individuals contracting @DISEASE$ , as @DISEASE$ results in enhanced @GENE$ expression [ 40 ] .	1
668	Changes in the duodenum were similar to but more severe than those described above in case 221 , including @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and the presence within epithelial cells of intranuclear inclusion bodies which variably marginated the @GENE$	1
669	The application of @GENE$ to control various @DISEASE$ was reported [ 39 , 40 ]	1
670	With the exception of the acute phase prior to development of anti - HIV - 1 immune responses , semen , cervicovaginal , and rectal fluids from @DISEASE$ - infected individuals contain @GENE$ against @GENE$ [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]	1
671	We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of @GENE$ in different populations of H5N1 in particular and in @DISEASE$ in general	1
672	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ infection in cat populations is commonly estimated by detection of @GENE$ , and DNA amplification by PCR [ 21 ]	1
673	For example , HSV1 protein @GENE$ binds to @GENE$ and inhibits autophagosome formation and @DISEASE$ ( KSHV ) and murine γ - herpesvirus ( MHV - 68 ) encode @GENE$ homologues to bind to and inhibit @GENE$ [ 26 , 31 , 32 ]	1
674	We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated @DISEASE$ cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor @GENE$ / EP4 - mediated kinase signaling pathways	1
675	We evaluated the effects of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in mediating @DISEASE$ induced by PGE 2 .	1
676	In @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ is widely over - expressed on the surface of a number of different cell types , ranging from endothelial cells to @DISEASE$ cells	1
677	As a result of its role in @DISEASE$ development and @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ has been a major target for drug development	1
678	Although bestatin inhibits nearly a dozen @GENE$ , it has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
679	They have shown considerable nucleotide diversity among circulating strains , given clear evidence for adaptive selection of antigenic variants [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] , and have shown that most of the major innovations within the @GENE$ enome have occurred via reassortment [ 5 ] , by which one @DISEASE$ strain has recombined with another strain and obtained a segment of RNA from the second strain .	1
680	No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived @DISEASE$ ( DVPVs ) , wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the @GENE$	1
681	As demonstrated recently , intrarectally applied @GENE$ , but less so the @GENE$ version , prevented @DISEASE$ following intrarectal challenge [ 40 ]	1
682	Another study showed that , compared to irrelevant - and no - antibody controls , there was an increase in the number of transmitted / founder @DISEASE$ variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a @GENE$ [ 55 ]	1
683	Clearly , other studies have found that @GENE$ with neutralizing activity can prevent @DISEASE$ after vaginal challenge [ 56 , 57 ]	1
684	where L r p I ð Þ À is the average relative likelihood ; S is the total number of the divided groups ; N s is the total number of susceptible people in the @DISEASE$ group ; L r p I ; s À is the relative likelihood of the sth group ; @GENE$ I ; s À is the average infection risk of the sth group ; and n s is number of infected people in the sth group .	1
685	This indicated that the @GENE$ tigen did not cross - react with other common @GENE$ and thus , was highly specific to @DISEASE$ .	1
686	In this study , we identified adverse events after antipyretics administration , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and elevated @GENE$ , which were commonly observed in the Adv group patients ( P = 0	1
687	In addition , recent study demonstrated that a @GENE$ targeting @GENE$ efficiently precluded @DISEASE$ infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [ 115 ]	1
688	Recently , @GENE$ inhibiting @DISEASE$ infection in vitro have been developed [ 116 ]	1
689	The @GENE$ has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum - derived HCV into @DISEASE$ HepG2 cells by binding virus - LDL particles [ 101 ]	1
690	Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of @GENE$ on myeloid cells - 1 ( @GENE$ ) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilateral @DISEASE$ infiltrates	1
691	It has generally been assumed that any non - neutral mutations within the @GENE$ have arisen as selective adaptations and generally help drive @DISEASE$ toward a stronger and more dangerous pathogen ( in terms of either pathenogenicity or transmissibility ) [ 41 ]	1
692	Although plasma cell infiltration as outlined above is intriguing , a similar pathological response is seen in a number of @DISEASE$ conditions such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) @DISEASE$ [ 85 ] , @DISEASE$ , [ 86 ] @DISEASE$ , [ 87 ] and responses to @DISEASE$ [ 88 ]	1
693	Some , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have shown plasma cell infiltration and @GENE$ staining [ 89 ]	1
694	Therefore , @GENE$ have recently emerged as a prominent target for the treatment of @DISEASE$ ( Nguyen et al	1
695	The latest studies on sequelae of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial @GENE$ ( Rittirsch et al	1
696	aeruginosa showed that @GENE$ acts in the initial stages of @DISEASE$ by targeting glycoconjugates and biofilm production ( Soong et al	1
697	The impact of @GENE$ antagonism on @GENE$ and @GENE$ expression appears to be tissuedependent as the blood showed no difference in @DISEASE$ expressing @GENE$ and the pLN showed no difference in @DISEASE$ expressing @GENE$ ( Additional file 7 )	1
698	Together , these data indicate that @GENE$ antagonism decreases the expression of @GENE$ on peripheral @DISEASE$ populations	1
699	By blocking the deubiquitination of @GENE$ , the DIs P22077 and @GENE$ should also increase steady state levels of @GENE$ and thus its entry into the @DISEASE$	1
700	In our previous studies , we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of @GENE$ on @GENE$ at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of @GENE$ into the @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 32 , 48 , 67 ]	1
701	Finally , excessive inflammation in the lungs due to virus - initiated exacerbation of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , can cause tissue damage [ 6 ] , which increases susceptibility to secondary @DISEASE$ .	1
702	Among the currently available inflammatory markers , @GENE$ is one of the best indicators of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
703	The usefulness of @GENE$ measurements has been validated in the diagnosis , severity assessment , and follow - up of patients with @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
704	In the current study , the AUC of @GENE$ concentration for predicting @DISEASE$ ( AUC = 0	1
705	The two major human @DISEASE$ pandemics since 1918 did not arise due to mutations within @GENE$ , but arose via horizontal transmission of new genetic material from bird influenza strains , creating recombinant viruses	1
706	Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with @DISEASE$ resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of @GENE$ , indicating infection and replication in macrophages	1
707	Moreover , macrophages stimulated by @GENE$ , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , were more permissive to the @DISEASE$ infection	1
708	@GENE$ Interacts with the @GENE$ and Inhibits the Growth of @DISEASE$ Virus	1
709	A previous study has shown that CPV2 @GENE$ can lead to regression of @DISEASE$ in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14	1
710	Moreover , the @GENE$ shows anti - tumour activity in a mouse @DISEASE$ model , and it further stimulates the immune cells to attack the @DISEASE$ 15 .	1
711	1 @GENE$ antagonism reduces circulating @DISEASE$ populations in uninfected mice	1
712	The entire @GENE$ of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 was amplified from 113 suspected cases of @DISEASE$ , comprising 93 from Australia , 11 from Dubai and 9 from New Zealand	1
713	All @GENE$ in this study were identified as FPV , with no cases attributed to @DISEASE$	1
714	The purpose of this study was to analyze @GENE$ levels using @GENE$ in normal controls , as well as patients with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ , and to verify those results using western blotting	1
715	The ultimate aim was to identify the differences in @GENE$ levels that were closely associated with the progression of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$	1
716	The @GENE$ aims to fill a critical need to facilitate interaction : ( 1 ) among bat researchers scattered throughout Western Asia , and ( 2 ) between bat conservationists and those conducting @DISEASE$ surveillance within the region	1
717	Quantitative trait locus mapping of the @DISEASE$ mice identified a 3bp deletion in a conserved lysine ( K92 ) in @GENE$	1
718	Importantly , @GENE$ knock - out ( KO ) mice exhibit similar changes in @DISEASE$ ( Imai et al	1
719	, 2013 ) and broad expression of a @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ mice rescued these behaviors ( Tomida et al	1
720	@GENE$ has been shown to a target molecule in @DISEASE$ cell proliferation [ 19 ]	1
721	In mice lacking receptors for @GENE$ ( designated @GENE$ − / − ) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced , following in vivo viral challenge , 100 % protection against infection - associated @DISEASE$ or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue	1
722	This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for @DISEASE$ control and disease prevention in humans .	1
723	14 Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic @GENE$ vaccine delivered by electroporation for its immunogenicity and its impact on @DISEASE$ in a pathogenic animal challenge model	1
724	Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization with @GENE$ revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with @DISEASE$ - including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( Figures 2C - E )	1
725	Collectively , these results demonstrated that only the @GENE$ treatment resulted in histological changes indicative of improvement in the @DISEASE$ suffered by the transgenic mice .	1
726	We used an unbiased transcriptome sequencing approach to identify @GENE$ differentially regulated after @DISEASE$ infection resulting in 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways	1
727	Several @DISEASE$ limit the activity of @GENE$ by targeting @GENE$ for ubiquitylation and degradation via interaction of their @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 29 , 30 ] .	1
728	The mechanism leading to the @GENE$ reactivation in our patient with @DISEASE$ is not known	1
729	This mechanism is , however , unlikely in our patient in view of the rapid onset and resolution of the @GENE$ EASE$ / @DISEASE$ with the appearance and resolution of the @DISEASE$	1
730	Cross - reactivity between specific epitopes of @GENE$ and human heat shock proteins ( @GENE$ ) , in particular @GENE$ and human homologue @GENE$ , have been postulated as the cause of @GENE$ reactivation in children with @DISEASE$ [ 22 , 23 ]	1
731	Synthesis of @GENE$ are increased during conditions of cellular stress , including infection , @DISEASE$ and other physical stresses	1
732	In humans , increased production and serum concentrations of @GENE$ , especially @GENE$ , have been reported during @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 25 , 26 ]	1
733	As homology between @GENE$ and @GENE$ have been demonstrated [ 27 ] , a similar cross - reactivity as thought to occur in children with @DISEASE$ could possibly also explain the @GENE$ reactivation in our patient	1
734	@GENE$ has emerged as important @GENE$ in aggressive @DISEASE$	1
735	Others : Several studies have documented a significant improvement of weight gain , and feed conversion , as well as the reduction of the incidence , severity and duration of @DISEASE$ in weaned pigs fed diets supplemented with substances such as : @GENE$ [ 147 ] , milk products [ 148 ] , clay minerals [ 149 ] , and medicinal plants [ 150 ]	1
736	rhamnosus , was effective in reducing @DISEASE$ in experimental ETEC : @DISEASE$ in pigs , possibly via the modulation of the intestinal microbiota , enhancement of intestinal antibody defense , and regulation of production of @GENE$ [ 128 ]	1
737	Therewith , our data suggest a new role of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in mediating @DISEASE$ induced by PGE 2 .	1
738	Cleaving after neutral amino acids , as implied by the " N " in its name , @GENE$ degrades peptides that are involved in different physiological pathways , including @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ by inactivating enkephalin , as well as regulating blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin III 1 , 5	1
739	Independent of its enzymatic activity , @GENE$ can also act a receptor for @DISEASE$ infection and as an @GENE$ .	1
740	Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during @DISEASE$ infection , all studies did indicate that @GENE$ became punctate upon coronavirus infection , suggesting an induction of autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 ] .	1
741	We found that the combination of acidic pH and @GENE$ , including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals , augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20 - fold compared with @GENE$ at neutral pH or @GENE$ at either pH	1
742	@GENE$ has also been found to be strongly induced in the brains of @DISEASE$ infected Peromyscus lecuopus , which are known as a natural host of the virus [ 104 ]	1
743	Similarly , @GENE$ was found to be induced in sheep infected with LIV [ 105 ] , and @GENE$ were induced in brains of @DISEASE$ infected mice , indicating an activated @GENE$ response [ 106 ] .	1
744	During @DISEASE$ , virally infected cells secrete @GENE$ including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , which facilitate immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
745	CD4 + T cells produce @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ , which promotes antiviral humoral immunity and sustains @DISEASE$ - specific CD8 + T cell responses , enabling viral clearance in all organs [ 27 , 28 ]	1
746	The lower limit of detection of faecal antigen tests for @DISEASE$ in dogs is 10 5 to 10 6 @GENE$ copies per mg of faeces [ 32 ]	1
747	Immunization with a Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Encodes @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ Virus Suppresses Viral Protein Levels in Mouse Liver	1
748	Female genital tract secretions are often acidic , and the secretions of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals have @GENE$ capable of coating virus contained in those secretions	1
749	@DISEASE$ virus was isolated from the throat swab and @GENE$ s ( @GENE$ ) were present in the serum	1
750	52 , 62 Other @GENE$ listed in ViralZone as being related to inhibition of the autophagy process are the neurovirulence factor @GENE$ and @GENE$ from human @DISEASE$ , the protein @GENE$ from HIV - 1 , and the protein @GENE$ from human @DISEASE$	1
751	Expression of @GENE$ can be detected in as little as a few days that suggests innate and adaptive immune activation , but the magnitude of expression is substantially less than in @DISEASE$ pathology models	1
752	While @GENE$ expression has been evaluated in @DISEASE$ - infected human endothelial cells , epithelial cells and macrophages [ 100 , 101 ] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of @GENE$ in reservoir host cells infected with @DISEASE$	1
753	However , other viruses , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , have evolved their own @GENE$ to either cleave ADP - ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , in order to overcome the effects of the @GENE$	1
754	In fact , as reviewed in this paper , many novel inhibitors or @GENE$ targeting @GENE$ and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat @DISEASE$	1
755	Although not included in the current study , @GENE$ in BAL fluid is another notable biomarker for the diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
756	@GENE$ is reportedly a potent discriminator of @DISEASE$ from non - infectious lung infiltrations [ 12 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]	1
757	Studies on BAL fluid @GENE$ have mainly been confined to patients with @DISEASE$	1
758	Therefore , the usefulness of @GENE$ for etiologic diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , especially differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , has not been elucidated yet	1
759	The current study directly compared patients with @DISEASE$ , and therefore differs from previous studies of @GENE$	1
760	@GENE$ catalyzes the removal of a terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates and plays a pivotal role in nutrition , cellular interactions and pathogenesis mediating various @DISEASE$ including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
761	An array of antiviral @GENE$ agents have been developed and are commercially available , such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating @DISEASE$	1
762	Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation , researchers have attempted to use @GENE$ antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function , including @DISEASE$ [ 38 , 39 ] , brain irradiation [ 50 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 76 ] , experimental @DISEASE$ [ 40 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 41 ]	1
763	However , our results indicate that @GENE$ antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS , as well as decreased peripheral @DISEASE$ activation	1
764	Detailed pathological studies have revealed what are termed oligoclonal plasma cell infiltrates in @DISEASE$ arterial specimens [ 101 ] , leading to the cloning of @GENE$ and association with the presence of the @GENE$ as previously discussed [ 102 , 103 ] .	1
765	In case of @DISEASE$ A H1N1 09 ( ' swine flu ' ) serotype , in addition to @GENE$ , the presence of the @GENE$ as well as the @GENE$ general signal was required to mark a sample as positive for @GENE$	1
766	The detected ' @DISEASE$ flu ' positive samples were subjected to sequencing by cloning and subsequent sequencing for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ , @GENE$ genes to confirm viral diagnosis	1
767	Consequently , @GENE$ , the most effective @GENE$ was developed that targeted @GENE$ , and successfully neutralized @DISEASE$ infection in Vero E6 , Huh - 7 and Calu - 3 cells [ 76 ]	1
768	The efficacy of @GENE$ against @DISEASE$ infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al	1
769	They were able to completely treat @DISEASE$ infection of lethal nature with a single dose of @GENE$ in the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [ 79 ] .	1
770	The intracellular levels of @GENE$ increased over time during spreading @DISEASE$ , in agreement with the upregulation of an @GENE$ transcriptional program described in a number of previous studies ( [ [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] ) , although not all ( [ 37 ] )	1
771	When compared to their effect on other viruses , as for example @DISEASE$ , @GENE$ display a milder antiviral phenotype against HIV - 1 ex vivo	1
772	In this respect , it will be of interest to determine whether multiple primary HIV - 1 strains display distinct susceptibilities to IFITMs and whether particular @GENE$ haplotypes can be associated to distinct HIV - 1 outcomes , as is the case for @DISEASE$ [ 13 ] .	1
773	@GENE$ are a vital means of protection to infants against @DISEASE$ as they have a relatively immature immune system to mount an effective immune response	1
774	We report the rare finding of @GENE$ reactivation in a child with confirmed @DISEASE$	1
775	Although @GENE$ reactivation is known to be an extremely important and highly specific clinical manifestation of @DISEASE$ , this case suggests that @GENE$ reactivation may also occur in other childhood diseases or infections	1
776	Using LC16m8 , a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus ( VV ) , we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses ( rVVs ) that each encoded one of three different @GENE$ and found that one recombinant virus ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded @GENE$ , resolved pathological @DISEASE$ symptoms in the liver	1
777	A throat swab and urine sample for @DISEASE$ virus isolation , as well as serum for @GENE$ s were sent to the regional laboratory .	1
778	Inclusion criteria for cases of @DISEASE$ were ( i ) clinical signs typical of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ ) and a positive confirmatory test ( faecal @GENE$ antigen test or PCR ) or ( ii ) clinical signs typical of @DISEASE$ in a cat from a shelter with a confirmed contemporaneous outbreak of @DISEASE$ .	1
779	Moreover , ZIKV does not possess the @GENE$ , and the @GENE$ ( equivalent to the @GENE$ in dengue ) is absent in some of the isolated @DISEASE$ strains	1
780	In our study , about two - thirds of @DISEASE$ cases and all fatalities were @GENE$ - associated	1
781	This observation suggests that @GENE$ may be associated more often with a severe course of @DISEASE$ requiring PICU treatment than other influenza types / subtypes	1
782	Similar observations on the proportion of @GENE$ ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated @DISEASE$ admissions have been reported in the United States [ 9 ] .	1
783	In this study , we utilised an @GENE$ - labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by @DISEASE$ infection	1
784	Additionally , @GENE$ - Net has formed an initial Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB ) to help guide and oversee the network , comprised of a group of global experts with backgrounds in bat ecology and conservation , virology and laboratory diagnostics , and @DISEASE$ disease ecology	1
785	To score the degree of @DISEASE$ , 5 = severe RNA was extracted from the brain , spinal cord , and muscles of 5746 - infected 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice treated with N3 or @GENE$ , and antibody - untreated mice as described in Fig	1
786	4 Mb interval was @GENE$ which is expressed in endothelial cells , heart , and highly n Table 6 The @GENE$ contains genes involved in ion transport that are associated with @DISEASE$ and dysregulated in atrial vascularized tissues including the lung ( Zimmermann et al	1
787	One of these agents , a cyclic version of the NGR peptide complexed to the @GENE$ pha , is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials in @DISEASE$ .	1
788	One of these downstream proteins is @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and is thought to be essential for the development of @DISEASE$	1
789	@GENE$ mediates the bidirectional transcytosis of @GENE$ , and in immunized individuals , could provide a conduit for @GENE$ to neutralize virus as shown for @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
