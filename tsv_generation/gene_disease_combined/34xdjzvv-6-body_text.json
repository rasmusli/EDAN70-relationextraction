The viral genomes in infected 3T3 - SCARB2 cells were detected by RT - PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to VP1 sequence of P1 transcripts of E59 or 5746 isolates . The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of P1 of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner . The quantities of the expressed P1 , compared to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were shown in a bar graph in Fig . 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 294}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 460}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 627, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 711}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
