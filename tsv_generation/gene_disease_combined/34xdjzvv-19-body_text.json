Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity . We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope ( 210 - 225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776 - 790 encoded residues of EV71 genome ; [ 17 ] ) . In comparison of the recent study [ 37 ] , alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid ( 200 - 225 ) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71 , which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross - neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence . The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report ' s epitopes ; the mouse anti - sera generated from the peptides , P230 - 323 , P646 - 755 , P857 - 1012 and P1329 - 1440 , showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla . N3 only closely met with the peptide P746 - 876 which elicits weak cross - reactivity to human tissues [ 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 358, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 583}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 808}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 855, "end": 864}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 203}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
