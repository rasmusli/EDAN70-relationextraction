Glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT , and low doses combined with other immunosuppressants are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation . In case of acute rejection , recipients receive pulse methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection . There are convincing data that bolus doses of glucocorticoids given for rejection treatment have a negative impact on HCV recurrence . It is estimated that cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality , higher levels of HCV viremia , and more severe histological recurrence [ 34 ] . One recent study demonstrated that glucocorticosteroids specifically increased HCV entry by upregulating the cell entry factors occludin and scavenger receptor class B type I . The data suggested that the potential effects of high - dose glucocorticosteroids on HCV infection in vivo may be due to increased HCV dissemination [ 35 ] . Previous studies have indicated that the specific CD4 T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of acute HCV infection after liver transplantation . Moreover , plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [ 36 , 37 ] . Experimental data have shown that prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis [ 38 ] . Thus , in a transplant setting , the consensus is that steroid avoidance or slow tapering of the dose is associated with reduced HCV recurrence [ 39 , 40 ] , whereas boluses for treating acute rejection can increase the viral load [ 31 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1001, "end": 1005}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 227}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 422}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 565}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 892}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 928}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1063, "end": 1083}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1089, "end": 1111}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1207, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1543, "end": 1547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1601, "end": 1617}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
