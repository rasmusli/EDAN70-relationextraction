{"cord_uid": "sxohecoi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836734", "divid": "16", "text": "We evaluated the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH - dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV - 1 JRFL ; 50 % inhibitory concentrations ( IC 50 s ) of the antibodies ranged from 0 . 06 to . 50 mg / ml ( Fig . 3E ) . Both poorly neutralizing antibodies ( HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240 ; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs ( 4E10 , 2F5 , 2G12 , VRC01 , and b12 ; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6 . 0 . At 50 mg / ml , transcytosis correlated directly with mAb binding to HIV - 1 JRFL ( Spearman rho = 0 . 75 ; p = 0 . 052 ) and inversely with the IC 50 of the mAbs ( Spearman rho = 20 . 71 ; p = 0 . 050 ) ( Figure S5 ) . At pH 6 . 0 , all Env - specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM - bl cells ( Figure 3C and D ) . However , there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity ( IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis ( Spearman ' s rho = 0 . 86 ; p = 0 . 001 ) . Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG , F240 and b6 , at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg / ml , was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non - FcRn - dependent manner ( i . e . , in the presence of Den3 control mAb ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Conversely , transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC 50 s , such as VRC01 and b12 , resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , strong binding activity results in more FcRn - dependent transcytosis , whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 34}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 344}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 380}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 408}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 626, "end": 631}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 726}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 736}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1116, "end": 1122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1124, "end": 1129}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1133, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1266, "end": 1271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1321, "end": 1338}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1404}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1438, "end": 1444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1448, "end": 1452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1515, "end": 1537}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1600, "end": 1605}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
