Our in vitro observations are applicable to male - to - female transmission via vaginal intercourse , where enhanced transcytosis could facilitate infection . In this regard , Li et al . reported FcRn expression and bidirectional IgG transport in a human vaginal tissue model [ 19 ] . Although we did not detect FcRn in the apical layers of vaginal epithelium , we did detect abundant FcRn expression in columnar endocervical epithelial cells . These cells may be exposed to acidic vaginal secretions where they occur at the cervical os . Furthermore , cervical ectopy , a common condition characterized by the extension of endocervical columnar epithelium into the ectocervix and upper vagina , has been implicated as a risk factor for HIV - 1 infection [ 44 , 45 ] . Prevalent in reproductive - age women , these cervical lesions are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for FcRn - mediated male - to - female HIV - 1 transmission [ 46 ] . FcRn was also found , though not consistently , in basal epithelial cells of the vagina . These cells lie deep in the epithelium and are unlikely to come in contact with acidic secretions and HIV - 1 immune complexes unless there were trauma or substantial thinning of the overlying squamous epithelium . It is important to note that seminal fluid can rapidly raise the pH of cervicovaginal secretions to levels which would not support immune complex - FcRn binding . However , the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range [ 29 ] . Furthermore , HIV is present in preejaculate secretions and could be introduced into the female genital tract prior to ejaculation [ 47 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1155, "end": 1160}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1591, "end": 1606}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1608, "end": 1613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 760}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 928, "end": 946}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1006, "end": 1023}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
