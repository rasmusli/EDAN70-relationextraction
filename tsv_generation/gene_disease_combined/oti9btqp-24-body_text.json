Deletion of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type bnAbs ( broadly neutralising antibodies ) against ZIKV - E protein . 24 The antibody responses induced by the consensus ZIKV - prME appear as robust or in some cases superior in magnitude to those elicited by similarly developed MR766 ZIKV - prME and Brazil ZIKV - prME vaccines . These constructs were sequence matched with the original ZIKV - MR766 isolate or a recently circulating ZIKV strain from Brazil , respectively . While supportive , further study will provide more insight into the effects of such incorporated designed changes on induced immune responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 276}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 303}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 476}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
