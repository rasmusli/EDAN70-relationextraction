Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories , these results indicate that IFITMs can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle , in target cells as well as in virus - producing cells . These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 75}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 246}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
