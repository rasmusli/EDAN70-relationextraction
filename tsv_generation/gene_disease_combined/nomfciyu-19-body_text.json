To overcome this obstacle and to reduce the cost , extremely powerful neutralizing mAbs which can be given in smaller doses without compromising the efficacy is needed . One strategy to achieve this could be to design humanized mAbs with exceptional binding attraction and targeting them against the potential targets , such as RBD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 383}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 79}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
