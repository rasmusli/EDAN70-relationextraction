Viral sialidases are critically required for viral propagation because they are required for release from the host cell . Drug discovery of inhibitors targeting sialidase has focused on either synthetic compounds through random screening or substrate ( N - acetylneuraminic acid ) mimics . However , these studies have mainly been targeted against sialidase from the influenza virus . There are several inhibitors that mimic the substrate , including zanamivir ( Relenza ) , oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ; a cyclohexene derivative ) , peramivir ( a cyclopentane - based inhibitor ) and A - 315675 ( a pyrrolidine - based inhibitor ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . All of these compounds are based on 2 - deoxy - 2 , 3 - dehydro - Nacetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac2en ) , a putative transitionstate analogue . At present , the existence of drug - resistant strains against zanamivir ( Gubareva et al . , 1998 ) , oseltamivir ( Gubareva et al . , 2001 ) and other antivirals ( Tambi\u0107 Andrasevi\u0107 , 2004 ) have spurred on the need to discover innovative antiviral agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 534}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
