Amino acid substitutions were introduced by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Constructs were verified by sequence analysis before transiently expressed in FreeStyle 293 cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and purified by protein A affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare , United Kingdom ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 85}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
