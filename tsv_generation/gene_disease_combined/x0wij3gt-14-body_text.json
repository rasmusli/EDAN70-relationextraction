All data from western blot analysis , real - time PCR , and luciferase assays were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD . In cell viability assay , the bar graphs represented the mean \u00b1 s . d . of relative cell viability compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments . In western blot analysis , the optical densities ( OD ) of pPDK1 , PDK1 , EP4 and C - Jun were normalized to the OD of GAPDH in the same membrane . The data represented the mean \u00b1 s . d . of relative OD compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments with three samples in each . In transient transfection assay , the bar graphs represent the mean \u00b1 s . d . of relative luciferase activities compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments . One - way anova analyses followed by the Least Significant Difference ( LSD ) test were performed . Asterisks showed in the figures indicate significant differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding control condition . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 403}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
