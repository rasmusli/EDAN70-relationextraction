By investigating how CVB3 escaped DFMO - mediated polyamine depletion , we observed novel mutations in viral proteases that led us to investigate how polyamines contribute to viral protease activity . Thus , these escape mutants have highlighted a novel function of polyamines during viral infection . As described above , these results have implications for antiviral therapy , but they also inform our understanding of basic mechanisms in virology . Additional mechanisms whereby polyamines function in virus infection may be observed using similar means to highlight how these relatively simple molecules contribute to infection in diverse ways .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 252, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
