{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "7", "text": "To address whether ADP - ribosylation plays a broad role in viral immunity , we wished to take a comprehensive evolutionary approach to look for evidence of rapid evolution in all of the human PARP genes . We reasoned that evolutionary signatures of recurrent adaptation , such as those previously observed in PARP13 , might reveal other uncharacterized PARP proteins that are involved in host - virus interactions . We therefore screened all 17 human PARP genes and their primate orthologs for signatures of recurrent positive selection . Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in ' housekeeping ' functions , we found that nearly one third of human PARP genes bore signatures of recurrent genetic conflicts . In addition to PARP13 , our evolutionary screen revealed four other PARP genes that have evolved under very strong positive selection in primates : PARP4 , 9 , 14 and 15 . Two of these genes ( PARP14 and 15 ) have also undergone dramatic gene turnover ( gain and loss ) during vertebrate evolution , an additional hallmark of gene innovation also seen in innate immunity genes such as APOBEC3 and TRIM5 [ 38 , 39 ] . Based on their rapid evolution , we hypothesize that these four additional PARP genes are involved in as - yetundescribed host - virus conflicts . Importantly , we anticipate that the identification of these rapidly evolving PARP genes and domains will enable future experiments to elucidate the role ADPribosylation plays in viral replication and host immunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 204}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 682}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 810}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 885}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1108}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1116, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1134}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1223, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1373, "end": 1384}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
