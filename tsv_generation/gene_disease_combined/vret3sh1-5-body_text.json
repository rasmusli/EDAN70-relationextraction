To truly expose the SEED data for efficient large - scale use by the global scientific community , we initially developed a Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) server to allow the needed programmatic access to the SEED data [ 21 ] ; however , the SOAP server could not scale up with the increased volume of data . To cope with the increasing demands placed on the SEED web services , as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the SEED resources , we developed a secondgeneration of web services to improve throughput , response time , and access to SEED functionality . Here , we describe in detail the four primary servers now available for remotely accessing SEED data and we describe the client - side distribution of server scripts that we provide as examples of how the servers may be applied to perform complex analyses of genome data .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 263}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 460}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 605, "end": 610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 692}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 811}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 923}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
