We compiled spatial data from the IUCN and identified 96 bat species from 10 families that are distributed in Western Asia ( Table S1 ) . Species richness is highly variable in the region ( Figure 2 ) , with no bat species reported in Bahrain and up to 43 species reported in Iran ( Table S1 ) . Bat species diversity hotspots include the Mediterranean coast from Israel extending to Turkey , the Caucasus mountain region that includes Armenia , Georgia , and Azerbaijan , and northeastern Pakistan ( Figure 2 ) . Conversely , arid regions have the lowest species richness , including the vast majority of Saudi Arabia , Oman , United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Qatar , and Iraq . While our map provides a good approximation of bat species richness in the region , using IUCN data alone may likely represent an underestimate as many species have not been reassessed since 2008 . Several new distributional records have been published in the last decade , which expands the known geographic range for some species . In other cases , estimates of species richness are lower than depicted , e . g . , at least one species ( i . e . , Myotis hajastanicus ) has been shown to be a local variant of a widespread species rather than a distinct species [ 102 ] .

Rasterized polygons of species ' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two - letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [ 107 ] and viridis [ 108 ] .
