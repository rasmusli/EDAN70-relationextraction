{"cord_uid": "tg0tczni", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3079669", "divid": "4", "text": "The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in poliovirus samples is low ( mean ENC = 53 . 754 > 40 ) . The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those polioviruses . Depending on the RSCU data , it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes . Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern ( exists in the genotype - 1 of polioviruses ) . No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived polioviruses ( DVPVs ) , wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus genes . The relative abundance of dinucleotide ( CpG ) in the ORFs of polioviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1 . Conclusion : The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution , especially for DVPVs genotype 1 , but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 762, "end": 774}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 333}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 647}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
