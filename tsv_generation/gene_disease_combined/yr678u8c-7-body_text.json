In the first , ATG12 becomes conjugated to ATG5 in a process requiring the E1 - like enzyme ATG7 and the E2 - like enzyme ATG10 . ATG12 - ATG5 then binds to ATG16L and forms a large complex known as the ATG16L complex . This complex localises to the phagophore and can determine the site of conjugation of the second Ubl system . In this second system , microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 ( LC3 ) is initially cleaved by ATG4 near the C - terminus at position G120 to generate cytoplasmic LC3 - I . This subsequently becomes lipidated with phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) in a process requiring ATG7 and another E2 - like enzyme ATG3 to generate membrane tethered LC3 - II [ 19 ] . LC3 - II is inserted into both the inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome , and as such , remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway [ 20 , 21 ] . As a result , LC3 has become an extremely valuable marker protein for studying autophagy . Figure 2 . Schematic of mammalian autophagy pathway . MTOR is the major control complex for autophagy . MTOR senses levels of amino acids , glucose and growth factors , as well as genotoxic and ER stress . Upon stimulatory signals , MTOR becomes inactivated and the ULK complex becomes hypophosphorylated and relocalises to the phagophore , along with PIP3 , produced by class III PI3K complexes . The Atg16L complex and LC3II are also recruited to the growing autophagosome , allowing expansion of the membrane and fusion to give a complete autophagosome , engulfing organelles , aggregated proteins and intracellular pathogens . The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome , resulting in the degradation of the contents and recycling of nutrients into the cytoplasm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 138}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 183}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 326}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 380}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 570}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 652, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 770, "end": 775}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 821, "end": 848}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 866}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1048, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1179, "end": 1184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1229, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1358, "end": 1363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1391, "end": 1403}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1496, "end": 1521}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1527, "end": 1542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1546, "end": 1552}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1706, "end": 1726}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
