{"cord_uid": "v07oosd2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5437690", "divid": "3", "text": "Post - weaning diarrhea ( PWD ) due to Escherichia coli is an economically important disease in pig production worldwide , affecting pigs during the first 2 weeks after weaning and characterized by sudden death or diarrhea , dehydration , and growth retardation in surviving piglets [ 1 , 2 ] . Furthermore , many stress factors associated with the weaning period , such as removal from the sow , dietary changes , adapting to a new environment , mixing of pigs from different farms and histological changes in the small intestine , may negatively affect the response of immune system and lead to an intestinal gut dysfunction in pigs [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Post - weaning diarrhea is usually associated with proliferation of enterotoxigenic E . coli ( ETEC ) [ 2 , 6 ] . This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins , both essential for disease development [ 7 ] , the predominant adhesins in PWD being F4 and F18 [ 6 , 8 ] . Small intestinal adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC in pigs is mediated by F4 or F18 specific receptors , the existence and function of these receptors being crucial to determine the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infections [ 7 ] . The predominant serogroup of ETEC associated with PWD in pigs worldwide is O149 , commonly in the combination O149 : LT : STa : STb : EAST1 : F4ac [ 2 ] . Colistin , a polymyxin antibiotic produced by Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus [ 9 ] , is widely used for the control of PWD in pigs [ 10 ] . However , in humans this antibiotic is now considered as the last therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug - resistant Gram - negative bacteria ( MDR - GNB ) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species [ 11 , 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 839, "end": 848}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 922}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 935, "end": 938}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1072}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1343, "end": 1348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 24}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 30}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 211}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 223}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 237}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 262}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 600, "end": 627}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 655, "end": 679}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 929}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1177, "end": 1193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1251, "end": 1255}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1482, "end": 1486}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
