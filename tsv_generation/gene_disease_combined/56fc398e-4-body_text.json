In other countries where FMD is endemic , livestock movements are believed to play a significant role in disease persistence [ 11 ] . Movements of live animals are also thought to cause significant transmission of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis ( bTB ) in the UK [ 12 , 13 ] , as well as vector - borne diseases such as trypanosomiasis in southeast Asia , Australasia and Africa [ 14 , 15 ] , and Rift Valley fever in Africa [ 16 ] . In cases such as these , infected livestock may be moved prior to showing symptoms , and therefore there is a risk of long - distance spread occurring . It is therefore crucial to understand the risk of infection spread associated with livestock movements .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 16}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 232}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 454}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 521}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 545}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 624}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
