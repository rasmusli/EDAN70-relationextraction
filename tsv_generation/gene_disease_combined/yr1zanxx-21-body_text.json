{"cord_uid": "yr1zanxx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6354430", "divid": "21", "text": "To determine whether alterations in APC populations impact antiviral immune responses , control - and PLX5622 - # treated mice were infected via f . p . with WNV - NY ( 100 PFU ) . After f . p . infection , WNV - infected cells traffic to draining popliteal lymph nodes ( pLN ) and stimulate an antiviral immune response [ 53 ] . At 4 dpi , a time - point of high serum viral loads ( Fig . 2l ) , flow cytometric assessment revealed a trend towards decreased CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood ( Fig . 4a - d ) and significantly reduced percentages and total numbers of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the pLN of PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 4k - n ) . There was no difference in numbers or percentages of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells in either blood or pLN ( Fig . 4e - g , o - q ) ; however , the percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood positive for co - stimulatory molecule CD80 + was significantly decreased in PLX5622versus control - treated mice ( Fig . 4h - j ) . In the pLN , the numbers and percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells positive for co - stimulatory molecule CD86 were significantly reduced in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control mice ( Fig . 4r - t ) . The impact of CSF1R antagonism on CD80 and CD86 expression appears to be tissuedependent as the blood showed no difference in APCs expressing CD86 and the pLN showed no difference in APCs expressing CD80 ( Additional file 7 ) . Together , these data indicate that CSF1R antagonism decreases the expression of co - stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APC populations . Because infectious virus was detected in the spleens of mice infected i . c . with WNV - NS5 - E218A ( Fig . 3i ) , splenic APCs were analyzed using flow cytometry at 8 dpi . Results indicated no significant difference in the numbers or percentages of MHCII + CD11c + CD + cells in the spleens of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice ( Fig . 5a - c ) . However , splenic APCs collected from PLX5622 - treated mice exhibited significantly reduced populations of cells expressing co - stimulatory molecules CD80 ( Fig . 5d - f ) and CD86 ( Fig . 5g - i ) compared with control - treated mice . Furthermore , splenic MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells showed significant reduction in the expression level of CD86 ( Fig . 5l , m ) and non - significant reduction of CD80 ( Fig . 5j , k ) in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice . This correlated with a small , but significant increase in the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , but no difference in numbers or percentages of WNV - specific NS4B tetramer staining or CD69 positivity in spleens of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice infected i . c . with WNV - NS5 - E218A ( Additional file 8 ) . Together , these data indicate that CSF1R antagonism reduces the activation of inflammatory responses in peripheral APCs even without significant depletion .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 912, "end": 917}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1110, "end": 1115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1228, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1248, "end": 1253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1257, "end": 1262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1356, "end": 1361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1413, "end": 1418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1478, "end": 1484}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1523, "end": 1553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1837, "end": 1843}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1340, "end": 1345}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1402}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1571}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
