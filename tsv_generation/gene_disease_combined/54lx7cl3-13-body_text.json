Age plays a major role in pneumonia risk . In developed countries , such as the USA , the risk of pneumonia is highest in individuals who are 65 years or over ( Fig . 1 ) [ 48 ] . The elevated risk in the elderly is likely due to impaired host defenses and an increase in comorbidities - heart failure , liver disease and underlying lung diseasewhich increase risk of aspiration pneumonia that can occur from dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( reviewed by Akg\u00fcn et al . [ 49 ] ) . In developing countries , the burden of pneumonia is greatest in young children [ 2 ] due to their inability to physically remove and immunologically deal with bacterial pathogens ( reviewed by Siegrist [ 50 ] ) . Very young children also have the greatest prevalence in the nasopharynx of common bacterial pneumonia pathogens : S . pneumoniae , H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis [ 23 , 51 ] . Increased carriage may be an important risk factor for pneumonia if the URT bacterial community structure is a determinant of pneumonia etiology . Unfortunately , the majority of carriage studies have been conducted among children < 5 years of age , which limits our ability to establish the role of nasopharyngeal carriage in other age groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 113}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 311}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 383}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 577}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 593}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 626}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 643, "end": 664}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 694}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 730}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1290, "end": 1300}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
