How these RNA structures act is incompletely understood , but accumulating evidence supports the view that by presenting an unusual topology ( 1 , 2 , ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) they confound an intrinsic unwinding activity of the ribosome with consequent effects on the elongation cycle and frame maintenance ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 ) . Indeed , kinetic analyses in bacterial systems indicate that stimulatory RNAs can impair movements of the ribosomal small subunit ( 30S ) head , delaying dissociation of EF - G and the release of tRNA from the ribosome ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 270}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 638, "end": 655}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 720}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 747, "end": 754}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 773, "end": 778}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
