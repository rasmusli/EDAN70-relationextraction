The most common causes of bacterial pneumonia for children < 5 years of age are Streptococcus pneumoniae , followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus [ 11 ] although this varies over time and space . From a rudimentary ecological perspective , the human respiratory tract can be defined as an ecosystem with two distinct niches : the URT , characterized by regular asymptomatic carriage of commensal bacteria , and the LRT , which is inhabited at a low abundance by bacteria in healthy individuals [ 13 ] . During the first year after birth , the nasopharynx is rapidly colonized [ 14 ] and URT carriage is established via ongoing synergistic and antagonistic interactions among commensal bacteria [ 15 ] . Although pneumonia is an infection of the lungs , microbial selection in the URT may play an important role in etiology as bacterial strains in the URT can be readily aspirated into the LRT . For example , URT carriage is believed to be a necessary precursor of pneumonia due to S . pneumoniae [ 16 , 17 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 20}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 155}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 843, "end": 853}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 882}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1106}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
