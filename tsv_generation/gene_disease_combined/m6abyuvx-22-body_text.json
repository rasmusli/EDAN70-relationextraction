The percentage of macrophages ( CD11b + F4 / 80 + ) among IHLs and IL - 6 production from these macrophages were significantly lower in rVV - N25 - treated mice than in control mice ( Figure 6G ) . Though the percentage of TNF - a - producing macrophages was not significantly different in rVV - N25 - treated and control mice ( P = 0 . 099 ) , rVV - N25 treatment appeared to suppress these macrophages . These results demonstrated that rVV - N25 had a suppressive effect on activated macrophages , and they indicated that this suppression ameliorated the histological indicators of chronic hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 97}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 874}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
