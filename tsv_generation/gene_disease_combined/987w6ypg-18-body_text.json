The results obtained with this analysis indicated that IFITMs are indeed present at sites of Gag budding , further supporting the notion that IFITMs are truly incorporated into HIV - 1 virion particles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
