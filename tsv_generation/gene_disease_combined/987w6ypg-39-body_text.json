Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages ( MDM ) or DCs with M - CSF or GM - CSF / IL4 for 4 to 6 days ( AbCys ) , while PBLs were activated with IL2 ( 150 U / mL , AIDS Reagents and Reference Program of the NIH ) and PHA ( 1 \u03bcg / mL , Sigma ) . For replicative infections , cells were challenged with an MOI of 0 , 1 of ADA . Every 3 - 4 days aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested and replaced with fresh media . The extent of viral replication in the cell culture was measured by exo - RT activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 320}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
