The recombinant MVA expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full - length MERS - CoV N ( MVA - MERS - N ) proved genetically stable and fully replication - competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts , an established cell substrate for MVA vaccine manufacturing . Upon in vitro infection , MVA - MERS - N produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with MERS - CoV N - specific antibodies . Furthermore , MVA - MERS - N was tested as an experimental vaccine in BALB / c mice and elicited MERS - CoV N - specific interferon \u03b3 ( IFN - \u03b3 ) - producing CD8 + T cells . Using peptide library covering the whole MERS - CoV N polypeptide , we identified new H2 - d restricted peptide epitopes of MERS - CoV N in BALB / c mice . This data will be highly relevant for further assessment of N antigen - specific immune responses in the well - established MERS - CoV - BALB / c mouse immunization / challenge model [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 222}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 436}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 777}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 860}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
