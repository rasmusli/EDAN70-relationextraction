Putative proline rich region at VP1 - 228 - 240 ( P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was also observed in Thai CaKoVs as well as reference viruses ( Table 4 ) . In this study , unique amino acids were found in Thai and Chinese CaKoVs at the position , 65 V , 67D , 119L , 138T , 150P , 151M , 153D , 201S , 204Q , 205Q , 201Q , 213T and 241E ( Table 4 ) .
