Interestingly , a pathway that involved the degradation of CFTR was significantly enriched in our study . CFTR is a transmembrane protein that functions as an ATP - gated chloride channel 53 . Deficiency in CFTR can lead to several diseases related to the reduction of chloride secretion and the increase of sodium uptake 54 . Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in CFTR - deficient epithelial cells and that CFTR may be effective in cell repair after injury 18 , 55 , 56 . CPV is normally cytopathic in infected F81 cells . Typical CPEs appear as a mesh of monolayer cells prompted by detached cells . These results provided us hints that CPV may trigger CFTR deficiency and influence the cell pathological change by reducing the wound healing of infected cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 663, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 96}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 310}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 513}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 608}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 802}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
