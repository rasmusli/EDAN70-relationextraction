Two pairs of inversion loci , ( 4593 , 4596 ) Data from Illumina sequencing were used to test the hypothesis that sub - consensus variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies in the historical samples than those sub - consensus variants that did not . Loci shown in Figure 5 where inversion of the dominant and minor variants occurred between the historical and later samples are referred to as ' ' inversion sites ' ' . The frequencies of sub - consensus variants at the inversion sites were compared to that of variants at non - inversion sites present in the 1995 samples ( but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003 / 10 samples ) to determine if those variants at inversion sites were present in higher numbers in the pre - outbreak samples . The average frequency of sub - consensus variants at inversion sites was slightly but significantly higher than that of sub - consensus variants at non - inversion sites ( p = 0 . 03 , twosample t - test one - tailed ) . Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak ( prior to July1 , 2009 ) had increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected at the inversion sites as a sub - consensus mutation , although the difference fell short of statistical significance ( p = 0 . 08 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 377}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 466}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 628}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 669}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 947}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 966}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1045, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1242, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1283, "end": 1299}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1304, "end": 1329}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
