{"cord_uid": "htoexg53", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6316859", "divid": "20", "text": "Recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N was formed in CEF that were infected with MVA and transfected with the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red - MERS - N ( Figure 1a ) . The MVA DNA sequences in pIIIH5red - MERS - N ( flank - 1 , flank - 2 ) targeted the insertion of the N gene sequences into the site of deletion III within the MVA genome . The clonal isolation was facilitated by co - production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mCherry allowing for the convenient detection of MVA - MERS - N infected cells during plaque purification . The repetitive DNA sequence of flank - 1 ( FR ) served to remove the marker gene mCherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination ( marker gene deletion ) . After PCR analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95 % MVA - MERS - N recombinant viruses in the cultures , we selected the final marker - free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mCherry fluorescence . To confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous N gene sequences within the MVA - MERS - N genome , we analyzed viral genomic DNA by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for MVA sequences adjacent to the deletion III insertion site ( Figure 1b In addition , the comparative Western blot analysis of cell lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF with antigen - specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both MERS - CoV candidate antigens ( Figure 2b ) . This observation is in line with the fact that the MVA - MERS - S candidate vector vaccine expresses the MERS - CoV S gene sequences using the identical PmH5 promoter system [ 23 ] . As shown in previous studies , we detected two MERS - CoV S - specific protein bands upon infection with MVA - MERS - S indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full - length S glycoprotein ( ~ 210 kDa ) into an N - terminal ( ~ 120 kDa S1 domain ) and a C - terminal ( ~ 85 kDa S2 domain ; not detected ) subunit [ 23 , 50 , 51 ] . Following this , we used the total protein lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF to assess the recognition of the MERS - CoV N and S antigens by sera from experimentally MERS - CoV infected animals . The Western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit ( Figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey ( Figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the MERS - CoV N protein . The recognition of the MERS - CoV N protein was at least as prominent as the MERS - CoV S antigen , which was suggestive of the induction of substantial N - specific antibody responses after experimental MERS - CoV infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 565}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 583}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 994}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1129}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1143, "end": 1161}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1220, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1250, "end": 1278}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1414, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1516, "end": 1546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1667, "end": 1695}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1715, "end": 1729}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1792, "end": 1830}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1932, "end": 1947}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1951, "end": 1959}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1969, "end": 1982}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1986, "end": 2004}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 2012, "end": 2025}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
