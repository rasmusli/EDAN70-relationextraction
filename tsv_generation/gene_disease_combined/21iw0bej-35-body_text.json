After cell cycle release from G0 / G1 , mock - infected cells entered S phase , while EV - D68 - infected cells still accumulated at G0 / G1 phase , thus demonstrating that EV - D68 infection prevents S phase entry from G0 / G1 phase . Furthermore , after G2 / M synchronization , EV - D68 infection promoted cell cycle transition from G2 / M into G0 / G1 phase . Therefore , EV - D68 infection regulates G0 / G1 cell cycle arrest both by promoting G0 / G1 phase entry and by inhibiting G0 / G1 phase departure . To further analyze the mechanism of host cell cycle manipulation by EV - D68 , we assessed the expression of cyclins and CDKs that are known to form complexes to regulate cell cycle progression ( Oosthuysen et al . , 2015 ) . For example : cyclinD / CDK4 and cyclinD / CDK6 regulate G0 / G1 progression ( Massagu\u00e9 , 2004 ) ; cyclinE / CDK2 regulates S - phase entry from G1 ( Hinds et al . , 1992 ) ; cyclinA / CDK2 regulates Sphase progression by replacing cyclinE ( Coverley et al . , 2002 ; Yam et al . , 2002 ) ; and cyclinB1 / CDK1 prevents cell cycle transition from G2 / M into G0 / G1 ( Yu et al . , 2013 ; Adeyemi and Pintel , 2014 ) . We demonstrated that cyclinD , CDK4 , CDK6 , cyclinE1 and CDK2 are down - regulated after EV - D68 infection , which could explain the ability of EV - D68 to inhibit the transition from G0 / G1 to S phase . Furthermore , the expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 was down - regulated after EV - D68 infection , which is consistent with the ability of EV - D68 to promoting the transition from G2 / M to G / G1 . Therefore , expression of cell cycle - related proteins further supports our results suggesting that EV - D68 induces G0 / G1 arrest by regulating G0 / G1 phase entry and exit . We also analyzed whether the regulation of protein expression occurred at the mRNA level and found that CDK2 and CDK1 were down - regulated by EV - D68 , but that the other cell cycle proteins were not . This indicates that the regulation of cellular factors related to the cell cycle by EV - D68 occurs partly at the transcriptional level , but mostly occurs at the post - translational level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 782}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 920}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 939}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 1005}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1081}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1123, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1202}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1331, "end": 1339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1341, "end": 1346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1348, "end": 1353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1355, "end": 1364}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1373}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1558}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1562, "end": 1567}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
