Although both the transitions among locations ( Markov jumps ) and the waiting times between transitions ( Markov rewards ) are not directly observed , posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [ 29 , 30 ] . Here , we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source - sink dynamics of influenza and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 561}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
