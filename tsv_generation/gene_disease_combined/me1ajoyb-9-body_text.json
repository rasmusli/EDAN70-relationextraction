Experimental intramuscular infection of deer mice with SNV resulted in detectable virus in the lungs as few as two days later [ 13 ] . Many organs appeared infected , although infection was limited to the vasculature within those tissues . Two infectious outcomes occur in experimentally infected deer mice ; a disseminated infection of three or more organs , or a restricted infection of the lungs and heart [ 40 ] . The relevance of these two patterns to transmission efficiency is unknown . The levels of viral RNA vary dramatically in infected deer mice , with most having modest to moderate levels of RNA at the peak of infection . However , some deer mice have significantly greater amounts of viral RNA , suggesting these deer mice may produce substantially more virus than others , and it is possible they transmit virus more efficiently ( e . g . , \" supershedders \" ) [ 13 ] . This also occurs in semi - natural transmission experiments [ 9 ] and suggests certain individuals may have a prominent role in population - level transmission of hantaviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 652}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 844}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1184, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
