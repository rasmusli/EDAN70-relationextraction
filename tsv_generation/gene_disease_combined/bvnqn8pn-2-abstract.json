Aim . To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations . Methods . We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for acute asthma in 2016 in our Pediatric ED . Results . Visits for acute asthma were 603 / 23197 ( 2 . 6 % ) . 76 % of the patients were < 6 years old and 24 % \u2265 6 . Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups ; 33 % of the school - aged children had a triggering allergic condition ( versus 3 % in < 6 years ; < . 01 ) . 191 patients had a previous history of asthma ; among them , 95 were \u2265 6 years , 67 % of whom were not using any controller medication , showing a higher risk of a moderate - to - severe exacerbation than those under long - term therapy ( < . 01 ) . Exacerbations peaked in autumn and winter in preschoolers and in spring and early autumn in the school - aged children .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 20}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 350}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 401, "end": 414}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 628}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 723}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
