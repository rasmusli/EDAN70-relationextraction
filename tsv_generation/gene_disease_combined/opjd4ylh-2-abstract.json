TB is a major cause of illness and death worldwide , especially in Asia and Africa . Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness , the tragedy is that TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen . The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province , South Africa . Qualitative , exploratory , and descriptive designs were used . A non - probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants . The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years ' experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored , and it was guided by data saturation . Data were collected through in - depth individual interviews . Data were analyzed using Colaizzi ' s method . Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study . The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data : challenges of the working environment , problems impacting on the quality of nursing care , fear , anxiety , stress and risk of contracting infection , nurses ' perceptions towards patients , support structure available in the hospital , and support needs for the nurses .
