As with the grey squirrels , swab samples effectively recovered both target and reference DNA in red squirrels , with only one arm swab failing to isolate squirrel DNA ( n = 6 for each cutaneous swab site and n = 7 for rectal swabs ) ( see absolute quantification results in the Online Resource S10 , Fig .
