Several human coronaviruses have been identified , causing mainly mild respiratory infections , with the exception of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) . In addition , coronavirus infections have an economic impact on livestock industries worldwide . The avian coronavirus , infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) , causes infectious OPEN ACCESS bronchitis ( IB ) , a mild respiratory infection , but as a consequence is responsible for serious effects on the global poultry industries due to poor weight gain in broiler chickens as well as reduced egg production and egg quality in layers . In addition , some strains of IBV are nephropathogenic whilst others result in severe pathology in the reproductive organs . Bovine coronavirus ( BCoV ) causes respiratory infection and diarrhoea in cattle , transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( PEDV ) cause diarrhoea in pigs and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( PHEV ) causes vomiting and wasting disease in pigs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 237}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 307}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 320}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 361}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 473}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 524}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 526, "end": 529}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 562}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 941}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 955}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1051, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1074}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1161}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1181}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
