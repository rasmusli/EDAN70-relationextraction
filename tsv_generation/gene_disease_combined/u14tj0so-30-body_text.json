Following the recent work of Aghaeepour and Hoos [ 61 ] and Hajiaghayi et al . [ 58 ] we calculate the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure as follows . For each vector f of F - measures ( where , for example , f may be the F - measures of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted structures ) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement , where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f ( | f | ) , and then calculate their average F - measures . These 10 4 calculated average F - measures represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f . We then report the 2 . 5th and 97 . 5th percentile of this distribution ( i . e . , the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average F - measures calculated above ) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively , and call it the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval . By reporting the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average F - measure of a method , A , on a data set , D , we say that we are 95 % confident that the average F - measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval . All calculations are performed using the \" boot \" package of the R statistics software environment [ 62 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 779}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1209, "end": 1221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1310, "end": 1322}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
