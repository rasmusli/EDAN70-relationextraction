Various functionalities are accessible under specific menus . The ' Classification ' menu gives access to the complete list of putative LIR motifs in viral proteins . Two virus taxonomic systems have been used : the nomenclature used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) to name the species , genus and families of each of the viruses cited in the database , and the Baltimore classification system that groups viruses depending on their genome and kind of replication ( dsDNA , dsRNA , ssDNA , ssRNA and reverse - transcribing viruses ) ( see Methods ) . 63 , 64 For each specific family or group of viruses , the data are presented in a table containing ( i ) the clickable UniProtKB accession number of the protein , ( ii ) the information related to the LIR - motif ( position , sequence , PSSM score , if the pattern is recognized as an xLIR or WxxL motif and the presence of the motif in an intrinsically disordered region ( ANCHOR ) ) , ( iii ) the name of the protein and ( iv ) the name of the species . For some genera , no putative LIR - containing protein ( LIRCP ) could be identified ; for accuracy in the classification , these are listed but appear in red ( Fig . 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 270}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 919}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 996}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 999, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1087}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1225}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
