Howie et al . recently investigated pneumonia etiology in children in Gambia , observing that S . pneumoniae was the leading cause with a high rate of microbial agent co - detection [ 15 ] . Conversely , they found that viral pneumonia was not predominant whereas we observed that 3 viruses , namely human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus , were associated with pneumonia in Mali . Major differences between the 2 studies were sample type ( lung aspirates vs . nasal swabs in our investigation ) and the lack of a comparative group in the study by Howie et al . which did not permit comparison of microbial prevalence in pneumonia patients and healthy subjects [ 15 ] . In a Western Kenya case - control study , S . pneumoniae , RSV , and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of pneumonia in children [ 16 ] . We noted almost similar results in Mali . Thus , S . pneumoniae and RSV could still be considered as the primary causes of pneumonia in several sub - Sharan African countries . All patients who died had severe pneumonia , according to WHO criteria , with significant dyspnea , very marked chest indrawing and severe hypoxia . Two patients had confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia . Two patients had acute malnutrition linked with pneumonia . In 2 cases , death occurred within 24 hours of admission . Despite active treatment with antibiotics and oxygen , the management of severe respiratory distress is often difficult in this context because the hospital does not have assisted ventilatory support . Mortality was higher than in a recent birth cohort in South Africa [ 17 ] , but was similar to what was reported previously in other developing countries [ 18 , 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 314}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 712, "end": 722}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 889}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1043}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1130}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1177, "end": 1185}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1199, "end": 1215}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1226, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1286}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1305, "end": 1324}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1336, "end": 1346}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1508}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
