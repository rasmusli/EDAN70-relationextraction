We show that in time series analysis of respiratory - related data it is important to capture important seasonal effects that are present in such data , as well as to consider the influence of important covariates that can be easily obtained and incorporated into the models . We also demonstrate the importance in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of these methods , of utilizing more realistic stochastic , rather than deterministic , models for outbreaks patterns . We demonstrate spatial homogeneity in chest radiograph data across EDs and suggest ways in which these observations may be used to improve regional biosurveillance for ( re ) emergent infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 195}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 834}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
