While all the red squirrel cases suspected of having SQPV based on gross post - mortem findings were positive for SQPV when assayed using qPCR , an additional case of SQPV was discovered that had gastrointestinal pathology recorded as the cause of death . Similarly , gastrointestinal lesions have been reported in a single SQPVinfected red squirrel in Northern Ireland ( Collins et al . 2014 ) . Other SQPV - infected red squirrels in this study yielded SQPV in the gastrointestinal tract , with an increase in RQ passing through the gastrointestinal tract potentially indicating replication within the intestine . The oropharynx is also reported to be a site of replication in red squirrels ( Fiegna et al . 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 341}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 455}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 576}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 620}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
