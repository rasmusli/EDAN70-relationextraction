Serum ALT levels were not significant - ( + / 2 ) and the Cremediated activation of the transgene unit . R6CN2 HCV cDNA was cloned downstream of the CAG promoter , neomycin - resistant gene ( neo ) , and poly A ( pA ) signal flanked by two loxP sequences . This cDNA contains the core , E1 , E2 , and NS2 regions . ( B ) Cre - mediated genomic DNA recombination . After poly ( I : C ) injection , genomic DNA was extracted from liver tissues and analyzed by quantitative RTD - PCR for Cre - mediated transgenic recombination . The transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after the injection . In all cases , n = 3 mice per group . ( C ) HCV core protein expression was sustained for at least 600 days after poly ( I : C ) injection . ( D ) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that most hepatocytes expressed the HCV core protein within 6 days after injection . ( E ) Liver sections from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice after the poly ( I : C ) injection . Infiltrating lymphocytes ( arrows ) were observed on days 6 and 180 ; Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) was observed on day 360 . In contrast , these pathological changes were not observed in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice after the injection . The inset image shows abnormal mitosis in a tumor cell . ( F ) Hepatocyte swelling and abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords ( silver staining ) , as well as abnormal glycogen accumulation ( PAS staining ) were observed on day 90 in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice . We observed steatosis ( oil - red - O staining ) on day 180 and , subsequently , fibrosis ( Azan staining ) on day 480 .
