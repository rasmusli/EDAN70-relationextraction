{"cord_uid": "yr1zanxx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6354430", "divid": "19", "text": "To determine whether microglia depletion impacts innate immune mechanisms of virologic control specifically within the CNS , mice were fed control or PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , then i . c . infected with an attenuated strain of WNV ( WNV - NS5 - E218A ) at 10 4 PFU . The NS5 - E218A point mutation abolishes 2 \u2032 - O - methyltransferase activity , which functions to methylate the 5 \u2032 cap of viral RNA and facilitate escape of IFN - induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats ( IFIT ) - mediated suppression ; thus , this attenuation limits viral replication by increasing sensitivity of the virus to type I IFN - mediated innate immune mechanisms [ 45 , 49 ] . Despite this attenuation , mice treated with PLX5622 were significantly more susceptible to lethal WNV - NS5 - E218A infection than those receiving control chow ( Fig . 3a ) . Weight loss was also significantly increased in PLX5622 - treated mice ( Fig . 3b ) . Consistent with this , viral titers measured by plaque assay at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi in the olfactory bulb ( Fig . 3d ) , cortex ( Fig . 3e ) , cerebellum ( Fig . 3f ) , brainstem ( Fig . 3g ) , and spinal cord ( Fig . 3h ) were significantly higher in PLX5622 - treated compared in control - treated mice infected with WNV - NS5 - E218A . As virus was inoculated into the cortex , it was detected there at 2 dpi , followed by spread to the olfactory bulb by 4 dpi , and cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord by 6 dpi . PLX5622 treatment also led to decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the cortex at 8 dpi ( Fig . 3c ) and increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 6 dpi ( Fig . 3l - p ) after i . c . infection with WNV - NS5 - E218A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 628}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1504, "end": 1529}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 777, "end": 795}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 854, "end": 866}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
