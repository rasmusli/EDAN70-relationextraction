A key strength of this study is that we were able to gather the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the human , animal , and environmental sector . However , we had difficulty in recruiting participants from the environmental sector , and we were only able to interview two participants . A limitation of this study is that participants could have downplayed some of the challenges and some strategies that are considered key to address AMR could have been missed . For example , the fact that Singapore has a well - functioning system for dispensing antibiotics in the human sector , with antibiotics only available with a physician ' s prescription , was not mentioned as often as a facilitator as one might expect . This could be the case because it was already taken for granted as it has been in existence for several years .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 138}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 616}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
