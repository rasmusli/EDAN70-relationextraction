The participation of hnRNPs in each case may reflect the versatility of these proteins in linking sequence - specific nucleic acid binding with specific protein - protein interactions and serving as a fulcrum for multilateral molecular cross - talk ( 58 ) . It seems highly unlikely that protein - mediated recoding will be restricted to the two present examples , given the plethora of hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins present in host and viral proteomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 55, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 665}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
