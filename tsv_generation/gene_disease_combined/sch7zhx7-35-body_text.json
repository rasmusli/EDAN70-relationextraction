To this end , we treated Veros with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h . Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ) . In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3 - 2A 29K , - 3C 52R , or double protease mutant . However , with DFMO treatment , eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A ) . When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3 . In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 326, "end": 332}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 970}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
