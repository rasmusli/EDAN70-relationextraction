These do not form the specific banding patterns representing the different multimeric LAMP products that are characteristic for each assay and thus can be easily distinguished on a gel . Alternative banding patterns have been observed , also for low template reactions ; analyses of these products show that they are formed by interactions of the primers used [ 8 ] , to form LAMP equivalents of primer - dimers . Two factors seem to be important : in the absence of target , low background DNA may aid the formation of non - specific products that go on to be amplified ; and freeze - thaw repetitions may induce damage to the primers to permit the formation of ' primer intermediates ' which can then be amplified . Since LAMP is capable of non - specific amplification , techniques that rely on the detection of by - products of DNA synthesis , e . g . , the use of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation [ 9 ] or the use of SyBr Green dye [ 10 ] may not be able to distinguish between real and Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3 Figure 1 Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3 . Sequences of the plant ( above ) and transgene ( below ) at the right border junctions for MS8 and RF3 . Highlighted sequences are the targets of the LAMP primers . The plant sequences are those shown in Table 1 : dark blue bases highlighted are the outer displacement primers , yellow and green sequences are the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the LAMP primers respectively , and light blue sequences depict the loop primers . The sensitivity of the LAMP assay and its suitability for practical GMO detection was tested using assays for commonly - used sequence motifs , the CaMV 35S promoter ( P - 35S ) and the Agrobacterium promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene ( P - nos and T - nos , respectively ) . These sequences are commonly used in constructs used to create approved GM events ( see [ 11 ] ) . RoundUp Ready [UNK] soya construct contains both P - 35S and T - nos so provided convenient template for testing the assays . We used a sample where the copy number of the GM has been well characterized and thus control the number of template in each reaction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 106}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1282}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1285, "end": 1289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1293, "end": 1297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1390, "end": 1394}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1398, "end": 1426}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1449, "end": 1462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1578, "end": 1605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1613, "end": 1630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1637, "end": 1650}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1669, "end": 1690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1701, "end": 1714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1842, "end": 1858}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1864, "end": 1882}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1884, "end": 1892}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1902, "end": 1940}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1948, "end": 1971}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1973, "end": 1981}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1985, "end": 1993}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2111, "end": 2146}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2160, "end": 2168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 2172, "end": 2180}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
