In contrast , the same oils had a higher antioxidant capacity relative to the antioxidant of reference ascobic acid when measured through the FRAP assay [ 78 ] . In the same assay , the authors also reported diverse activities depending on the harvesting place . The best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat , mainly constituted by \u03b1 - pinene + \u03b1 - thujene , camphene and spathulenol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
