This analysis indicated a certain level of cross - recognition between antibodies ( particularly with the anti - IFITM2 and \u2212 3 antibodies ) . For this reason , we decided to detect the endogenous expression of IFITMs using a pool of the 3 antibodies . We first determined the pattern of expression of IFITMs in different established cell lines and primary cells ( Figure 4A ) . Given that IFITMs are interferon - stimulated genes , these cells were also stimulated for 24 hours with 1000 U / mL of IFN\u03b1 . The basal expression of IFITMs varied among cell types and was undetectable in HEK293T cells , unless IFN\u03b1 was provided . HeLa cells expressed instead robust levels of IFITMs even in the absence of IFN\u03b1 , although this stimulus further increased their expression . Similarly , the primary human cells examined here expressed undetectable / low amounts of IFITMs under standard conditions , but expression of IFITMs was robustly induced by IFN\u03b1 stimulation . This trend was reproducibly observed in four distinct donors , although the basal levels of expression of IFITMs displayed clear donor - to donor variations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 172}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 299}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 417}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 474}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 637, "end": 644}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 766}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 872}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 943, "end": 948}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1405, "end": 1412}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
