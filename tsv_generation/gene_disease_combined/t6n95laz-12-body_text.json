Some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group , giving no quantification information . The specific information and re - identification will be published in a future study . The 16 proteins that were identified using iTRAQ were classified into six categories , based on protein function ( Fig . 1 ) . The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with liver diseases were verified using western blotting : CRP precursor , hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ( Fig . 2 and Table IV ) . Two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes ( apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 691}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 693, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 761}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 933}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 638}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
