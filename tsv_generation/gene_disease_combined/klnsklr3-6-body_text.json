{"cord_uid": "klnsklr3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2699471", "divid": "6", "text": "Lactate dehydrogenase - elevating virus ( LDV ) is a small , positive sense , single stranded RNA virus of the Arteriviridae family , related to coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) virus [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . It is a natural infectious agent of mice that causes very rapid lytic infections generally restricted to a minor subset of non - essential macrophages involved in scavenging extracellular lactate dehydrogenase [ 5 , 6 ] . The rapid loss of this subset results in the elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels for which the virus is named [ 7 ] . Virus titers peak within the first day of infection as susceptible target cells are depleted , and then the infection is maintained at a much lower chronic level dependent on the replenishment of new macrophage targets [ 8 ] . LDV establishes chronic infections regardless of mouse strain , age , sex or immune - status [ 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . No clinical signs are typically associated with LDV infections , although co - infection with retroviruses can lead to CNS disease under certain circumstances [ 11 , 12 ] , and mice infected with LDV have suppressed immune responses [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] . We recently found that acute infection with LDV induced a state of partial and transient activation in the vast majority of splenic lymphocytes . Activation was characterized by high surface expression of the very early activation marker CD69 [ 16 ] . CD69 is the first surface marker known to be upregulated during the activation of lymphocytes and has recently been shown to interact with S1P1 to inhibit the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues [ 17 ] . CD69 expression is upregulated by T cell receptor ( TCR ) ligation [ 18 ] but is not dependent upon it and can be induced by inflammatory cytokines such as IFNa [ 19 , 20 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1400, "end": 1411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1418, "end": 1423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1432, "end": 1437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1571, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1644, "end": 1649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1696, "end": 1700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1792}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1800, "end": 1805}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 159}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 220}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 975}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1119, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
