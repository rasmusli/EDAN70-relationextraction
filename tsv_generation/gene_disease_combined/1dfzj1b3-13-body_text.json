This method measures the malonaldehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition , which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) . However , TBARS is representative of a rather late stage of lipid oxidation , when the oxidation substrate has undergone substantial transformation [ 29 ] . There are other methods , including the determination of peroxide value , iodine value , chromatographic measurement of volatile compounds , formic acid measurement [ the Rancimat method in an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids ( formic acid ) produced during the auto - oxidation of lipids at 100 \u00baC or above ] [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
