The labeled peptide mixtures were dissolved in 100 \u03bc L of mobile phase A [ 2 % acetonitrile in ddH 2 O , pH 10 ] and centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 20 min prior to loading onto the column . Samples were eluted by injection of stepwise gradients of mobile phase B [ 2 % ddH 2 O in acetonitrile , pH 10 ] , with a flow rate set at 700 \u03bc L / min . Each fraction was eluted for 1 . 5 min . Analysis by Q - Exactive mass spectrometry . The fractionated peptide mixtures were analysed by a Q - Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY - nLC 1000 System ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The spray voltage , capillary temperature , and declustering potential of the source ionisation parameters were set as 2 . 1 kV , 250 \u00b0 C , and 100 V , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
