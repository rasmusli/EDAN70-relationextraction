Groups of four female C57BL / 6 mice were immunised with either the control plasmid backbone ( pVax1 ) or the ZIKV - prME plasmid vaccine three times at 2 week intervals through intramuscular ( i . m . ) injection followed by electroporation at the site of delivery ( Figure 2a ) . One week after the third injection bulk splenocytes harvested from each animal and evaluated in ELISpot assays for their ability to secrete interferon - \u03b3 ( IFN - \u03b3 ) after ex vivo exposure to peptide pools encompassing ZIKV - prME . The assay results show that splenocytes from ZIKV - prME immunised mice produced a cellular immune response after stimulation with multiple ZIKV - E peptide pools ( Figure 2b ) . The region ( s ) of ZIKV - Env , which elicited the strongest cellular response ( s ) were evaluated by ELISpot assay in a matrix format using 22 peptide pools consisting of 15 - mers ( overlapping by 9 amino acids ) spanning the entire ZIKV - prME protein . Several pools demonstrated elevated T cell responses , with peptide pool 15 exhibiting the highest number of spot - forming units ( SFU ) ( Figure 2c ) . This matrix mapping analysis revealed a dominant prME epitope , ' IRCIGVSNR DFVEGM ' ( aa167 - 181 ) . This peptide was confirmed to contain a H2 - Db restricted epitope through analysis utilising the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource tool ( http : / / tools . iedb . org ) , which [UNK] supports that in this haplotype the antigen is effectively processed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 116}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 252, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 615, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 891, "end": 902}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1333, "end": 1346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1427, "end": 1454}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
