These findings may apply to other pathogens and yield a more complex view of the manner in which this emerging family of restriction factors can interfere with viral pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 158}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 398}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
