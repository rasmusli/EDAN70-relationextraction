{"cord_uid": "987w6ypg", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4251951", "divid": "17", "text": "To determine how IFITMs could be embarked into HIV - 1 viral particles , we analyzed the degree of intracellular co - localization existing between IFITMs and Gag , the main structural element of retroviral particles . To this end , cells were transfected as above in the presence of a small amount of Gag - GFP , prior to confocal microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A and B ) . As previously reported , all IFITMs were found at the plasma membrane , although more specific patterns could be observed for individual IFITMs ( more prominent intracellular localization of IFITM2 and higher cell membrane distribution of IFITM1 ) . HIV - 1 Gag displayed an heterogeneous and mostly punctuate intracellular localization pattern , as extensively reported by others [ 32 ] and not surprisingly the two signals overlapped at least partially ( Figure 3B , depicts a two - dimensional graph presenting pixel intensities for the cells presented above ) . The degree of reciprocal colocalization between Gag and IFITMs was more carefully quantified by measuring the Manders overlap coefficient ( Figure 3C ) . From 50 to 65 % of IFITMs was found to co - localize with Gag and about 70 % of Gag co - localized with IFITMs , which is overall not surprising in light of the natural intracellular distribution of these proteins . No major relocalization of either IFITMs or Gag was noted upon co - expression , indicating that these proteins are unlikely to influence the trafficking of each other . So , overall this analysis indicates that in light of their natural membrane distribution , IFITMs can find themselves at sites in which HIV - 1 virion particles assembly takes place , providing a reason for their incorporation in HIV - 1 virions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 24}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 163}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 312}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 511, "end": 518}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 636}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1156}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1174, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1205}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1354, "end": 1358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1572, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
