{"cord_uid": "9xelf8oh", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC7088385", "divid": "6", "text": "The Eurasian red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) in the UK , has suffered a severe reduction in its abundance and distribution ( Bosch and Lurz 2012 ) , coinciding with the introduction of the non - native Eastern grey squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) in the 1900s ( Gurnell and Pepper 1993 ; Usher et al . 1992 ) . A combination of modelling ( Rushton et al . 2006 ; Tompkins et al . 2003 ) , experimental infection studies ( Tompkins et al . 2002 ) and field data ( Chantrey et al . 2014 ) indicates that a major part of the decline of UK red squirrel populations is due to infection by squirrelpox virus ( SQPV ) . This pathogen is thought to have been introduced with the grey squirrel , a theory supported by a high prevalence of exposure despite an absence of clinical disease ( Bruemmer et al . 2010 ; Sainsbury et al . 2000 ) , an association between seropositive grey squirrels and the appearance of clinical cases of squirrelpox in red squirrels ( McInnes et al . , 2013 Sainsbury et al . 2008 ) and an association of the pathogen in both squirrel species during an outbreak of disease in red squirrels ( Chantrey et al . 2014 ) . Programmes to reintroduce red squirrels in the UK have been hampered by disease : by SQPV in Norfolk ( Carroll et al . 2009 ) and adenovirus in squirrels ( SADV ) in other areas of the UK ( Everest et al . 2008 ( Everest et al . , 2012b Martinez - Jimenez et al . 2011 ) . SADV appears to cause mortality in wild red squirrels ( Duff et al . 2007 ; Everest et al . 2012a ) , although the impact on a population scale is largely unknown with subclinical infections also reported ( Everest et al . 2014 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 588, "end": 606}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 926, "end": 938}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
