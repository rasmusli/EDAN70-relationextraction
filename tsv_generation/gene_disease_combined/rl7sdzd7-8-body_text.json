The former encodes the Barnase gene that give rise to male sterility , which is replaced in the latter by the Barstar gene which restores fertility : both also have the selectable marker bar which confers tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium . Though the left border of the RF3 insert has undergone rearrangement in the form of duplication and inversion [ 5 ] , the right borders of both events are relatively intact ( our data [ 6 ] which agree with the two sequences in the database ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 19}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 104}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 185}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
