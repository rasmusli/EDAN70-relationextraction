The sow placenta is not permeable to maternal immunoglobulin transport and therefore newborn piglets acquire maternal immunoglobulin from colostrum during the first 24 - 48 h of life [ 5 ] . It was reported that weaning age and pre - weaning health play a key role in the onset of PWD [ 30 ] . Moreover , the post - weaning period is a critical phase in the pig ' s life when the intestinal immune system is immature , and the sow milk removal , and consequent discontinuation of nutritive intake of the IgA present in this milk , contributes to increase susceptibility of pigs to microbial infections [ 31 ] . Indeed , unlike other food animals , the sow ' s milk is particularly rich in IgA compared to colostrum [ 32 ] . Studies investigating the profitability of weaning pigs at an early age , before 21 days , have further encouraged moving away from this practice to weaning pigs no earlier than 26 days of age to reduce the occurrence of PWD [ 30 , 33 ] . In the European Union ( EU ) , many pig producers wean piglets at 21 days of age . However welfare legislation encourages weaning no earlier than 28 days of age in the absence of cleaned housing sections to ensure that healthy pigs are transferred into nursery accommodation [ 34 ] . Moreover , studies suggest that increasing weaning age reduces stress associated with this period and allows pigs to have a more mature gastrointestinal tract and become increasingly familiar with solid feed during lactation with an improvement in growth performance and in immune response [ 34 , 35 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 335, "end": 359}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 919}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 212}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 511}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 828}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1171, "end": 1175}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
