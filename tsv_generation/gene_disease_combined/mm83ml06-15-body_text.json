To determine the replication capacity of HIV - 1 following infection with HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 or the field isolate 4lig7 , the respective replication profiles were depicted as diagram ( y - axis : RT activity ; x - axis : dpi ) . To calculate the arithmetic mean of the values obtained from experiments performed in HLAC from different donors the area under the curve of each replication profile was calculated and defined as the corresponding replication capacity . In every experiment the replication capacity of the untreated wt was set to 100 % and compared with the inhibitor treated samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 97}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 211}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
