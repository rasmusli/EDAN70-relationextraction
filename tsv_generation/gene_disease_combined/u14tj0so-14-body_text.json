Our method , Iterative HFold , takes a pseudoknot - free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any ( density - 2 ) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure . Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy , among all structures produced by these methods . While one of its underlying methods , HFold , strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis , the other three use iterations to extend or remove the base pairs of input structure , with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold . Thus , unlike HFold , iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure ( while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same ) . This is valuable since 1 ) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2 ) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle , there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some base pairs in the initially formed pseudoknot - free secondary structure can improve prediction [ 53 , 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 648, "end": 659}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1165}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
