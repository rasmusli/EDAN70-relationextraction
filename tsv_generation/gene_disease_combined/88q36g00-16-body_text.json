We and others have also previously demonstrated microglial activation , enhanced pro - inflammatory cytokine levels , including IL - 6 , and elevated oxidative damage in fetal brains 12 , [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] . In the MIA model , microglia play a major role , along with astrocytes , in synaptic pruning and neural circuit formation 2 . In addition , a single injection of IL - 6 is known to lead to the same behavioral abnormalities as those observed in the LPS models 66 ( IL - 6 is thought to be a key cytokine in the link between MIA and the behavioral deficits in the offspring 38 ) . In our previous report , maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased IL - 6 levels in the MIA fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the behavioral deficits later in life . Previous studies in adult rodents reported that H 2 treatment could mitigate the behavioral dysfunctions , including short - term memory deficits , cognitive impairments , and depressive - like behaviors , by regulating inflammation and ROS production 67 , 68 , which is in line with our current results . Moreover , the present study demonstrated that prenatal H 2 administration restored the MIA - induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss , and suppressed the excessive activation of astrocytes at postnatal 5 weeks . It was also shown that H 2 directly attenuated the LPS - induced expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including TNF - \u03b1 , IL - 1\u03b2 , and IL - 6 , in primary cultured astrocytes . These cytokines are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination in the neonatal rodent 69 . Thus , the suppressive effect of H 2 on both microglial and astrocytic activation would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes against LPS exposure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 329}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 355}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 695, "end": 702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 937}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1637, "end": 1666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1688, "end": 1696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1702, "end": 1709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1750, "end": 1760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 55}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 654}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 758}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 786}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 951, "end": 955}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1141}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1184, "end": 1206}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1814, "end": 1830}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
