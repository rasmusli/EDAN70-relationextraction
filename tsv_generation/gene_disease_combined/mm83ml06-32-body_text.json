While there is still a great medical need for continuous development of novel antiretroviral drugs [ 85 ] , the focus is currently on cellular targets that are genetically a million times more stable and thus harbor a much lower risk of drug resistance [ 86 , 87 ] . Small molecules , which affect cellular targets , offer a treatment alternative for interruption of cART in case of drug intolerance or development of multi - resistant HIV - 1 variants . In this study , we could provide first evidence that the DIs P22077 and PR - 619 not only block the replication of the HIV - 1 T cell culture adapted molecular clone NL4 - 3 , but also of the multi - resistant field isolate HIV - 1 4lig7 , which possesses resistance against all NRTIs and most of the protease inhibitors used in cART [ 50 , 51 ] . Moreover , we could demonstrate that structural treatment with DIs P22077 and PR - 619 on day 1 and 3 post infection can completely block spread of infection with similar efficacy as permanent treatment and without affecting cell viability . This indicates that a complete and comprehensive block in the production of progeny viruses , occurring early during spread of infection in the cell culture , must have been achieved by DI treatment that efficiently enables eradication of virus replication . One explanation for this observation might be the reduced infectivity of virions released under DI treatment , which is most likely due to impaired Gag processing . However , additional impact of DIs on HIV - 1 genomic RNA packaging , or the incorporation of the Env glycoprotein into budding virions , as well as on the activities of regulatory proteins , like Tat , Rev or Vif , might also account for this phenomenon .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1744, "end": 1748}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1799, "end": 1819}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1859, "end": 1876}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1931, "end": 1951}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1958, "end": 1962}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1964, "end": 1968}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1971, "end": 1975}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
