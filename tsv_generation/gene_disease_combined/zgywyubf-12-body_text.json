{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "12", "text": "In order to check whether the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was altered in ORF2 expressing cells , the level of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 ( ser32 ) was measured in ORF2 expressing cells . ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho I\u03baB\u03b1 ( Figure 2C , upper panel , lane 1 and 2 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below ) as well as the level of total I\u03baB\u03b1 ( middle panel , lane 1 and 2 ) . In IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 co - expressing cells , the level of total as well as phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly higher as compared to only IKK\u03b2 expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4 ) . In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 , one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG - 132 for 2 hours , resulting in equal I\u03baB\u03b1 protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6 ) . Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti - calnexin antibody to check equal loading . Thus , it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 . The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex . ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKK\u03b1 / \u03b2 ( ser180 / 181 ) levels . As expected , ORF2 expression ( 2 or 4 \u03bcg plasmid DNA transfection ) did not modulate the levels of pIKK \u03b1 / \u03b2 ( Figure 2D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 181}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 987}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1040}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1084}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1147, "end": 1152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1308, "end": 1321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1346, "end": 1351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1432, "end": 1443}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
