Here , we show that the active frameshift - stimulatory element in fact comprises a complex of viral nsp1 [UNK] and a cellular poly ( C ) binding protein . PCBPs have been shown to regulate gene expression at multiple levels , including transcription , mRNA processing , mRNA stabilization and translation ( reviewed in Refs . 25 , 26 ) . Hitherto , a role for PCBPs in protein synthesis has been limited to translation initiation , mostly in the recruitment of ribosomes to viral IRESes ( see Ref . 40 ) . Their activity in stimulating PRF in PRRSV is the first example of a role for PCBPs in modulating translational elongation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 100}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 600, "end": 613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 716}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 43}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
