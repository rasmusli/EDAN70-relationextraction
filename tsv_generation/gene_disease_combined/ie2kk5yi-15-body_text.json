We fit a single GLMM with an interaction between site and year to first test if prevalence varied over years across sampling locations ; we excluded one site from this analysis ( i . e . , LR6 ) owing to sampling in only 2015 . We included bat identification number ( ID ) as a random effect to account for multiple sampling of a small number of bats ( n = 6 ) . To assess seasonality in infection , we fit a separate GLMM with season ( spring , summer , fall ) as a predictor to data from two sites in Peru ( AM1 and CA1 ) sampled across seasons ( n = 63 ) . We also fit a generalized additive model ( GAM ) with restricted maximum likelihood , binomial response , and a cyclic cubic regression spline for Julian date using the mgcv package [ 61 ] . We randomly selected repeatedly sampled bats , as including bat ID as a random effect here overfit the GAM .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 198}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
