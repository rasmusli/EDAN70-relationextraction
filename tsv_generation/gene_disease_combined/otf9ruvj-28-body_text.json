In severe sepsis , B and T cells are depleted due to apoptosis [ 25 ] . Since our analysis is retrospective , we could not measure HLA - DR expression or cytokine profiles in these patients . However , we found a trend of increased lymphocytes in non - survivors compared to survivors , which may reflect why we did not see any beneficial effect of IVIG therapy . Although immunoglobulins may play an important role in the innate immune response during ARDS , nonspecific immunoglobulins may not be as effective in a lymphopenia environment . Lymphopenia has been described in ARDS patients and in animal models after viral infection or mycoplasma infection and affects all lymphoid tissue [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] . However , in our small group of [ 29 , 30 ] , but whether this variability in response is due to genetic alterations [ 31 ] , immune evasion by bacteria [ 32 ] , or different stages of sepsis is unknown . This study has some limitations . It is a retrospective analysis of a limited number of ARDS patients . Since we changed our ECMO system during the study period , we only included patients treated with the one system to exclude any impact of system differences . Furthermore , since IVIG was ordered by a physician primarily when a viral infection or MRGN infection was suspected , the IVIG group included more patients with these infections . However , this may reflect true clinical circumstances in that the cause of disease is typically not determined at admission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 16}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 98}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 539}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 610}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 636}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 663}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 699, "end": 715}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 739}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 979, "end": 986}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1331, "end": 1347}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1350, "end": 1365}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
