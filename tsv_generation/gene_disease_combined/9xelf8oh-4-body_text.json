In particular , quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) combines high - throughput sample processing with increased sensitivity and reduced potential for contamination ( Klein 2002 ) . However , PCR can be prone to inhibition in all formats ( Brankatschk et al . 2012 ; Schrader et al . 2012 ) and quality control is therefore vital during assay development and processing ( Borst et al . 2004 ; Burkardt 2000 ; Lo and Chan 2006 ) . One key quality control measure is to include an internal control ( IC ) to minimise occurrence of false - negative results . ICs that consist of a known DNA sequence , added to the sample prior to or post - DNA purification ( exogenous IC ) , are often convenient ( e . g . in commercial kits ) but may impair assay sensitivity ( Cai et al . 2014 ) . Alternatively , a region of the host ' s genomic DNA ( reference gene ) can be used as an IC ( endogenous IC ) to verify the absence of PCR inhibitors during sample processing ; using an endogenous control prevents the need to add foreign DNA to the qPCR and allows calculation of relative quantity of target DNA . Internal endogenous controls are frequently used in gene expression studies but rarely used in pathogen detection assays . Multiplex PCRs can be used to detect simultaneously the target and endogenous IC sequences and thus save time and costs ( Cai et al . 2014 ; Elnifro et al . 2000 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1036}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1253, "end": 1274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1276, "end": 1291}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1726, "end": 1750}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
