We set \u03b1 = 0 . 03 , which corresponds to a false alarm rate of one per month [ 2 ] . Then , as shown in the Appendix , the threshold , \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , is chosen by solving P ( D k , t > \u03c4 k , \u03b1 ) = \u03b1 for \u03c4 k , \u03b1 . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 - \u03b1 quantile of the { D k , t } process of non - outbreak - based training data , or via a normal approximation , given by ( 10 ) . There were some differences between the values of \u03c4 k , \u03b1 for the two methods in the simulations we studied . We chose the normal approximation method as it tended to preserve the specificity across the filters and EDs that we considered .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
