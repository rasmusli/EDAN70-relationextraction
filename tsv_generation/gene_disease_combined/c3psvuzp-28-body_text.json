Our results raise compelling hypotheses for the function of rapidly evolving PARP genes in these conflicts , and highlight the insights that can be gained from evolutionary analyses of previously poorly characterized genes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 92}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 552}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
