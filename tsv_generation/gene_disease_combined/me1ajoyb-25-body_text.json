Activation of TLR / RIG - I pathways leads to the expression of several miRNAs [ 98 ] that likely are important in lymphocyte functions [ 99 ] . Because hantavirus Gn targets RIG - I [ 61 ] , it is possible that these miRNAs are dysregulated , which could provide the virus an advantage over the host cell response . While miRNA expression has been evaluated in hantavirus - infected human endothelial cells , epithelial cells and macrophages [ 100 , 101 ] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of miRNAs in reservoir host cells infected with hantaviruses . Considering the importance of miRNA in host responses , it is likely they play an instrumental role in the immunological events leading to persistent infection of the reservoir hosts . The use of RNA - Seq can identify global miRNA expression [ 102 ] and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 193}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 443}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 915}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 487}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 668, "end": 681}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
