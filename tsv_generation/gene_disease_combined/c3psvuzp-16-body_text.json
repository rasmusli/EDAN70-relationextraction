{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "16", "text": "In order to further pinpoint which domains and codons in the macro - PARP genes have evolved under positive selection , we sequenced additional macro - PARP orthologs from a diverse panel of primates . Combining these with publically available sequences , we aligned and analyzed 15 or more orthologs for each macro - PARP gene ( Table S1 , Figure S4 ) . Based on these expanded alignments , we confirmed the results of our initial screen ; all macro - PARP genes have evolved under positive selection in Figure 1A . The region of the protein corresponding to human exon 30 is bracketed in red . Also shown below the schematic is an amino acid identity plot calculated using seven publicly available primate PARP4 sequences . ( B ) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection from seven publically available PARP4 sequences using the entire gene , exon 30 alone or the entire gene except exon 30 . Columns are as in Figure 1B Table S3 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1004403 . g002 simian primates ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS p - value , 0 . 01 ) . In contrast to the recurrent positive selection on only a single exon of PARP4 , we found that positively selected sites were broadly distributed throughout the macro - PARP genes ( Figure 3A ) . For all three macro - PARPs , we observed strong evidence of positive selection acting on the macrodomains . However , removal of the macrodomain - containing segments did not result in a loss of positive selection signatures , indicating that both macrodomains as well as other domains have evolved under positive selection ( Figure 3B ) . For instance , we found significant evidence for positive selection in the PARP domain of PARP14 ( Figure 3B ) , similar to PARP13 [ 37 ] . In contrast , our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection acting on the PARP domains of PARP9 and PARP15 ( Figure 3B ) , although it is possible that sequencing of additional orthologs might reveal more subtle signatures of selection . Thus , we conclude that macro - PARPs are evolving very rapidly , including substantial positive selection in the macrodomains of all three macro - PARPs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 167}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 301}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 574}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 708, "end": 714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 829}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 871}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 911}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1025}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1048, "end": 1055}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1157}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1408, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1523, "end": 1536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1690, "end": 1702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1705, "end": 1712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1746}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1842, "end": 1855}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1858, "end": 1864}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1868, "end": 1875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1945, "end": 1955}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 2030, "end": 2044}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2120, "end": 2133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2146, "end": 2160}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
