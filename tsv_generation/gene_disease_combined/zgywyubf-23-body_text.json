In an infected cell , by default , pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells . This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection . Thus , it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step . In fact , downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post - translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Since NF - \u03baB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell , inhibition of the NF - \u03baB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage ; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 97}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 366}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 626, "end": 638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 919}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 968}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 980, "end": 1006}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
