Of these , we re - analyzed the 133 that yielded a negative result , now using the aliquot that had been frozen at - 70 \u00b0 C and transported on dry ice to Norway . This was done at the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control , University Hospital of North Norway , Troms\u00f8 , Norway , using the Hexaplex Plus assay and an automated extraction platform ( NucliSens \u00ae easyMAG , bioM\u00e9rieux , Durham , NC , USA ) . Nucleic acids were extracted from 400 \u03bcl of sample , negative and positive processing controls and amplification control using the extraction principle with magnetic particles of this platform .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 545}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
