Of them , identification of risk factors for MERS - CoV infection , a comprehensive understanding of natural animal reservoirs and vectors , and better determining transmission pathways seem to be paramount in developing appropriate interventions . Priority should be given to addressing these questions if we hope to improve public health response to future index cases in new geographical areas . It seems prudent to allocate resources to further globally enhance surveillance to quickly identify MERS - CoV and to monitor for viral genetic changes as well as to conduct the necessary epidemiological studies to fill the aforementioned gaps in our knowledge regarding this new and dangerous threat .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 112}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 626, "end": 637}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
