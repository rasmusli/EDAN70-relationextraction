Under these conditions , cell lysates displayed a robust expression of all viral proteins tested . When viruses were analyzed , no notable variations were observed in the amount of Gag and Env present in the different preparations produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs ( Figure 2A for a WB analysis and Additional file 1 : Figure S1B for a precise quantification of gp120 and p24 by ELISA ) . Surprisingly , IFITMs were detected in viral preparations , suggesting that they could be virion - associated proteins . Next , we produced HIV - 1 viral particles in the presence of a variable amount of IFITMs by transfecting different amounts of IFITMcoding DNAs for a constant amount of Gag - Pol and Env DNAs . Purified virion particles were then normalized by exo - RT and either analyzed by WB ( Figure 2B ) , or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells ( Figure 2C ) . IFITMs were incorporated in a dose dependent manner in virion particles and the infectivity of virion particles decreased proportionally to the levels of IFITMs incorporated , overall suggesting a dose response inhibition of IFITMs on viral infectivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 24}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 408}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 595}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 864, "end": 881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 929}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1082, "end": 1089}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1307, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
