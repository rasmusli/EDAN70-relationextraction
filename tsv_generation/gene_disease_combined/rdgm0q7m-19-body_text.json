{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "19", "text": "RNA binding by the PRRSV PRF trans - activators was investigated using EMSAs . A short ( 58 nt ) 32 P - labelled transcript encompassing the minimal PRRSV frameshiftstimulatory region was incubated with nsp1 [UNK] , PCBP1 ( or PCBP2 ) or both proteins , prior to electrophoresis on a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel . As shown in Figure 4A , a single RNA - protein complex was observed , the formation of which required both nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP1 ( or PCBP2 ) . Using a broader range of PCBP2 concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1 [UNK] , the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . In the presence of PCBP2 , the PR mutant of nsp1 [UNK] was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the WT protein , but the RBM mutant gave a smeary pattern , indicative of weak , non - specific , RNA binding ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . As a control , a version of the RNA probe mutated in the C - rich region ( CC2 , Ref . 18 ) was also tested , and no nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 binding was evident ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . A supershift assay was carried out to confirm nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP association with the RNA in the complex . The PRRSV RNA was incubated with nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA . As shown in Figure 4B , in lanes from reactions with an added anti - PCBP2 monoclonal antibody , an additional band of slower mobility was seen consistent with the presence of PCBP2 in the RNA / protein complex . A monoclonal antibody targeting the NTD of nsp1 [UNK] did not yield a novel EMSA product , but a more slowly migrating species was observable with a polyclonal anti - nsp1 [UNK] serum . These observations support the view that the RNA / protein complex seen contains both proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 48}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 95}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 222}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 667}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 686, "end": 697}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 767}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 777, "end": 788}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 934}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 971}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1028}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1124, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1139, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1190, "end": 1200}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1234, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1385, "end": 1418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1499, "end": 1505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1512, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1538, "end": 1558}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1590}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1703, "end": 1708}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1767, "end": 1789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 34, "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
