{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "17", "text": "NF - \u03baB is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes during different cellular conditions . One of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of viral peptide epitopes over the infected cell surface , Further , we checked NF - \u03baB recruitment to the MHC I heavy chain promoter in LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay . Immunoprecipitation was conducted using an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF - \u03baB complex . EGFP expression did not alter p65 recruitment to MHC - I heavy chain promoter . However , full - length or \u039435 - ORF2 expression decreased p65 recruitment to the MHC - I heavy chain promoter . 10 % of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample ( Figure 5B , upper panel ) . We also checked p65 recruitment to interleukin 8 ( IL - 8 ) proximal promoter region , which showed a similar pattern as observed for the MHC - I heavy chain promoter ( Figure 5B , lower panel ) . As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF - \u03baB , aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti - SP1 antibody ( specific for SP1 transcription factor , which also binds to MHC - I heavy chain promoter ) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC - I heavy chain promoter specific primer . As expected , SP1 recruitment to the MHC - I heavy chain promoter was not altered in ORF2 expressing cells ( Figure 5C ) . These experiments confirmed that ORF2 expression specifically prevents p65 NF - \u03baB association with its cognate response element present on natural promoters .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 8}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 248}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 550}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 695}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 714, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 891, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 960}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1143, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1217, "end": 1237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1343, "end": 1352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1376, "end": 1405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1437, "end": 1441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1460, "end": 1489}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1584}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1621, "end": 1629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1686, "end": 1704}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
