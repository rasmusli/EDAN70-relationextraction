For example , the role of the TLR - TRIF and TLR - MyD88 pathway in pathogenesis and viral recognition . Furthermore , most studies were performed using LGTV and TBEV , and although they are closely related to POWV , LIV , KFDV , and OHFV , their interactions with the innate immune response might differ . Although IFN has been shown to strongly control viral tropism and pathogenesis of tick - borne flaviviruses , few antiviral ISGs have been identified . Viperin has been shown to be the most important ISG in cortical neurons , however , other ISGs that target TBEV expressed in astrocytes and granular cell neurons are yet to be identified and very little is known about the early response against the hemorrhagic TBFVs . We also know very little about how the innate immune response regulates the neuroinvasion of neurotropic TBFV , and the specific interactions between the tick vector and the different viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 181}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 460}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 651}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 689, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 555}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 848, "end": 866}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 978}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
