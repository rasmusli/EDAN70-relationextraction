{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "22", "text": "From the lack of effect of the KH2 mutation on PRF , we conclude that interaction of this domain with RNA does not occur ( or is unnecessary for PRF ) and that mutations within the GxxG loop of KH2 do not compromise the specific interaction with nsp1 [UNK] . However , the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA , and conceivably , with nsp1 [UNK] . EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding , which was reduced in the case of PCBP2 KH1m , abolished with PCBP2 KH3m and largely unaffected for PCBP2 KH2 ( Figure 5E ) . Similar results were seen with PCBP1 ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . To assess the capacity of the various PCBPs to bind nsp1 [UNK] independently of RNA , a pull - down assay was utilized ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Here , immobilized GST - nsp1 [UNK] was incubated with individual His - tagged PCBPs and , after a detergent wash , bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting . In comparison to WT PCBP2 , the binding of PCBP2 bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] was unaffected , indicating that the effects on PRF are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with nsp1 [UNK] . Indeed , PCBPs 1 - 4 all bound nsp1 [UNK] in this assay , thus the inability of PCBP4 to trans - activate PRF at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation . Importantly , GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] RBM was able to pull - down PCBP2 , indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 149}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 511, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 559}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 612}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 705}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 876}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 991}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1138}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1280}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1411, "end": 1435}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1463, "end": 1469}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
