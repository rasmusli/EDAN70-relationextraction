After virus purification and normalization , viral particles were used to challenge HEK293T cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards . Under these conditions , viruses produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity that ranged from 90 % in the case of SIV MAC - VSVg to 40 % in the case of HIV - 1 - GALV or HIV - 1 - RD - TR . IFITM3 seemed to exert a lower effect on the infectivity of MLV - VSVg in comparison with IFITM1 and \u2212 2 , yet this defect was clearly detectable and statistically significant . Overall , these results indicate that the expression of IFITMs during the phase of viral particles production impairs the infectivity of the retroviruses tested here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 883}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1033}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1116, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1127, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 188}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 241}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 522}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 556}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
