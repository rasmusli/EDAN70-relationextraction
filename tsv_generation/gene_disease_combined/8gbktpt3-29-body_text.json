{"cord_uid": "8gbktpt3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6950618", "divid": "29", "text": "The entire VP2 region of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 was amplified from 113 suspected cases of FPL , comprising 93 from Australia , 11 from Dubai and 9 from New Zealand . Amino acid substitutions compared to the FPV reference strain are listed in Table 5 . All VP2 sequences in this study were identified as FPV , with no cases attributed to CPV . Phylogenetic analysis of these VP2 sequences in comparison to a background global data set of FPV sequences revealed the presence of four distinct clades of Australian viruses ( Figure 6 ) . The first , denoted clade A , comprises 19 viruses ( 17 of which were identical ) sampled from a wide geographic area ( Melbourne , Geelong and Mildura ) between 2014 and 2017 . In contrast , Australia clade B comprised just two identical sequences sampled in NSW in 2015 . These viruses were detected in the faeces collected from two cats in the same shelter in Sydney , NSW , in November 2015 . Both cats had severe diarrhoea and tested positive for Salmonella spp . and Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 on a multiplex faecal qPCR panel ( Idexx Pty Ltd . ) . The largest Australian clade ( C ) comprised 66 viruses from NSW and one from Queensland , collected between December 2016 and February 2018 . Viruses collected from cats in North Western NSW ( Gunnedah ) and South Eastern Queensland ( Nambour ) in 2017 were identical to those sampled from cats from four shelters and from privately owned cats in Sydney . Viruses from cats from the NSW Central Coast also fell into this clade . Finally , one sequence isolated from a cat from Melbourne in 2018 ( FPV _ 251 ) was identical to viruses in clade C , with the exception of a mutation at position 694 ( A694G ) that resulted in an amino acid substitution I to V . This mutation was also present in viruses in Clade A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 22}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 275}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 99}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 346}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 957, "end": 967}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 1002}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
