The identification of this epitope , and the availability of the MVA - MERS - N candidate vaccine , will help to evaluate MERS - N - specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine - mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS - CoV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 299}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 617}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
