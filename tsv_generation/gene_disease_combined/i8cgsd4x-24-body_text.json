Microarray studies have also shown that several ubiquitin - related genes are induced following infection in mosquito cells [ 32 ] . The ubiquitinproteasomal pathway is one of the major pathways involved in post - translational modifications , leading to degradation of proteins . It has also been implicated in various stages of viral infection in mammalian cells including virus entry , replication and exit [ 49 ] . The largest family of ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) is a group of proteins that contain a RING domain , a structural motif comprising eight cysteine and histidine residues that form the interface with E2 ( ubiquitin conjugating ) enzyme [ 18 ] . Substrate specificity is determined by variant RING ubiquitin ligases and also by multiprotein complexes that contain a conserved RING protein . Cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are one such family of proteins , containing eight mammalian members , each with different substrate specificity [ 22 ] . These proteins have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell - cycle regulation and cell signaling . Because of this , cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are frequently targeted by viruses to evade host immunity [ 33 ] . Viruses redirect these ligases to select specific host proteins for degradation in order to prevent the host response and promote viral replication and dissemination . For example , viruses have been shown to use cullins to prevent cellular apoptosis by degrading p53 [ 50 ] or inhibit the innate antiviral response by blocking interferon signaling [ 30 ] . In mammals , interferon is a key component of a major innate defensive response against invading viruses by activating Jak - STAT pathway and the expression of antiviral genes in neighbouring cells [ 51 ] . Some members of the Paramyxoviridae have been shown to hijack cullin4A ubiquitin ligase complexes to overcome the interferon response , by promoting degradation of STAT proteins . Specifically , the V protein of simian virus 5 causes degradation of STAT1 [ 29 ] , while the parainfluenza virus V protein causes degradation of STAT2 via the Cul4A substrate adaptor DDB1 [ 52 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 779, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 802}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 842, "end": 854}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1045, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1141}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1143, "end": 1173}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1431, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1741, "end": 1749}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1792, "end": 1796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1856, "end": 1867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1899, "end": 1910}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 2009, "end": 2016}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 2046, "end": 2062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 2155, "end": 2164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 163}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 187}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 209}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 236}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 258}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 281}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 306}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 329}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
