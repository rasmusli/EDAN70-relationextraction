For instance , longitudinal studies of regional bat populations will aid in identifying shared threats to bats and human - mediated factors associated with increased disease emergence risk , both of which will likely change over time . Yet few bat research networks actively incorporate capacity building and hands - on - training in disease surveillance ; however , the Red Latinoamericana para la Conservaci\u00f3n de los Murci\u00e9lagos ( RELCOM ) identifies emerging diseases as a conservation priority [ 79 ] and the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Unit ( SEABCRU ) provides protocols on personal protective equipment and safety when conducting bat disease surveillance [ 80 ] . The Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats ( EUROBATS ) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop of public health officials , bat experts , and veterinarians to coordinate otherwise disjunct surveillance efforts for European bat lyssaviruses ( EBLV ) in several European countries [ 81 ] . This workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on Bats and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for EBLV surveillance programs in all European countries . Taken together , collaboration is required among diverse experts , including bat conservationists , public health officials , and virologists , in order to build impactful One Health research agendas and formulate effective recommendations to mitigate shared regional threats to bat populations and human health .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 83}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 758}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1181, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1253, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
