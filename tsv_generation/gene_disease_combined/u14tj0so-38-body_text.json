Following the description of each method , we motivate why we chose to include it as part of our overall algorithm . Iterative HFold takes as input both an RNA sequence , S and a pseudoknot - free secondary structure , G ; later we show that structure G can be produced by computational methods , for example , HotKnots hotspots or SimFold suboptimal structures , when only the sequence S is initially available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 456}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
