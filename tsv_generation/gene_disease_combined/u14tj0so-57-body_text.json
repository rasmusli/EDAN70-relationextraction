{"cord_uid": "u14tj0so", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4064103", "divid": "57", "text": "As mentioned in Section ' Background ' , in the literature on hierarchical folding , there are reports of counter examples to the hierarchical folding hypothesis where bases that are initially part of the pseudoknot - free structure for a molecule later change as the pseudoknot forms . This motivates a comparison of HFold versus Iterative HFold , in order to see how a method that sticks strictly with the hypothesis ( i . e . , HFold ) compares with a method that allows for some base changes ( i . e . , Iterative HFold ) . In Section ' Robustness comparison ' , we compare the robustness of HFold and Iterative HFold with respect to partial information ; that is , the degree to which they provide accurate predictions as a function of how much http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 information about G big , the true pseudoknot - free secondary structure , is provided as input . Then in Section ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold ' we compare HFold , HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold when a ( possibly inaccurate ) computational prediction of G big is provided as input . In Section ' Accuracy comparison with existing methods ' we compare Iterative HFold - the method that performs best overall in Sections ' Robustness comparison ' and ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold ' with existing methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction . Sections ' Running time comparison ' and ' Memory consumption comparison ' report on the running time and memory usage of our methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 602}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 616, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 836}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 885}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 992, "end": 998}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1006, "end": 1015}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1029, "end": 1035}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1094, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1201, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1336, "end": 1342}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
