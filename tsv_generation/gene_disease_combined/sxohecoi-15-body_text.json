However , the effect of FcRnmediated transcytosis on IgG alone does not appear as strong as the effect on IgG immune complexes , where , for example , with complexes made with 50 mg / ml of VRC01 or 2F5 , there was about an 8 - fold increase in transcytosis under conditions allowing FcRn engagement . This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6 . 0 and pH 7 . 4 ; IgG thus internalized can engage FcRn in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells [ 41 ] . The internalization of immune complexes , on the other hand , likely depends primarily on FcRn engagement at the surface of the cell at pH 6 . 0 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 226}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 458}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 543, "end": 547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 641}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 763}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 813, "end": 818}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
