Therefore , by necessity , recombinant ZIKV - Env protein ( rZIKV - E ) was generated to support the assays performed in this study . To generate this reagent , a consensus ZIKV - Env sequence based on the ZIKV - prME vaccine consensus antigen was cloned into a pET30a Escherichia coli expression vector ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . The rZIKV - E antigen was produced in E . coli cultures , purified using nickel column chromatography and analysed using SDS - PAGE , which showed overexpressed proteins of the predicted size in lysate from rZIKV - E transfected bacteria that could be detected by western analysis using an anti - His tag antibody ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . The sera from mice immunised with the ZIKV - prME vaccine bound to rZIKV - Env that was used as a capture antigen in an ELISA ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; Supplementary Figure S2C ) . A commercial antibody ( designated panflavivirus ) that reacts to the Env protein of multiple flaviviruses , also bound to rZIKV - E . Western analysis demonstrated that immune sera from ZIKV - prME immunised mice specifically recognised rZIKV - E ( Supplementary Figure S2D ) . These data indicate that the generated rZIKV - E reacted specifically with immune sera from ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice , thus this recombinant protein was used for further immunogenicity studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 248}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 535}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 937}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1123, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1371, "end": 1381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1464, "end": 1484}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
