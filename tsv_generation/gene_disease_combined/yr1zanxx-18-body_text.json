In the CNS , virus was first detected in the olfactory bulb ( Fig . 2e ) , then sequentially in more caudal regions including the cortex ( Fig . 2f ) , cerebellum ( Fig . 2g ) , brainstem ( Fig . 2h ) , and spinal cord ( Fig . 2i ) . Compared with control - treated animals , PLX5622 - treated mice exhibited higher viral titers in the olfactory bulb and cortex at 6 and 8 dpi and in the cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord at 8 dpi ; however , viral titers were also significantly higher in peripheral tissues of PLX5622 - treated mice including the spleen at 4 dpi ( Fig . 2j ) , kidney at 4 and 6 dpi ( Fig . 2k ) , and serum at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi ( Fig . 2l ) . PLX5622 treatment did not cause increased BBB permeability in infected mice ( Additional file 5 ) . Once WNV - NY enters the CNS via intracranial ( i . c . ) inoculation , PLX5622 treatment did not affect neuronal permissivity to infection ( Additional file 6 ) . Together , these data indicate a loss of immune - mediated virologic control in both peripheral and CNS tissues in CSF1R antagonist - treated mice , consistent with prior data suggesting that CSF1R signaling plays important roles in the function of both peripheral and CNS myeloid cells [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1458, "end": 1464}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
