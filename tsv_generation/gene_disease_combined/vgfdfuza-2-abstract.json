However , the multifaceted nature of AMR often complicates the development and implementation of comprehensive policies . In this study , we describe the policy context and explore experts ' perspectives on the challenges , facilitators , and strategies for combating AMR in Singapore . We conducted semi - structured interviews with 21 participants . Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed thematically , adopting an interpretative approach . Participants reported that the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) has effectively funded AMR control programs and research in all public hospitals . In addition , a preexisting One Health platform , among MOH , Agri - Food & Veterinary Authority ( restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency and the Animal & Veterinary Service under NParks in April 2019 ) , National Environment Agency , and Singapore ' s National Water Agency , was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore ' s AMR strategies . Nonetheless , participants highlighted that the success of AMR strategies is compounded by various challenges such as surveillance in private clinics , resource constraints at community - level health facilities , sub - optimal public awareness , patchy regulation on antimicrobial use in animals , and environmental contamination . This study shows that the process of planning and executing AMR policies is complicated even in a well - resourced country such as Singapore . It has also highlighted the increasing need to address the social , political , cultural , and behavioral aspects influencing AMR . Ultimately , it will be difficult to design policy interventions that cater for the needs of individuals , families , and the community , unless we understand how all these aspects interact and shape the AMR response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 25}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 367, "end": 371}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 644}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1073}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1145, "end": 1149}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1479, "end": 1483}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1688, "end": 1692}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1898, "end": 1902}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
