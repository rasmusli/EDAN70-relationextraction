A primary function of NOSTRIN is to modulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) by sequestering eNOS away from the plasma membrane ( Zimmermann et al . 2002 ) . In turn , this prevents the calcium - mediated release of nitric oxide ( NO ) ( Zimmermann et al . 2002 ) , a potent modifier of cardiac function , including regulation of contractility ( Massion et al . 2003 ; Petroff et al . 2001 ) . Alternative splicing of Nostrin produces a truncated isoform ( NOSTRIN - b ) which is primarily localized to the nucleus ( Wiesenthal et al . 2009 ) and represses transcription from its own promoter ( Kim et al . 2005 ; Wiesenthal et al . 2009 ) . Therefore NOSTRIN - b could also influence transcription of other genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network . A model can be envisaged where NOSTRIN - b alters expression of RBM20 ( the linkage peak for the Rbm20 eQTL contains Nostrin ) , leading to altered splicing of Nostrin ( as well as other key myocyte genes ) , to provide feedback from stretch - induced NO release and result in altered contractile properties . Interestingly , RBM20 has been shown to directly influence alternative splicing of Zfp451 and Ttn ( Guo et al . 2013 ) , both of which were identified as candidate upstream regulators in the other two eQTL peaks identified in this study . The eQTL interval located at Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network : Rab23 and Zfp451 . Since a defined relationship exists between ZFP451 and cardiac function , we suggest that ZFP451 is the better candidate . Z has been shown to bind directly to SMAD3 / 4 which prevents recruitment of p300 to target promoters and results in the downregulation of transforming growth factor - b ( TGFb ) target genes in A549 lung epithelial cells ( Feng et al . 2014 ) . This is relevant since transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of TGFb 1 were shown to develop atrial but not ventricular fibrosis and had increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation ( Nakajima et al . 2000 ; Verheule et al . 2004 ) . Upregulation of TGFb 1 is also known to induce myocardial hypertrophy ( Parker et al . 1990 ) and is evident in animal models of heart failure ( Dobaczewski et al . 2011 ) . However , therapies which block TGFb would be expected to have adverse effects due to the pleiotropic nature of TGFb signaling ( Dobaczewski et al . 2011 ) . In future studies , it will be important to determine if ZFP451 expression in the pulmonary myocardium and heart of atrial fibrillation patients is altered in parallel with increased TGFb expression ; if so , this transcription factor might be a viable therapeutic target .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 877}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 888, "end": 906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 920}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1103, "end": 1115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1243, "end": 1255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1276, "end": 1282}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1309, "end": 1320}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1329, "end": 1337}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1372, "end": 1380}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1417}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1538, "end": 1544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1605, "end": 1612}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1616, "end": 1620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1686, "end": 1706}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1723, "end": 1728}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1765, "end": 1770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1874, "end": 1908}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1910, "end": 1916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1920, "end": 1927}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1973, "end": 1980}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2019, "end": 2026}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 2052, "end": 2054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 276}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
