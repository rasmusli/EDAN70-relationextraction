These particles are called air droplet nuclei . They are invisible to the naked eye . Droplet nuclei can remain airborne in room air for many hours , until they are removed by natural or mechanical ventilation . For TB to spread , there must be a person with TB disease who produces the TB bacilli , and another person who inhales the droplet nuclei containing the bacilli . Although TB is not usually spread by brief contact , anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 3}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 358}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 409}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 429}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 526}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
