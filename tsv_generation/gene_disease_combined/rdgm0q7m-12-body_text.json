Test proteins were diluted where necessary in dilution buffer ( DB ) ( 5 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 05 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol ) and added to reactions ( 10 l final volume ) alongside electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH7 . 6 , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM adenosine triphosphate , 5 % glycerol , 100 g / ml porcine tRNA , 10U RNase inhibitor per ml ) , after which the radiolabelled probe was introduced . After incubation at 30 \u2022 C for 10 min , samples were loaded promptly onto 4 % acrylamide non - denaturing gels ( acrylamide : bisacrylamide ratio 10 : 1 ) and run at 175V at room temperature until free and bound RNA species were resolved . Gels were fixed for 15 min in 10 % acetic acid , 10 % methanol , dried and exposed to X - ray film .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 275}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 342}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
