Transfer of ADP - ribose ( ADPr ) from NAD + ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) to proteins is catalyzed within eukaryotic cells by members of the PARP ( poly - ADP - ribose polymerase ) , or ARTD ( ADP - ribosyltransferase , diphtheria toxin - like ) protein family ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 5 ] . The best - studied PARPs , including the founding member PARP1 , catalyze the formation of long , branched chains of ADP - ribose known as poly - ADP - ribose ( PAR ) [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . These PAR - forming enzymes perform critical housekeeping functions , such as nucleation of DNA - damage foci ( PARP1 and 2 ) and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis ( PARP5a ) [ 7 , 8 ] . In contrast to these well - described functions , most human PARP proteins are poorly understood , in part due to their lack of conservation in model organisms such as C . elegans and D . melanogaster [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] . In total , 17 genes in the human genome contain PARP domains , with each gene containing a variety of other functional domains that likely endow each PARP with their individual functions ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 10 ] . Many of the poorly - characterized human PARP proteins are found in the cytoplasm [ 11 ] and are predicted to only catalyze addition of a single ADPr , rather than PAR , to proteins [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] . Several recent descriptions of PARP functions in cellular signaling , miRNA regulation and stress granule formation [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] suggest that many functions for cytoplasmic ADP - ribosylation , especially mono - ADP - ribosylation , likely remain uncharacterized . Moreover , the discovery that a subset of macrodomain containing proteins can , in addition to binding mono - ADP - ribosylated proteins , also remove mono - ADP - ribose from proteins [ 15 , 16 ] , sheds further light on the regulation and function of this dynamic PT .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 301}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 341, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 657}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 813}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 902}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1093, "end": 1106}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1200}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1294, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1423, "end": 1427}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1489, "end": 1494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1830, "end": 1864}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1993, "end": 1996}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
