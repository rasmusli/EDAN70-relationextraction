{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "42", "text": "Numerous studies now indicate that polymorphisms in genes encoding the cardiac transcription factors NKX2 - 5 and PITX2C increase susceptibility to atrial fibrillation ( Huang et al . 2013 ; Qiu et al . 2014 ; Wang et al . 2014 ; Xie et al . 2013 ) , suggesting the potential involvement of disrupted gene networks in this disorder . Both factors are required for development of the pulmonary myocardium ( Mommersteeg et al . 2007 ; Ye et al . 2015 ) , which is also thought to have a pathological role in atrial fibrillation ( Chen et al . 1999 ) . A large body of literature has also been amassed to show that variants in genes regulating calcium handling lead to arrhythmia ( Table 6 ) . However , how the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker activity in atrial fibrillation patients is still unknown . Further , the underlying molecular identity of the pulmonary myocardium , including which ion channels and transcription factors are expressed in this tissue , has not been described in detail . We have used a systems - genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneously without prior knowledge of their identity , and have attempted to shed light on the relationships between transcriptional regulation , ion / calcium handling , contractile phenotypes , and the gene networks involved . By correlating variation in gene expression and known BXD genotypes in a genome - wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associated with the expression of a cardiac gene network in the pulmonary myocardium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 110}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 935}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1300, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1446, "end": 1462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1498, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 168}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 526}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 677}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 778}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1379, "end": 1383}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
