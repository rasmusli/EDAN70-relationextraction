{"cord_uid": "btuoin6d", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC7033854", "divid": "24", "text": "To date , little data has been reported on the characteristics of fever during Adv infection , especially in immunocompetent patients . In this study , we compared the characteristics of fever in Adv and Non - Adv group patients . The Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever and a higher proportion of peak body temperature than patients infected with other various viral respiratory pathogens or unknown pathogens . Similarly , Ho et al [ 22 ] observed that viral mono - pathogen patients had a higher mean body temperature than bacterial mono - pathogen patients . In addition , dualpathogen patients , such as S . pneumoniae with either influenza A or B , had a higher mean body temperature , although not significantly different from the respective mono - pathogens . However , there is still a lack of detailed data on the specific pathogen - related clinical characteristics , especially fever , in immunocompetent patients . Thus , our data is more likely to aid physicians in determining further diagnostic or therapeutic considerations at the time of admission . We also evaluated the response to antipyretic treatment between the Adv and Non - Adv groups . Our data showed that the Adv group patients exhibited a higher proportion of individuals with no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non - Adv or unknown pathogen group patients . Weisse et al . [ 23 ] evaluated the effect of acetaminophen on fever in bacterial vs . viral infections in 100 children . They concluded that there is no correlation between a fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the fever , revealing no usefulness in the response to antipyretic treatment in predicting etiologies of pneumonia . However , our data suggest that there may be a difference in the antipyretic response to Adv compared to other etiologies , and this is the first such data reported for immunocompetent adults .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 72}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 93}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 285}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 404}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 910}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1445, "end": 1458}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1605, "end": 1611}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1706, "end": 1716}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
