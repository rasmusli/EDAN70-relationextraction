Consistent with published data [ 8 , 49 ] , 30 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 4 PFU and 90 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 2 PFU ; however , mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer ( Fig . 2a ) . This was associated with significantly increased weight loss ( Fig . 2b ) and more severe clinical score ( Fig . 2c , d ) in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU WNV - NY .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 156}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 575}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
