Neutralization of IFNa in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro . Since the primary source of virus - induced IFNa in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ' s ) , we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation . Depletion of pDC ' s in vivo eradicated both the LDV - induced IFNa response and lymphocyte activation . A primary receptor in pDC ' s for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll - like receptor 7 ( TLR7 ) pattern recognition receptor . Infection of TLR7 - knockout mice revealed that both the IFNa response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo . Interestingly , virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC - depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFNa response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 89}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 678}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 693, "end": 698}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 742}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 800}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 862}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 994, "end": 999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 113}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
