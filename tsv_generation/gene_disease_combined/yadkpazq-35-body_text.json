{"cord_uid": "yadkpazq", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3537549", "divid": "35", "text": "In comparison to ODN of other groups , CpG - A have been used in much fewer studies concerning innate antiviral responses . This is most likely the result of the more time consuming and costly manufacturing process of these molecules linked to the synthesis of the flanking poly ( G ) strings necessary for optimal immune effects [ 31 ] . Also , CpG - A exhibit only weak stimulation of B cells , which produce antibodies that are valuable in later antiviral responses . Stability of CpG - A in vivo has also been questioned due to the only partial phosphorothioate backbone of these molecules . This can be partially compensated however , by the formation , through association of their poly ( G ) stretches , of highly ordered Gtetrad structures with enhanced stability [ 12 ] . Their smaller content in synthetic backbones could moreover help reduce possible long - term side effects [ 79 , 80 ] . Most importantly , CpG - A remain the most potent inducers of type I IFN , themselves the most biologically active antiviral molecules known to date [ 19 ] . With regard to this , a recombinant feline type I IFN marketed in both Japan ( Intercat \u00ae ) and Europe ( Virbagen Omega \u00ae ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for FCV , FHV , FeLV and canine parvovirus infections [ 67 , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of FPV [ 87 ] . However , when compared to direct initiation of antiviral mechanisms by a recombinant IFN\u03b1 protein , administration of CpG ODN holds the advantage of inducing the production of all type I IFN and their subtypes , which have been shown to possess differential antiviral properties and kinetics [ 88 ] . Our data demonstrate that five viral species belonging to the Calicivirus , Herpesvirus , Parvovirus , Coronavirus and Retrovirus families were highly sensitive to the immunologic effects of ODN 2216 in feline cells . Strength and breadth of antiviral defense mechanisms induced in vivo by this molecule have the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 293}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 963, "end": 974}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1083, "end": 1113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1499, "end": 1524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1544, "end": 1552}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1611, "end": 1617}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 2082, "end": 2098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1102, "end": 1113}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1231, "end": 1248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1281}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1412, "end": 1416}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1789, "end": 1842}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
