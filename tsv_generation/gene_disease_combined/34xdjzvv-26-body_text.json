Both 1 - day and 7 - day old mice were inoculated with 1610 7 pfu of live E59 and 3610 5 pfu live 5746 virus isolates subcutaneously ( s . c . ) . For protection studies , the purified neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 ( 20 ml of 10 mg / mL ) were injected intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) into the mice after 3 , 24 , and 48 h after infection . Mice were observed for symptom development for 10 days post virus infection . The severity of HFMD - like and paralysis symptoms was scored from 0 to 5 using the following criteria : For HFMD - like symptoms 5 = 80 % hair loss associated with scurf ( white spots ) ( HLS ) , 4 = 50 % HLS , 3 = . 30 % HLS , 2 = . 10 % HLS , 1 = , 10 % HLS and 0 = no HLS on the back and abdomen . To score the degree of paralysis , 5 = severe RNA was extracted from the brain , spinal cord , and muscles of 5746 - infected 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody , and antibody - untreated mice as described in Fig . 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT - PCR specific to ( A ) IFN - a , ( B ) IFN - b , and ( C ) IFN - c . The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b - actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig . 7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis .

The tested animals were euthanized by 100 % CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation after completion of the experimental protocol or when weight loss of 20 % occurred ( according to the guidelines of approved animal - use protocols ; protocol no .
