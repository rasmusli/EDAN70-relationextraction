Sequence data was obtained from amino acid 76 through the end of the N protein coding region . One amino acid substitution , F80L , differentiated the 2003 - 10 samples from the 1995 - 96 samples ( Table 2 ) . The samples from 2000 also had an F at residue 80 but differed from the other Humboldt samples at residue 106 with D replaced by G . A subset of the 2009 - 10 samples from southernmost region of the outbreak area and collected early in the outbreak ( foxes 5 , 2 , and 20 ) had an N to S substitution at site 119 . P protein . Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples primarily according to date , with limited grouping according to geography . Only one amino acid change , R30K , differentiated the 2003 - 10 samples from 1995 - 96 samples ( Figure S3 ) . This residue lies in a conserved region of the protein [ 21 , 22 ] . The samples from 2000 differed from the 1995 - 96 at two sites , R86K and E156G , and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K . Sequence data for the P protein was available for other CA skunk samples in GenBank including one from neighboring Trinity Co . collected in 1997 ( V650 CASK ) ; all had an R at site 30 , thus the R30K change is unique to the 2003 / 10 outbreak . , the G open reading frame had low coverage due to difficulty obtaining PCR products for this region ( Figure S1 ) . The primers for this project were designed prior to availability of genomic sequence for the CA skunk variant , thus making primer design especially problematic for variable regions of the genome . This likely impacts the number of subconsensus variants detected in this region .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 73}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 600, "end": 610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 862, "end": 879}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1110}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1264}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1331, "end": 1352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1510, "end": 1527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1607, "end": 1624}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1143}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
