For the LOD and LOQ determination , the working standard solutions at different concentrations were injected into HPLC from the highest to the lowest concentrations . The concentration with the smallest detectable peak , at a noise - to - signal ratio of 3 , was taken as the limit of detection ( LOD ) , whereas the lowest concentration with acceptable accuracy and precision at noise - to - signal ratio of 8 was taken as the limit of quantification ( LOQ ) . The linearity of the calibration curve was evaluated by linear regression analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
