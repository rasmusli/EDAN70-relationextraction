We therefore investigated the impact of these alarmins which could be potentially released by JEV - infected epithelial cells . To this end , we tested the effects of human recombinant IL - 25 , IL - 33 , and TSLP on macrophage infectivity by JEV . These experiments showed Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals . Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P [UNK] 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama , respectively ) ; differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P [UNK] 0 . 05 ; * * , P [UNK] 0 . 002 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 129}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 226}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 561}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 577, "end": 582}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 102}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 462, "end": 466}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 862}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 989}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
