The data suggested that the full - length core protein and the new NS3 protein ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) were suitable for analyzing the presence of antibodies against individual HCV proteins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from chronic HCV infection . These results are in agreement with those of previous studies in which the putative nucleocapsid protein ( C ) and non - structural proteins ( NS3 ) were found to contain the most immunodominant epitopes ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 372, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 738}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 795}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 506}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 567, "end": 589}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
