Whereas , MERS spike antigen were positive in epithelial layers of submucosal bronchial glands , lungs of NHPs and in some cells in BALTs [ 53 ] . Dual Immunohistochemistry method was applied using monoclonal antibody against MERS spike protein and CD26 , the staining showed that MERS was found in CD26 positive cells but were negative in NHPs [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 146}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
