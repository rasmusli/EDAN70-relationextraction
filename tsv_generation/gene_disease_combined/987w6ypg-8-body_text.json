{"cord_uid": "987w6ypg", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4251951", "divid": "8", "text": "Given that IFITMs are typical interferon - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) and that the signature of a broad antiviral type I interferon response accompanies HIV - 1 replication both in vivo and ex vivo [ 27 , 28 ] , we reasoned that IFITMs may be present not only in target cells , but also in virus - producing cells during the de novo assembly of virion particles . Therefore , we explored the role that IFITMs may play in HIV - 1 producing cells . The results we have obtained indicate that IFITMs coalesce with the structural protein Gag and are incorporated into HIV - 1 viral particles both in established cell lines , as well as in primary human monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM ) . Virions incorporating IFITMs display decreased infectivity when compared to HIV - 1 wild type particles in single round infection assays and a similar inhibition is observed for different retroviruses and Envelope ( Env ) pseudotypes . Virions incorporating IFITMs display a defect at the step of viral entry into target cells that well correlates with the infectivity defect measured here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 60}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 67}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 401, "end": 408}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 496}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 537}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 711, "end": 718}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 954}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
