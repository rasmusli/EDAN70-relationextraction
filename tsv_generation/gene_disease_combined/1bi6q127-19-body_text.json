Suppression of the immune response holding active virus replication in check would allow the virus to replicate to higher levels . This could happen in stressful conditions that affects the immune system . In other animals , a variety of stressors lead to reactivation of latent herpesviruses as reviewed by Grinde [ 48 , 49 ] . In neurons latently infected by herpes simplex virus - 1 ( HSV - 1 ) , viral replication is inhibited by the recruitment of CD8 + T cells which secrete interferon - \u03b3 ( IFN - \u03b3 ) and suppress viral transcription factors via noncytolytic granzyme mediated degradation [ 50 ] . During stress , there is a reduction of HSV - specific CD8 + T cells capable of producing IFN - \u03b3 . This contributes to reactivation of the virus [ 51 ] . Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus - 68 ( MHV - 68 ) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [ 52 , 53 ] . Stressors , such as unfolded protein responses and hypoxia , can induce the expression of viral immediate early genes that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 775, "end": 783}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1066}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1119, "end": 1147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
