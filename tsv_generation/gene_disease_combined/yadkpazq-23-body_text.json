Only slight individual variability in gene induction was observed after 24 h stimulation of immune cells from adult cats ranging between 1 . 5 and 14 years of age ( Figure 2B - D ) . Overall , the mRNA expression profile Figure 2D ) . Moreover , all individual IFN\u03b1 subtypes tested were induced at similar levels in the cells of four adult cats from group 2 ( Figure 2E ) . Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA were also measured in most individuals of groups 2 - 4 , with IL - 6 more systematically increased than TNF\u03b1 . The cells from these cats indicated a typical Th1 orientation after stimulation , with enhanced transcription of IL - 12 in 9 / 10 and IFN\u03b3 in 6 / 10 animals , together with absent or only low induction of IL - 4 . Stimulation of PBMCs with ODN 2216 also created an optimal environment for NK cell activity , as indicated by the increases in mRNA expression of the NK cell stimulator IL - 15 by up to 20 - fold and of the NK cell effector Granzyme B by up to 7 - fold . The cells of those cats ( c08 , c09 , c12 ) that had most effectively proliferated ( Figure 1A ) and / or exhibited the strongest expression of co - stimulatory molecules ( Figure 1B - E ) following ODN 2216 stimulation also consistently expressed the highest mRNA levels of IFN\u03b1 , IFN\u03c9 , IL - 6 , Il - 12 , IL - 15 and Granzyme B . PBMCs of cat c08 ( group 2 , Figure 1B ) were also by far most responsive to stimulation with ODN 2216 . When cells from kittens of group 1 were stimulated , higher individual variability was observed than in adult animals ( Figure 2A ) . The PBMCs of only 2 out of 4 cats from this group could be stimulated with ODN 2216 to increase mRNA expression of the tested genes . In both individuals , not only the mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was enhanced at much lower levels than observed in adult cats but the overall immune response favored a Th2 direction , characterized by upregulated IL - 4 and downregulated IL - 12 mRNA levels ( Figure 2A ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 725}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 883}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1134}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1200, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1386}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1433, "end": 1444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1608, "end": 1635}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1746, "end": 1751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1753, "end": 1760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1762, "end": 1770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1772, "end": 1780}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1784, "end": 1795}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
