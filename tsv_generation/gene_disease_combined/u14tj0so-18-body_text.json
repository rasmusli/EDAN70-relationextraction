Throughout this work , we consider only cases where each base may pair at most with one other base , and represent base pairing between i and j by i . j . We define a secondary structure , R , as a set of pairs i . j , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n ; i . j and k . j can belong to the same set if and only if i = k .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
