The PPI test was carried out as described previously 80 with the SR - LAB system ( San Diego Instruments , San Diego , California ) . Briefly , after habituation for 10 min , the animals received 10 startle trials , 10 no - stimulus trials , and 40 PPI trials . Each startle trial consisted of a single 120 dB white noise burst lasting 40 msec . The PPI trials consisted of a prepulse ( 20 msec burst of white noise at 69 , 73 , 77 , or 81 dB intensity ) followed , 100 msec later , by the startle stimulus ( 120 dB , 40 msec white noise ) . The total session lasted 17 min . The resulting movement of the animal in the startle chamber was measured for 100 msec after the startle stimulus onset ( sampling frequency 1 kHz ) , rectified , amplified , and input into a computer , which calculated the maximal response over the 100 - msec period . The basal startle amplitude was determined as the mean amplitude of the 10 startle trials . The PPI was calculated according to the following formula : 100 \u00d7 [ 1 \u2212 ( PP \u00d7 / P120 ) ] % , in which PPx was the mean of the 10 PPI trials ( PP69 , PP73 , PP75 , or PP81 ) and P120 was the basal startle amplitude .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1114, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1121, "end": 1126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1161, "end": 1169}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
