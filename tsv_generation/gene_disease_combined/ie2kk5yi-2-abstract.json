Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections ; however , the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown . Here we studied the genetic diversity , prevalence of infection across seasons and years , individual risk factors , and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) in Peru and Belize , for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported . Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR - positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico , other Neotropical bat species , and streblid bat flies . Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America , implying limited spatial structure . Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites . The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism , but nearly all infected bats were infested , which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector - borne transmission . While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples , we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces , suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact ( i . e . , biting ) and environmental ( i . e . , fecal ) exposures . Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact , environmental , and vector - borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 650}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1405, "end": 1420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 198}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1129}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1193, "end": 1218}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
