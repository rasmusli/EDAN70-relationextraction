{"cord_uid": "0pmo3opx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5431086", "divid": "18", "text": "The development of targeted agents for APN has been greatly hindered by two factors - the incomplete understanding of APN substrate specificity and , until recently , the paucity of high - resolution atomic structures . Here , we have presented the most comprehensive examination of the substrate specificity of APN to date and detailed the key structural interactions that dictate this specificity . By understanding the molecular architecture of APN at the atomic level and investing its specificity with our global profiling technique , we were able to rationally design peptide inhibitors of its enzymatic activity . The S1 pocket of APN has hydrophobic walls with an open end resulting from the presence of Met349 , Phe467 and Tyr472 . As predicted from the S1 architecture , the P1 specificity of APN favored hydrophobic residues . Amino acids with large positively charged side chains ( such as arginine and lysine ) are also tolerated as substrates because their side chains can form hydrophobic and polar interactions with aforementioned residues in the S1 pocket . In contrast , acidic residues ( glutamic acid and aspartic acid ) and short - branched residues ( such as asparagine and proline ) are strongly disfavored in the P1 position due to charge and VDW repulsion , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 316}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 635}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 638, "end": 642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 766}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 788}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 807}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1063, "end": 1073}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 43}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
