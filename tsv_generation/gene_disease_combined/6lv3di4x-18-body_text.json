In addition , epithelial cells also contribute to innate antiviral responses through the production of cytokines , chemokines , and IFNs ( 55 ) ( 56 ) ( 57 ) . To also address mucociliary activities , we used well - differentiated primary NEC cultures and demonstrated that JEV infects epithelial cells from nasal mucosal explants as well as NEC cultures ( summarized in Fig . 10 ) . Despite the fact that respiratory viruses are normally shed only apically and rarely basolaterally , JEV is shed to both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelial cells and such an infection could thus mediate virus entry into the host as well as oronasal virus spread to other hosts in a manner principally comparable to that of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus . Our in vitro results complements previously published in vivo findings , which can explain the high efficiency of JEV infection of pigs via the oronasal route and are in line with different experiments which showed oronasal shedding several days beyond the end of viremia , and they additionally can explain the detection of high levels of JEV RNA in nasal mucosa , which can last up to 10 days after challenge ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) . The in vivo relevance of the presented data is further supported by the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs , it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia ( 9 ) , pointing to a local cellular source for virus replication , which is also supported by a recent study in which the larger JEV RNA amount was detected in nasal mucosa ( 11 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 342}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1314, "end": 1322}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1802, "end": 1810}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 56}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 928, "end": 948}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 956, "end": 972}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
