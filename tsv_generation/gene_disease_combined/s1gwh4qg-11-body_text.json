SNAD accepts IDs from five databases ( Table 1 ) including GenBank ( gi or accession number ) and UniProt ( accession number or entry name ) that are automatically recognized in and extracted from the input data prepared in several formats : as part of tree ( ' newick ' and ' nexus ' ) and alignment ( ' fasta ' , ' msf ' , ' clustalw ' , ' nexus ' , ' phylip ' , ' mega ' and ' stockholm ' ) or supplied as a plain list ( Figure 2 ) . Examples of IDs , unique and non - unique , in alignment , tree , and plain list are available for testing purposes . SNAD may accept input with non - unique IDs , e . g . Gen - Bank accession number or locus name , that are most popular among researchers . Since these IDs may be associated with multiple entries , SNAD must decide which entry is to be used to retrieve annotation . The adopted approach is to use the most recent entry that might be not the one the user aimed at to retrieve annotation . The user may request automatically generated ID - to - name log ( see below ) for checking the quality of the conversion . To ensure unequivocal ID processing the user must use UIDs in input . UIDs from one database can be used to query another non - cognate database in which it may be not recognized at all or recognized as non - unique IDs ( The user has a choice of reading SNAD output either on the \" Execution \" web page , or at a separate web page in plain text mode , or receiving it via e - mail . For tree input , SNAD generates , additionally to the standard output , a respective tree drawn to facilitate visual inspection of the generated names in graphic format . The web page output can be enhanced with links to cognate entries accessible through the generated names .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 624}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 684}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 710}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 822}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1385, "end": 1390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1536}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
