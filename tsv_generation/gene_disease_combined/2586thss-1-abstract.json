A series of different recombinant HCV proteins in Escherichia coli cells were constructed , expressed , purified and the new DAS - LFIA strip was developed . The sensitivity and specificity of new the DAS - LFIA strip were evaluated by detecting 23 HCV - positive sera , a set of quality control references for anti - HCV detection that contain known amounts of anti - HCV antibodies , and 8 HCV - negative sera . A total of 300 clinical serum samples was examined by both the new DAS - LFIA strip and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Data were analyzed using SPSS 11 . 5 software . The sensitivity and specificity of the new DAS - LFIA strip were 100 % . The lowest test line of the HCV DAS - LFIA strips was 2 NCU / ml . Additionally , the concordance between the new DAS - LFIA strip and ELISA methods was 94 . 33 % . In conclusion , our new testing method is rapid , simple , sensitive and specifically detects the presence of anti - HCV antibodies in human serum or plasma . Therefore , it may be used for monitoring HCV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 394}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 750}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1226}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 80}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 86}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
