To test our hypothesis that 3D8 scFv acted as a DNase in the nucleus , we investigated whether 3D8 scFv could hydrolyze histone - bound DNA and methylated DNA . Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I at 10610 24 U / ml started to hydrolyze 0 . 2 mg DNA 1 hr after treatment . At a concentration of 8 . 3610 24 U / ml , 3D8 scFv digested more non - methylated DNA than methylated DNA after 1 hr of treatment ( Figure 6A ) . In addition , quantitation of nonmethylated and methylated DNA showed a reduction rate of 62 % and 21 % , respectively ( Figure 6C ) . However , no difference in hydrolysis of non - methylated and methylated DNA was observed when 8 . 3610 24 U / ml DNase I was tested ( Figure 6A ) . Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I did not digest DNA at a concentration of 1 . 4610 24 U / ml , regardless of whether it was methylated or not ( Figure 6A ) . We next tested whether the 3D8 scFv protein could digest histone - bound DNA in the nucleus . Histone - bound DNA fragments ( 150 bp ) were not hydrolyzed by either 3D8 scFv or DNase I at concentrations of 10610 24 U / ml and 8 . 3610 24 U / ml , as shown in Figure 6B . But , at concentrations of 8 . 3610 24 U / ml 3D8 scFv , DNA without histones was reduced 34 % and 90 % after 1 hr and 3 hr , respectively ( Figure 6C ) . Also , 3D8 scFv digested more DNA without histones than DNase I at concentrations of 8 . 3610 24 U / ml 1 hr after treatment ( Figure 6B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 157}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 278}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 473}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 762, "end": 770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 811}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 815, "end": 823}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1025}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1072}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1081}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1265, "end": 1274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1381, "end": 1390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1416, "end": 1425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1430, "end": 1438}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
