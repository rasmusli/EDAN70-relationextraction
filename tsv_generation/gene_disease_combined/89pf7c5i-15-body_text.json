In fact , the seroprevalence of Leishmania infection in cats is lower than in dogs from the same locations [ 23 , [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and a lower PCR prevalence in cats than in dogs is also reported from similar geographical areas [ 29 ] . Immune responses leading to natural feline resistance might account for the observed differences in the prevalence of infection in cats as compared to dogs . Studies evaluating Leishmania specific cellular immunity tests in cats could better estimate infection , but they are still lacking in cats [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 213}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 589}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
