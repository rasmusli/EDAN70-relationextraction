To test this , we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site - directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors . We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 63}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
