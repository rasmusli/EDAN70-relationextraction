The cells were collected at 48 hpt , washed two times with cold PBS , and lyzed with the CHAPS lysis buffer ( 1 % CHAPS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] ) containing 1 mM PMSF ( catalog no . ST506 ; Beyotime ) and 1 mg / mL protease inhibitor cocktail at 4 [UNK] C for 1 h . The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13 , [UNK] for 20 min at 4 [UNK] C . The clarified lysate was treated with a mixture of RNase A ( 25 U / mL ) ( catalog no . 2158 ; TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) and RNase T1 ( 1 U / \u00b5L ) ( catalog no . PF0059 ; Fermentas , Burlington , Canada ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to Co - IP analysis . The lysate was precleared with the Protein G - Agarose ( catalog no . 11243233001 ; Roche ) at 4 [UNK] C for 4 h followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4 [UNK] C for 4 h , and the Protein G - Agarose was then added and incubated at 4 [UNK] C for 2 h . The Protein G - Agarose was washed three times with PBS , and the bound proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 37}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 548}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 805}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 967}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1043}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1178, "end": 1189}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
