Reports do show increased IgA immune complexes and levels [ 9 ] , although immune complexes do not necessarily portend worse prognosis [ 98 ] . Peripheral lymphocyte analysis did not indicate an increase in IgA + cells in acute , subacute and convalescent KD patient samples [ 3 ] . In fact , there was actually a relative paucity of IgA + peripheral B cells from acute KD samples compared to controls . Interestingly , the lack of IgA + peripheral B cells continued through convalescence . Other studies have shown no changes in acute and convalescent B cell subgroups , but increases in CD69 + natural killer and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were observed [ 99 ] . Recently , the B cell marker CD 19 + was used to show an increase in both number of B cells and relative percentage in acute KD compared to controls . The percent of ' activated ' CD86 + B cells was also significantly elevated [ 100 ] . There was also a global increase in the ability of B cells to secrete IgM , IgG , and IgA after TLR - 9 stimulation , something that has been previously unexplored in the literature . Overall , in the small number of studies relating to the peripheral blood B cell compartment , there is not a consensus as to whether B cells are responsible for enhanced pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 151}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 788}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1060, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1076, "end": 1080}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 102}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 363}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 477}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 872, "end": 881}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
