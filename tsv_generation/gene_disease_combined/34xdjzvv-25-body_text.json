[ 43 ] to evaluate the cross - neutralization Figure 7 . Administration of N3 reduced pro - inflammatory chemokines expression in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746 - preinfected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice . RNAs were extracted from the brain , spinal cord , and muscle of 5746 - infected 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody , and antibody - untreated mice as described in Fig . 6 and were subjected to quantitative RT - PCR specific to ( A ) CXCL10 , ( B ) CCL3 , and ( C ) IL - 6 . The number of PCR cycles ( Ct ) required for fluorescent detection of target genes was calculated and presented as the relative expression after normalization with the internal control of b - actin expression from the same tissue . Each normalized 2 Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2 Ct obtained from the antibody - untreated tissues . A schematic representation of the target gene expression and the statistical average from 10 mice per group is shown . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis .

Serial diluted N3 ( 10 mg / mL ) were incubated with EV71 genotype B or C viruses ( m . o . i . = 0 . 5 ) at 37uC for 1 h . The mixtures were then inoculated into a monolayer of the 3T3 - SCARB2 cell line in a 6well plate at 37uC for 2 h . After absorption , the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , CA , USA ) following instructions provided by the manufacturer . Two sets of sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used for the detection of EV71 genotype B and C viruses . The primer sequences used to amplify genome expending from VP1 domain of the B4 and C2 virus were 59 - AGAGAGTCACTTGCTTGGCAGACA - 39 ( B4 _ F ) , and 59 - AC - GACTAGTGCCGGTCGGTTTAAT - 39 ( B4 _ R ) ; 59 - GCTAGT - GATATCCTACAGACAGGC - 39 ( C2 _ F ) , 59 - GGACTGCTGTCCAAATTTCCCGAG - 39 ( C2 _ R ) , respectively . The PCR was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 ml containing 2 ml of cDNA , 16 the PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ( each ) of deoxynucleoside triphosphates , 0 . 2 mM of each primer , and 2 U of FastStart Taq polymerase ( Roche , IN , USA ) . Amplification was conducted according to the following cycling program : denaturation at 95uC for 4 min , annealing at 52uC ( B4 ) or 57uC ( C2 ) for 30 s and elongation at 72uC for 3 min for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72uC for 7 min , all of which were performed in a 96 - well Veriti Thermal Cycler ( Applied Biosystem , MA , USA ) . The PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 1 . 2 % agarose gel containing SYBRH Safe DNA gel stain ( Invitrogen , NY , USA ) and visualized by ultraviolet light .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 195, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 448}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 573}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 581, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 805}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 998, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1857, "end": 1874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1912, "end": 1923}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
