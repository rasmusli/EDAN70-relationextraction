Our first data set is the test data set of Andronescu et al . [ 36 ] , that contains 446 distinct RNA sequences and their reference structures , of which 348 are pseudoknotfree and 98 are pseudoknotted . This set has four structures that are not in the class of structures our methods can handle ( i . e . , have densities higher than 2 [ 48 ] ) . Since the number of such structures is too small to be useful in an experimental analysis , we removed them from our set of pseudoknotted structures , resulting in a set of size 442 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 538, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
