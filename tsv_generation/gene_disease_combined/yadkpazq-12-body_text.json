During collection of the cells , the adherent cell fraction was removed with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco \u00ae , Invitrogen ) . Harvested cells were divided into 3 fractions labeled separately with either anti - feline B7 . 1 mouse monoclonal IgG ( kindly provided by Prof Mary Tompkins , Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Laboratory , NC State College of Veterinary Medicine , USA ) , anti - feline MHCII mouse monoclonal IgG1 ( Department of Pathology , Microbiology and Immunology , University of California , Davis , USA ) or fluoresceinisothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated mouse IgG1 as isotype control ( BD Bioscience , Allschwil , Swizerland ) . The fractions were subsequently stained with R - Phycoerythrin ( RPE ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG1 ( BioConcept , Allschwil , Swizerland ) . Fluorescence data was obtained using the FACSCalibur \u00ae instrument ( Becton Dickinson , Allschwil , Switzerland ) and the CellQuestPro [UNK] software . Gates representing lymphocyte and non - lymphocyte populations were set on the basis of forward versus side scatter , and a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the nonlymphocyte gate . Data was analyzed with the FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Olten , Switzerland ) , whereby an additional gate was set comprising both lymphocyte and non - lymphocyte populations ( PBMC gate ) . MHCII and B7 . 1 expression levels were determined as mean of fluorescence intensity for each gated cell population . Identical gates were set for all cats in such a way that they comprise the desired cell populations of each animal .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 611}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 881, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1517, "end": 1523}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1527, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
