However , most epidemiological studies have focussed on monitoring the effect of only one pathogen in the occurrence of this disease , and there is inadequate information concerning other relevant enteric pathogens such as viruses and parasites . Some investigations of mixed infections in PWD showed that rotavirus was considered to be an important enteric pathogen in weaned piglets with a prevalence of 77 . 5 % , followed by E . coli , coccidia , sapovirus and Cryptosporidium parvum with prevalence of 55 , 10 , 2 . 5 and 2 . 5 % respectively [ 48 ] . In addition , infection by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSv ) results in an impairment of the immune response of piglets , permitting ETEC to cause a septicemia leading to death [ 49 ] . However , these data were reported more than 10 years ago and are unlikely to reflect the current epidemiologic situation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 29}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 413}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 568}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 868}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
