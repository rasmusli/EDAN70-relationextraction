The rodent specific TRIM79\u03b1 was identified to interact with LGTV NS5 in a yeast two - hybrid screen . TRIM79\u03b1 expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of NS5 . Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to tick - borne flaviviruses as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by TRIM79\u03b1 nor did TRIM79\u03b1 interact with NS5 of WNV [ 147 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 188}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 469}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 503}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 414}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
