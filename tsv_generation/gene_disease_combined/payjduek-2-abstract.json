We report the unusual finding of BCG reactivation in an infant with laboratory - confirmed measles . Case presentation : A previously healthy 7 - month old infant presented initially with fever , cough and coryza , and subsequently developed Koplik ' s spots followed by a typical morbilliform skin rash . There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with measles . On examination , a 2 . 5 cm area of erythema and induration was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site , in addition to the widespread maculopapular rash . No other clinical features of KD were present . Measles virus was isolated from the throat swab and measles antibodies ( IgM ) were present in the serum . The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy , and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up . Conclusions : This case report highlights the rare finding of BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed measles infection , and suggests that this clinical manifestation may occasionally occur in children with infections or conditions other than KD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 940}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 94}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 236}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 241}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 439}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 447}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 458}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 504}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 526, "end": 549}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 652, "end": 660}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 707}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 711, "end": 722}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 800, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 854}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 877}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 929}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1218, "end": 1236}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1360, "end": 1363}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
