We first used HeLaP4 cells that express IFITMs at steady state . HeLa cells were challenged with miR30 - shRNAs specific for the 3 IFITMs or control target sequences ( luciferase ) , and shortly selected with puromycin . Then , cells were challenged with replication competent HIV - 1 ( NL4 - 3 at an MOI 1 ) to obtain a consistent amount of virus - producing cells . After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non internalized virus , cells were re - seeded and two days after , cells were lysed and newly produced viral particles were purified , normalized by exo - RT and used for a WB analysis , as well as to challenge target cells ( Figure 5A ) . As expected , downregulation of the intracellular levels of IFITMs led to viruses that incorporated less IFITMs . When the infectivity of exo - RT normalized viral particles produced from control versus IFITM knockdown cells was assessed , the formers displayed a statistically significant increase in infectivity ( two fold ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 205}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 449}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 692}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1014, "end": 1021}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1059, "end": 1066}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
