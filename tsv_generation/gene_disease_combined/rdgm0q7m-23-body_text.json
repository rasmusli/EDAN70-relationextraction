A hallmark of RNA structure - dependent PRF signals is the necessity to maintain a precise spacing between slippery sequence and stimulatory RNA to position the ribosome appropriately at the slip - site ( 38 , 39 ) . The importance of spacing in PRRSV frameshifting was assessed in WG translations programmed with reporter mRNAs with spacer lengths of 4 - 13 nt ( Figure 6 ) . Efficient PRF was seen over a narrow range ( 9 - 11 nt ) , with shorter spacers leading preferentially to \u2212 2 PRF and longer spacers preferentially to \u2212 1 PRF . This pattern of frameshifting is highly reminiscent of that observed with stimulatory RNAs and suggests that the nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP complex functionally mimics such RNAs . The optimal spacer length was subtly different for the two PCBPs , with maximal PRF ( \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 ) seen at longer spacer lengths for added PCBP1 compared with PCBP2 . Thus the capacity of the various PCPBs to promote frameshifting into a particular reading frame is likely set by the position and / or conformation of the protein complex on the template , affected by subtle differences in the position of KH domains within the proteins which influences ' effective ' spacer length .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 54}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 401}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 501}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 687}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 778, "end": 784}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 865}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 885}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 983}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1137}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
