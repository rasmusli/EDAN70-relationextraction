Interestingly , macrophages were found to be the primary target for POWV in the spleen [ 52 ] , and in the CNS , which is the main target site for POWV infection , neurons have been shown to be the primary target for POWV in mice and humans [ 52 , 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 38}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 134}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 526, "end": 531}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
