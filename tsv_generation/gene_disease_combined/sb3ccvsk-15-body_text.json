{"cord_uid": "sb3ccvsk", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5030268", "divid": "15", "text": "To directly assess whether elevated T cell activation is antigen driven or more polyclonal in nature , we measured the frequencies of both virus - specific as well as SR CD4 + T cells in CLN following Foxp3 + Treg depletion . Frequencies of virus - specific CD4 + T cells , as analyzed by IFN - \u03b3 secreting cells following viral peptide M 133 stimulation , were not altered in DTR + compared to DTR \u2212 mice ( Figure 3 ) . However , reflecting overall increased cellularity , their absolute numbers increased more than threefold ( Figure 3 ) . We next assessed how Foxp3 + Tregs regulate SR - specific CD4 + T cells in CLN . Similar to virus - specific CD4 + T cells , myelin - specific endogenous CD4 + T cells are activated in CLN , albeit at later times correlating with demyelination ( 13 ) . More importantly , APC presenting myelin Ag are present in CLN of chronically infected mice ( 13 ) . Analysis of SR IFN - \u03b3 - secreting MOG 35 \u2212 55 and MBP 60 \u2212 80 specific CD4 + T cell frequencies revealed a threefold increase following Foxp3 + Treg depletion compared to the very low frequencies in DT - treated DTR \u2212 mice ( ~ 30 cells per 10 6 CLN cells ; Figure 3 ) . Higher frequencies of SR T cells thus correlated with an overall ninefold increase of MOG 35 \u2212 55 and MBP 60 \u2212 80 specific CD4 + T cell numbers within the CLN of DTR + mice compared to controls ( Figure 3 ) . These data indicated that Foxp3 + Tregs unspecifically regulate overall CLN cellularity and T cell activation during JHMV persistence but specifically limit expansion of SR CD4 T cells emerging after onset of demyelination . ( 20 ) . Surprisingly however , Foxp3 + Treg depletion altered neither total CNS cellular infiltration ( Figure 4A ) nor frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes ( Figure 4B ) at d28 p . i . Percentages of CD11b + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells , including virus - specific CD8 + , all remained similar irrespective of Foxp3 + Treg depletion ( Figures 4C , D ) . T cell activation in the CNS cannot readily be deduced by their phenotype as the majority of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express a CD44 + CD62L low CD69 + effector phenotype throughout infection ( 27 ) . Nevertheless , as anticipated , we found no phenotypic T cell differences in DT - treated DTR \u2212 compared to DTR + mice ( data not shown ) . Similar overall T cell effector function was supported by identical levels of mRNA encoding pro - inflammatory cytokines IFN - \u03b3 and IL - 2 in both brain and spinal cord ( Figure 4E ) . No apparent differences in T cell numbers or function were also reflected in identical levels of persisting viral mRNA in both brains and spinal cords ( Figure 4F ) . These data indicated that viral persistence was not regulated by Foxp3 + Tregs , distinct from CLN . Finally , no overt differences in demyelination in Foxp3 + Treg ablated mice indicated a minor , if any , role of this Treg subset in CNS tissue damage ( Figure 4G ) . These data demonstrated that Foxp3 + Tregs control T cell activation and inflammatory responses within CLN but have no effect on CNS inflammation and pathology during chronic JHMV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 577}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 829, "end": 839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 951}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1039}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1041, "end": 1046}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1402, "end": 1416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1633, "end": 1639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1641, "end": 1646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1915, "end": 1921}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1923, "end": 1928}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 786}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 814, "end": 818}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1493, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1585, "end": 1599}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
