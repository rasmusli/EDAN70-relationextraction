Since the C value of both species is approximately 1 pg [ 12 ] , this background DNA represents a GMO level of 0 . 01 % for both Tnos and P - 35S assays . OSR DNA was used because we did not have any soya DNA free from RoundUp Ready [UNK] . DNA extracted from our 0 % CRM was shown to contain 0 . 002 % GMO [ 13 ] . The use of 100 ng of this sample would be equivalent to adding 200 copies of the transgene sequence , considerably more than the experimental input of 10 copies . We believe the use of OSR DNA to be a valid substitute since none of the primer sequences for either assay will be present in non - transgenic soya or oilseed rape .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 364}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 656, "end": 664}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 724}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
