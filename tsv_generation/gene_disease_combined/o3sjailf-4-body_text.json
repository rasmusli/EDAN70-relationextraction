She had no other symptoms , in particular no diarrhea , abdominal pain , vomiting or rash . Except for the elevated temperature , the patient ' s vital signs were normal ( the respiratory rate was 35 breaths / min ) , there was no sign of severe sepsis or respiratory distress , and the detailed physical examination did not reveal any abnormality . The caregivers responded negatively to questions about the presence of acute disease in contact persons or chronic disease in the child . The leukocyte count ( leukocytes 33 \u00d7 10 9 / L with a neutrophilic predominance ) , C - reactive protein ( 139 . 1 mg / mL ) and procalcitonin levels ( 5 . 772 \u00b5g / L ) were elevated . Other blood tests were within the normal range ( hemoglobin 9 . 7 g / dL , alanine transaminase 43 U / L , hematocrit 29 . 1 % and platelets 453 \u00d7 10 9 / L ) . The urine dipstick was positive for leukocytes , and thus the patient was treated with cotrimoxazole , but the urine culture was sterile . As mentioned , no viral , bacterial or parasitic agent was evidenced after a broad range of investigations , including blood culture . In particular , virological screening included the following specific real - time RT - PCR assays : influenza A and B ; respiratory syncytial virus ; metapneumovirus ; PIV types 1 and 3 ; rhinovirus ; enterovirus ; coronavirus ( HKU1 , NL63 , 229E and OC43 ) ; bocavirus ; adenovirus ; human herpesvirus 6 ; parvovirus B19 ; dengue ; chikungunya ; West Nile and Rift Valley viruses . She was also screened for antigen detection of adenovirus and rotavirus , and serological assays targeting IgM for Epstein \u2212 Barr virus , cytomegalovirus , hepatitis A and E , mumps and measles were performed . The clinical diagnosis retained was a tracheobron of unknown etiology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 790}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 966}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1795, "end": 1799}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 133}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 161}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 251}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 268}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 279}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 287}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 450}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 474}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 632}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 670}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1452}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1505, "end": 1517}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1629, "end": 1636}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1638, "end": 1650}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1652, "end": 1686}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1803, "end": 1824}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1826, "end": 1842}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1844, "end": 1862}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1864, "end": 1870}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 1874, "end": 1882}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
