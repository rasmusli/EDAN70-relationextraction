The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV , InfA , and PIV3 . RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics . The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several respiratory viruses , highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 221}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 261}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 373}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
