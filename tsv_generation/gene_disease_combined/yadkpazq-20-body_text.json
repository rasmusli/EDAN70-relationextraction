In relation to this , the potential of CpG - A to induce proliferation of feline PBMCs were assessed by measurement of 3 H - thymidine incorporation after stimulation . Although considerable variability was observed between individuals , a 2 - fold increase in proliferation was observed after stimulation with ODN 2216 when compared to stimulation with inactive control ODN 2243 ( p = 0 . 0281 , Figure 1A ) . The cells of three cats ( c08 , c09 , c12 ) could be stimulated to particularly high proliferative rates by ODN 2216 ( values above the mean of eight cats illustrated in Figure 1A ) in the following order : c08 > c12 > c09 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 291}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 970}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 976}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 982}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
