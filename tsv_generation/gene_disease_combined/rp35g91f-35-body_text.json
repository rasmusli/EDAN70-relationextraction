Therefore , all n 24 pulmonary myocardium gene network transcripts were merged into a single trait using PCA . A network of 100 probes that correlated ( r . 0 . 553 , P , 2 . 40e 205 ) with the synthetic PCA trait was identified .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 60}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
