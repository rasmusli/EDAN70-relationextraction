The studied demographic and lifestyle variables ( age , gender , education level , smoking status , contact to children , asthma , sports activity , dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs ) did only marginally affect ORs . However , adjustment for asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or a summary score covering all queried co - morbidities weakened the relationship between obesity and all outcomes considerably . Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available ( n = 508 ) , had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between obesity and RTI outcomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 77}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 96}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 313}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 455}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 495}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 502}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 603}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 800}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
