These E . coli carry the eae gene encoding a 94 kDa outer membrane protein ( intimin ) which is responsible for intimate attachment to epithelial cells . However , the pathogenic significance of porcine EAE positive isolates in weaned pigs is still unknown [ 2 ] . Furthermore , identification of porcine EPEC is difficult and many veterinary diagnostic laboratories do not routinely screen for this pathotype of E . coli , isolates of which do not usually possess any of virulence factors of classic PWD or oedema strains [ 40 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 280}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 47}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 196}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 412}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 710}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 720}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
