Pooled samples were DNAse treated and ribosomal RNA depleted , then cDNA synthesis was performed . Libraries were prepared using a KAPA DNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina ( KAPA Biosystems ) modified for low input samples , and were individually barcoded during the PCR reamplification step [ 10 ] . The libraries included in this study were combined in equimolar ratios with other metagenomic libraries for sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 201}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 579}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
