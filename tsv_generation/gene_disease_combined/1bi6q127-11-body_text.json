{"cord_uid": "1bi6q127", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6410205", "divid": "11", "text": "Several species of bats control inflammation by having a mutation at a highly conserved serine residue in one of the key adaptor molecules for sensing damaged DNA , i . e . , stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) , which reduces its functionality . STING senses damaged DNA or dsDNA from viruses and induces an interferon response . The replacement of serine at position 358 by other amino acids makes bat STING less effective in activating interferons [ 30 ] . In addition to possessing a less effective STING , the pyrin and HIN domain ( PHYIN ) genes , which are involved in microbial DNA sensing and formation of inflammasome , are absent in bats [ 21 , 31 ] . These findings demonstrate some of the reasons for reduced inflammation in bats during viral infection . Mechanisms to modulate inflammation may have evolved to mitigate the detrimental effects of flight . Excessive exposure to cytosolic DNA in bat cells during flight might have posed a strong natural selection pressure to reduce the activation of bat DNA sensors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 252, "end": 258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 415}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 456}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 633}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 910}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1034}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 771}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
