After the three - hour flight , laboratory - confirmed SARS developed in 20 persons and 2 others gave diagnoses of probable SARS [ 6 ] . The computational geometry of the airplane cabin with occupants was numerically constructed and meshed based on the outbreak case . As shown in Figure 1 ( a ) , a twelve - row , single - aisle , fully occupied cabin section was constructed for simulation . Seventy - two passengers including the index patient were seated in the cabin . A movable person stood at one end of the aisle . The dimensions of the numerical airplane cabin section were 4 . 58 m \u00d7 9 . 72 m \u00d7 2 . 20 m ( W \u00d7 L \u00d7 H ) with a volume of 68 . 85 m 3 . The origin of the coordinate system was located on the ground at the left corner of the cabin behind the standing person , and the coordinate system met the right - hand rule . Ventilation air was supplied from two longitudinal overhead slots ( 0 . 012 m W \u00d7 9 . 72 m L each ) located in the middle of the ceiling . The outlets were located along the lower longitudinal edge of the floor , one on each side . To represent the detailed profile of the occupants , a digital model was used , which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system . Detailed facial features such as head , shoulders and limbs were contained in this model , as shown in Figure 1 ( b ) and ( c ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 217}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 337}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 401, "end": 406}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
