Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor ( FcRn ) in human genital mucosal tissue [ 19 ] . FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins [ 20 , 21 ] . The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood [ 22 ] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation [ 23 ] . A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [ 24 ] . This pH - dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids , for example , cervicovaginal secretions , to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 336}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 476}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 604}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 663}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 690, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 707}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 851}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 48}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
