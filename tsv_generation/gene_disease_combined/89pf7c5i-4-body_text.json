Pet cats living in the same houses where human cases of cutaneous or visceral leishmaniosis were diagnosed were examined for the presence of Leishmania amastigotes in skin lesions or by post mortem histopathological evaluation of the bone marrow and spleen [ 3 , 4 ] . In Sicily ( southern Italy ) , no case of infection was found by cytological and histological examination of spleen , liver and bone marrow of 120 necropsied cats living in an endemic area [ 5 ] . The same negative results were obtained in Egypt when spleen cytology and culture were performed on 28 stray cats , and six of them displaying skin lesions were negative also from skin [ 6 ] . Conversely , in Jordan , amastigotes were detected in liver and spleen smears from about 20 % of 78 stray cats [ 7 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 110}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 204}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 276}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 734}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
