CVB3 commonly infects children , resulting in a self - limiting illness that can lead to the development of muscle , lung , and heart maladies . Importantly , CVB3 infection can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis , and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [ 1 , 2 ] . Currently , no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection ; thus , the identification of novel antiviral targets is crucial to controlling infection . Viral proteases , including enteroviral proteases , play crucial roles in the replication of RNA viruses [ 3 ] . Following virus entry , picornavirus RNA is directly translated via host ribosomes into a polyprotein , containing both structural and nonstructural proteins . This large protein is subsequently cleaved to generate functionally distinct viral proteins . Importantly , the ability of viral proteases to cleave the viral polyprotein is essential for productive infection , as limiting viral protease activity significantly hinders virus infection . Modulation of protease activity , however , can also alter antiviral susceptibility [ 4 ] . Additionally , viral proteins cleave several host proteins , including translation factors , immune effectors , and signaling molecules [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] , to establish a proviral environment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 573}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 711}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 828}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 922}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 969}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 1001}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1224, "end": 1239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1254, "end": 1268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1302, "end": 1319}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1325, "end": 1345}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 245}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 300}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 464}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
