After overnight cultivation at 37 \u2022 C the cell culture supernatant was harvested and VLPs released into the supernatant were pelleted through 20 % ( w / v ) sucrose by centrifugation ( 20 , 000 \u00d7 g , 4 \u2022 C , 90 min ) , washed with ice cold PBS , centrifuged ( 20 , 000 \u00d7 g , 4 \u2022 C , 90 min ) , lysed in SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) sample buffer containing 2 % SDS , and boiled for 5 min . The cells were detached and washed twice in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer , supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 5 mM NEM , and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete ( Roche ) . The samples were analyzed by western blotting . Protein bands were quantified using AIDA [ 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
