However , the best - fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma - distributed SEIR model ( m \u00bc 2 , n \u00bc 2 ) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ) : the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six ( up to the peak in incidence ) or more points are used . This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take - off ( k \u00bc 1 . 0837 d \u00c01 ) , and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4 . For the SIR model ( n \u00bc 1 , 1 / c \u00bc 2 . 2 d ) we obtain an R 0 of 4 . 38 whereas for the SEIR model ( m \u00bc 2 , n \u00bc 2 , 1 / r \u00bc 2 . 6 d , 1 / c \u00bc 2 . 1 d ) we obtain an R 0 of 16 . 9 . Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma - distributed SEIR model . Given that we are fitting an additional parameter , it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions . However , this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period , estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 45}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 166}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 957}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1155, "end": 1159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1226}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
