For example , Mathews et al . [ 45 ] used SHAPE reactivity data to improve the prediction accuracy from 26 . 3 % to 86 . 8 % for 5S rRNA of E . coli . Roughly , the larger the SHAPE reactivity value for a given nucleotide , the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure . However , limited SHAPE reactivity data is available , and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or , if it is paired , to what other nucleotide . Deigan et al . [ 46 ] created pseudo energy terms from SHAPE reactivity data , as a means of integrating such data into prediction software . They reported prediction accuracy of 96 % to 100 % for three moderate - sized RNAs ( < 200 nucleotides ) and for 16S rRNA ( 1500 nucleotides ) . ShapeKnots [ 47 ] is a new method for incorporating SHAPE reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al .
