As mentioned above , reinfection of the liver graft is universal and characterized by accelerated progression of liver disease . Furthermore , treatment of recurrent HCV infection after LT is compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies . In addition , poor outcome after graft reinfection of HCV has increasingly become a major problem faced by the hepatologists and transplant surgeons . Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic strategies of HCV reinfection are urgently needed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 269}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 322}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 638}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
