We begin by describing the normal processes of bacterial selection in the upper and LRTs and then present evidence on how these processes can potentially be altered by respiratory viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 90}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 275}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
