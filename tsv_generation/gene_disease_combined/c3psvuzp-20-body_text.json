{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "20", "text": "From our investigation of all seventeen PARP genes across a wide range of vertebrates , we found that PARP15 is unique in its pattern of recurrent loss ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , other PARP genes are present in all genomes we examined , with the exception of PARP10 , which has been lost in the carnivore lineage . To explore the dynamics of PARP15 birth and loss , we conducted a more in - depth survey of PARP15 genes in vertebrate genomes ( Figure S5 ) . We found that PARP15 was born early in mammalian evolution via a partial duplication of PARP14 , consisting of the second and third macrodomains and the PARP domain . We found that PARP15 has been independently lost via deletion or inactivating mutations in five different mammalian lineages ; PARP15 is therefore absent from gibbons , all glires ( rodents and lagomorphs ) , the cow / sheep / dolphin clade , alpaca / camel , and armadillo ( Figure 4B ) . Elephant and manatee have a conserved but shorter form of PARP15 , missing the first of the two macrodomains . In contrast to these losses in PARP15 , we identified several PARP14 duplications that occurred both within and outside the lineage that contains PARP15 . For instance , although fish and birds lack PARP15 orthologs , many fish and bird genomes have one or more additional copies of PARP14 that could possibly serve PARP15 - analogous functions . Guinea pig and bushbaby each appear to have at least one extra intact copy of PARP14 , with the caveat that in each case a single exon is within a genome assembly gap . The microbat ( Myotis lucifigus ) genome contains at least eight PARP14 / 15 genes , of which at least two copies are intact ( two additional genes are incomplete in the assembly but are uninterrupted in available sequence by stop codons or frameshifts , suggesting they are also intact ) ( Figure 4B ) . Moreover , pairwise comparisons of duplicated PARP14 genes in microbat and bushbaby suggest that these paralogs may have regions that have rapidly diverged under positive selection ( Figure S7 ) , although additional sequences will be required to strengthen such a conclusion . Coupled with our findings that both PARP14 and PARP15 are evolving under positive selection in primates ( Figure 3 ) , the gene turnover we describe for PARP14 and PARP15 supports the idea that these genes have been selected for functional innovation , perhaps in response to a recurrent genetic conflict with pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 556}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 606}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 762}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 983}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1014, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1060, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1091, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1228, "end": 1245}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1312, "end": 1319}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1345, "end": 1352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1610, "end": 1628}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1896, "end": 1909}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
