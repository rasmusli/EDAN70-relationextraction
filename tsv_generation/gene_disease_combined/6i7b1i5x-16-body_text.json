In a subsequent study , 26 % of the control group , composed primarily of adult patients , had similar inclusion bodies that were bound by antibody J [ 105 ] . Although many viruses can reactivate during stress ( Herpesviridae family ) or are considered ' slow ' viral infections [ 106 ] , the failure of numerous attempts to identify a specific infectious agent argues against such a persistent infection [ 57 ] . There remains the possibility that this is a difficult to culture virus , such as coronavirus , which had also enjoyed a short - lived consideration as the cause of KD [ 107 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 19}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 497}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 268}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 627}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 930}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
