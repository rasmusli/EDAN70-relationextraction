Briefly , 96 - well plates were coated with IFN - \u03b3 capture Ab ( BD Biosciences ) . Serial dilutions of cells were cultured for 36 h at 37 \u00b0 C in RPMI complete ( RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 - mM l - glutamine , non - essential amino acid , 1 - mM sodium pyruvate , 25 - \u03bcg / ml gentamycine , and 5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 M 2 - mercaptoethanol ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum in the presence of stimulator splenocytes preincubated with or without 1 - \u03bcM peptide ( M 133 \u2212 147 , GTVYVRPIIEDYHT ; MOG 35 \u2212 55 , MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK ; MBP 60 \u2212 80 , SHHAARTTHYGSLPQKSQR ; Bio - Synthesis , Lewisville , TX , USA ) . Spots were detected by sequential incubation with biotinylated anti - IFN - \u03b3 mAb ( BD Biosciences ) overnight at 4 \u00b0 C , horseradish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin ( BD Biosciences ) for 1 h at room temperature and 3 , 3 \u2032 - diaminobenzidine substrate ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Numbers of spots were determined using a CTL ImmunoSpot analyzer ( Cellular Technology Ltd . , Shaker Heights , OH , USA ) . Spots detected in wells with no peptide ( negative control ) were subtracted from spots formed in the presence of peptide and results presented as the number of IFN - \u03b3 secreting cells normalized to 10 6 input cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 733, "end": 737}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 935, "end": 982}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
