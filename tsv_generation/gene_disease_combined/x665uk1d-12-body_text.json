However , these viral protein targeting approaches are limited because they only target specific viruses and are susceptible to viral mutations . We describe a novel strategy that targets the viral genome itself , rather than viral gene products , to generate virus - resistant transgenic cells and animals . We functionally expressed 3D8 scFv which has both DNase and RNase activities , in HeLa cells and transgenic mice . We found that the transgenic cells and mice acquired complete resistance to two DNA viruses ( HSV and PRV ) without accumulating the virus , and showed delayed onset of disease symptoms . The antiviral effects against DNA viruses demonstrated in this study were caused by ( 1 ) DNase activity of 3D8 scFv in the nucleus , which inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and ( 2 ) 3D8 scFv RNase activity in the cytoplasm , which blocked protein translation . This strategy may facilitate control of a broad spectrum of viruses , including viruses uncharacterized at the molecular level , regardless of their genome type or variations in gene products . mutant line ( muSCH ) ( Figure 2A ) . The plaque assay revealed that SCH07072 cells produced the fewest number of viral progeny of 163 / ml at an MOI of 0 . 1 and 530 / ml at an MOI of 0 . 5 . The plaque assay data supported the GFP expression results showing the best antiviral effects among the three cell lines . In contrast to SCH07072 , wild - type HeLa cells had 1 , 343 / ml ( 8 . 24 times higher ) and 7 , 851 / ml ( 14 . 81 times higher ) viral progeny at MOIs of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , respectively ( Figure 2B ) . At an MOI of 0 . 5 , muSCH cells produced a viral titer that was 14 . 42 times higher than that of SCH07072 and was similar to that of wild type HeLa cells ( Figure 2B ) . Western blot analysis using an anti - HSV DNA polymerase antibody ( P / UL42 complex ) demonstrated that less HSV - 1 DNA polymerase was detected in SCH07072 cells compared to that of wild - type HeLa cell lines 48 hours after virus challenge ( Figure 2C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 486}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 616, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 656}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1001, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1592, "end": 1596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2086, "end": 2121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 2123, "end": 2125}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
