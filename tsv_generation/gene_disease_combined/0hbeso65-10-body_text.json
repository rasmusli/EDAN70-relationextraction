Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for HCV hepatitis after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [ 7 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Another study by Gayowski et al . reported in their results that the rate of recurrent HCV hepatitis , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to IFN therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT HCV hepatitis [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 38}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 229}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 637, "end": 651}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
