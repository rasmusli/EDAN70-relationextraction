However , several studies suggest that bacteria might play a role in wheezing in young children [ 9 , 10 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] . Moreover , it is increasingly appreciated that the human body is home to an extended microbiome , with asthmatic children harbouring different bacteria and a less diverse mix compared to healthy children [ 21 ] . Characterisation of the predominant bacteria in wheezing children is essential to understand the pathophysiology of persistent wheezing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 32}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 175}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 188}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 250}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 379}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 538}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 686, "end": 695}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
