{"cord_uid": "mm83ml06", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5580479", "divid": "35", "text": "There are mainly two possible explanations for the synergistic effect of DIs and proteasome inhibitors : First , the amount of free ubiquitin is significantly reduced by the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and the lack of recycling of polyubiquitin chains . This might interfere with the function of the ESCRT - complex as early acting ESCRT factors like ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , and ALG - 2 interacting protein X ( ALIX ) possess ubiquitin binding domains , and thus ubiquitin may play an important role in their substrate recognition [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] . Second , the addition of DIs together with proteasome inhibitors might lead to the accumulation of so - called defective ribosomal products ( DRiPs ) . DRiPs are de novo synthesized erroneous proteins , which are rapidly degraded via the UPS . Originally , it was shown that the HIV - 1 Gag protein is a bona fide substrate for the DRiP - pathway [ 94 ] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of DRiPs [ 38 ] . Combinatory treatment of cells with DIs might lead to a further enhancement of accumulated Gag - DRiPs within the cell . Thereby , those Gag - DRiPs interfere with virus release by disturbing the highly ordered assembly of Gag molecules in a prion - like manner [ 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 717}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 719, "end": 725}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 778}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 876}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 984, "end": 990}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1102}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1136, "end": 1148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1236}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
