Cytokine secretion profiles of the lymph node cells showed elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL - 2 and IL - 12 , which are known to promote proliferation of T lymphocytes and slow down the death of CD4 + T cells . The authors emphasize that these immunogenic properties of the conjugate could prove to be beneficial to the host .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 67}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
