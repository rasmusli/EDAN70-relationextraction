{"cord_uid": "vret3sh1", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3480482", "divid": "46", "text": "As indicated above , the improvement in sequencing speed and efficiency led to a rapid accumulation of genome sequences and necessitated more efficient methods for large - scale access to genomes , annotations , subsystems , and genome - scale models within the SEED database . A SOAP server was first developed to allow programmatic access to the SEED data [ 21 ] , but several performance issues prevented the service from scaling with the volume of data contained within the SEED database . The server abstraction layer required the loading of numerous large modules on each invocation of server functionality , resulting in a noticeable delay in response to each server request . The encapsulation of the results in SOAP XML conferred significant overhead on the data being transferred . Finally , each operation of the SOAP server was atomic , accepting a single argument and returning a single datum . Trivial requests such as retrieving all the functions for all of the proteins in a genome took unacceptably long to complete , requiring a separate call for each protein and instantiating many threads on the server . The four SEED servers described here provide programmatic access to the SEED data and methods . They expose the current data in a form that is conveniently accessed computationally . The installation and maintenance of the client - side software require minimal effort . We have constructed the underlying methods to support relatively large - grained data transfers , allowing the construction of relatively efficient programs . In comparison to the SOAP server [ 21 ] , the new web services provide access to larger amounts of data in less time , and they have been engineered to respond to server requests with little or no server - side delay . Furthermore , the new web services provide a more efficient and flexible computing approach because they are designed to process batches of requests at a time , streaming the responses as they complete . These services provide access to the integrated genomic data , subsystems , FIGfams , co - occurrence data , annotation services , RAST annotation submission and job retrieval ( thereby offering access to our continuing improvements in microbial annotation ) , and metabolic modeling . All client modules , code examples and documentation are available online at http : / / servers . theseed . org , and we are continually expanding these services and improving the underlying documentation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 276}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 829}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1197, "end": 1202}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1576, "end": 1581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 2026, "end": 2034}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 2054, "end": 2062}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
