So , detection of the potential causative agents is the prerequisite for proper treatment and viral detection can reduce the irrational and overuse of antibiotics . ARIs due to bacterial infections have become a global concern especially because of the emergence of an increasing number of multi - drug resistant bacteria . Although some studies have examined the viral etiology of ARIs in the under - five children in Bangladesh , information is lacking on bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance / sensitivity pattern [ 10 , 11 ] . Lack of information regarding etiological agents influences the use of inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotics which in turn fosters antimicrobial resistance . The purpose of this study was to examine both viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs among under - five children of Bangladesh in hospital settings over a period of 1 year . The viral pathogens were identified using RT - qPCR targeting 10 common respiratory viruses and microbiological culture method was used to examine pathogenic bacterial spectrum and determine their antibiotic susceptibility pattern .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 53}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 91}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 330}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 358}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 955}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
