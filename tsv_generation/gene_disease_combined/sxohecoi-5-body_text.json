The concentration of Env - specific IgG present in such secretions varies considerably from person to person and is usually on the order of 100 to 1 , 000 - fold less than concentrations found in plasma [ 18 ] . The presence of Env - specific IgG strongly suggests that some proportion of Env molecules on the surface of infectious virions in genital tract secretions is coated with IgG . Since HIV - 1 is successfully transmitted sexually , the coating antibody is either of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus infectivity upon contact with an uninfected partner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 194}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 480}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 616, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 152}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
