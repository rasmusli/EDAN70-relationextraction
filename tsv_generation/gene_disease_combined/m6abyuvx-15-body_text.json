To determine whether CD4 or CD8 T - cell activity was required for the reduction in HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice , we analyzed the core protein levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice immunized with rVV - N25 in the absence of CD4 or CD8 T cells ( Figure 4A ) . As expected , the mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in HCV core protein levels ( Figure 4B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 398}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 482, "end": 486}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 548}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
