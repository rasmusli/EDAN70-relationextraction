{"cord_uid": "yr1zanxx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6354430", "divid": "27", "text": "Recently , chronic activation of innate immune response by microglia is believed to be a major contributor to neurodegenerative conditions [ 72 ] . Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer ' s disease and multiple sclerosis , indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis , rather than a secondary response [ 73 ] . We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement - mediated synapse elimination [ 8 , 74 , 75 ] . Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation , researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function , including traumatic brain injury [ 38 , 39 ] , brain irradiation [ 50 ] , myelin - induced catatonia [ 76 ] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [ 40 ] , and Alzheimer ' s disease [ 41 ] . However , our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS , as well as decreased peripheral APC activation . Thus , in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism , it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and peripheral immune compartments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1227, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 139}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 255}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 287}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 310}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 817}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 885}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 936}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 971}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1179}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
