To this end , 150 \u03bcg equivalent IgG ( PRNT 50 \u2248 1 / 160 ) from week 6 RM were adoptively transferred into IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice 1 day after the ZIKV viral challenge . Two groups of control mice were included , one group receiving pre - immune sera from RM and the other group receiving phosphate - buffered saline Figure 6 . Single immunisation with the ZIKV - prME vaccine provides protection against ZIKV challenge in mice lacking the type I interferon \u03b1 , \u03b2 receptor . Mice were immunised once and challenged with 2 \u00d7 10 6 plaque - forming units of ZIKV - PR209 , two weeks post immunisation . The survival curves depict 10 mice per group per experiment ( a ) . The ZIKV - prME vaccine prevented ZIKV - induced neurological abnormalities in the mouse brain ( b ) . Brain sections from pVax1 and ZIKV - prME vaccinated groups were collected 7 - 8 days after challenge and stained with H & E ( haematoxylin and eosin ) for histology . The sections taken from representative , unprotected pVax1 control animals shows pathology . ( i ) : nuclear fragments within neuropils of the cerebral cortex ( inset shows higher magnification and arrows to highlight nuclear fragments ) ; ( ii ) : perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex , lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells ; ( iii ) : perivascular cuffing , cellular degeneration and nuclear fragments within the cerebral cortex ; and ( iv ) : degenerating neurons within the hippocampus ( arrows ) . An example of normal tissue from ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice appeared to be within normal limits ( v and vi ) . ( PBS ) . The mice that received PBS or control sera lost 15 to 25 % of their original body weight during the course of infection , and all died 6 - 8 days post infection . When vaccine immune sera from RMs were transferred to infection - susceptible mice , the animals lost weight on day 3 and 4 , but subsequently regained it beginning on day 5 and 80 % ultimately survived infectious challenge ( Figure 7a ) demonstrating the ability of the NHP sera transfer to confer protection against clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection following viral challenge ( Figure 7b ) . In repeated experiments performed to evaluate the efficacy of immune serum transfer in protection against challenge with ZIKV , the survival among ZIKV - prME immune sera recipients ranged from 80 to 100 % . These studies show that anti - ZIKV vaccine immune sera had the ability to confer significant protection against ZIKV infection in the absence of an acquired adaptive anti - ZIKV immune response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 691}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 370}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 628}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 925}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 935, "end": 962}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
