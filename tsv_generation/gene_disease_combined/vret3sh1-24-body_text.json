The Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server also provides the user with an API to remotely obtain a list of the models in the SEED and to download data on the compounds and reactions in each SEED model . The server returns the following data for each reaction in a specified model : ( i ) all data from the SEED biochemistry database , ( ii ) a list of the genes associated with each reaction in the model in a format that captures how the protein products encoded by the genes function to catalyze the reaction ( as either independent enzymes or multienzyme complexes ) , and ( iii ) a list of compartments in the model where the reaction takes place and the directionality / reversibility of the reaction in each compartment . For the model compounds , the server returns the data from the SEED Figure 2 . Entities and relationships in the SEED . The entities ( boxes ) are connected to each other by a series of relationships ( diamonds ) that describe how the two entities relate . To move from one entity ( e . g . , ' ' Identifier ' ' ) to another ( e . g . , ' ' DNA Sequence ' ' ) , the series of connections shown by the gray arrow is made . This way , any entity can be connected , either directly or indirectly , to any other entity . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0048053 . g002 biochemistry database . As with the biochemistry data , all the model data in the server are accessible either via Perl programs or the API .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 574}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 780}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1281, "end": 1294}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1507, "end": 1520}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
