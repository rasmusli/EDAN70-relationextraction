To determine whether CxCul4 plays a similar role during WNV infection , Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid expressing CxCul4 and infected with WNV 24 h post - transfection . Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using primers for Vir1 , a reporter gene regulated by Jak - STAT pathway [ 34 ] , and CxVago , a reporter gene regulated by the TRAF - Rel2 pathway [ 35 ] . As expected , expression of both CxVir1 and CxVago was upregulated following WNV infection . However , whilst there was no significant difference in CxVago expression following CxCul4 overexpression , CxVir1 upregulation was suppressed significantly in CxCul4 - overexpressing cells compared with empty vector transfected cells ( Fig 4A ) . Previous studies have shown that , once expressed , CxVago is secreted and activates the Jak - STAT pathway in Culex cells [ 7 ] . Therefore , Hsu cells were transfected with CxVago and the supernatant medium was collected 72 h post - transfection . Fresh Hsu cells were then transfected with the CxCul4 overexpression plasmid and , at 24 h post - transfection , the medium was replaced with medium containing CxVago to activate the Jak - STAT pathway . Real - time RT - qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 h after media replacement showed expression of CxVir1 was upregulated in control ( empty vector transfected ) cells but upregulation of CxVir1 was suppressed significantly in cells overexpressing CxCul4 ( Fig 4B ) . These results indicate that CxCul4 functions to inhibit the Jak - STAT pathway in Culex cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 49}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 166}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 585}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 701}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 729}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 938, "end": 945}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 986}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1061, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1303}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1445, "end": 1452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1534, "end": 1541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1594, "end": 1601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1603, "end": 1610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1642, "end": 1649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1674, "end": 1685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 198}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 626}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
