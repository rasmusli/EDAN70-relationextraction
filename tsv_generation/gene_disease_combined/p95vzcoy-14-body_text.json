For the cDNA synthesis , 5 \u00b5L 5 \u00d7 buffer , 1 . 125 \u00b5L nucleoside triphosphate ( dNTP ) 10 mM and 1 \u00b5L reverse transcriptase ( M - MLV ) was added to a final reaction volume of 25 \u00b5L , which was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 60 min . The resulting cDNA was diluted 1 / 5 and stored at \u2212 25 \u2022 C until further processing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
