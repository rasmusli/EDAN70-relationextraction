The nurses indicated that they feel vulnerable , since they are at great risk of contracting TB . The nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection , even when they are outside TB wards and that contributes to an outbreak of TB in rural areas . The findings of this study concur with those of the study done by Arjun [ 25 ] , which concluded that TB patients are a risk to community members because when they go to shopping centers and places where there are large numbers of people , such as social gatherings and church services they become a danger to the people .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 71}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 194}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 340}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 462}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
