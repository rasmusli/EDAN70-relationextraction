They decide to infect others or share their sputum just for them to get a TB grant . When they realize that they are recovering , they default for the social grant to continue . Most of those patients , when they come back to the hospitals , they will be MDR or XDR ; they do not survive . Some MDR or XDR TB patients infect one another in the TB ward . \" Nurse ( N6 ) had this to say : \" Patients also spread disease when they use public transport . They go to church and when they are in shopping complex . Each time I hear of TB outbreak in the communities I get stressed because I see large number of people who are still going to die of TB . We feel vulnerable because in the whole community we are the first people in the line of danger . \"", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 53}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 239}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 471}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 509}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 694}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 807}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
