We provide strong evidence of multiple outbreaks of FPL in three countries . There are no previous published reports of FPL outbreaks in any of these regions for comparison , although there is anecdotal first - hand experience of FPL among veterinarians practicing in Australia from the late 1960s to the mid - 1970s , before commercial vaccines were used routinely [ 1 ] . Despite the widespread circulation of CPV in Australia , this virus was not detected in any samples tested in these FPL outbreaks . Canine parvovirus causes approximately 5 % of FPL cases globally , but these have been confined to sporadic individual cases , and there are no reports of FPL outbreaks caused by CPV in multi - cat environments [ 8 , 15 , 16 ] . Whether this is due to viral or to host factors is currently unknown and warrants further investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 61}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 207}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 275}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 381, "end": 385}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 567}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 645}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 707}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 816}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 840}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
