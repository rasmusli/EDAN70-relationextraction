The files were subsequently submitted to an in - house Mascot server ( Matrix Science Ltd . , London , UK ) for database screening . The data were screened against the human sequence database [ National Center for Biotechnology Information non - redundant ( NCBInr ) ] . The search was performed using trypsin as a specific enzyme . A maximum of one missed cleavage was permitted and oxidation ( M ) , iTRAQ 4 plex ( K ) and iTRAQ 4 plex ( N - term ) were selected as variable modifications . The data obtained on the micrOTOF - Q were searched with a peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0 . 8 Da . Protein ratios were normalized using the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample for each separate ratio in every individual experiment . The ratio for a given protein was calculated by taking the average of all the peptide ratios that Briefly , the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies : Anti - apolipoprotein J precursor antibody ( ab16077 ; dilution , 1 : 2 , 000 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - hemoglobin \u03b2 ( sc - 21757 ; dilution , 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti - CRP precursor ( ab32412 ; dilution , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) , anti - platelet factor 4 precursor ( AB1488P ; dilution , 1 : 5 , 000 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) and anti - VN ( ab11591 ; dilution , 1 : 500 ; Abcam ) at 4 [UNK] C overnight . After washing , the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( ECL ; Forevergen , Guangzhou , China ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 406}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 534}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 545}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1187, "end": 1230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1294, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1411, "end": 1432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1434, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1469, "end": 1475}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1479, "end": 1514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1516, "end": 1524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1590, "end": 1600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1602, "end": 1610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1633, "end": 1639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1716, "end": 1773}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
