We used the average weighted - degree of the sampled nodes kw sampled l \u00bc 1 = N S P i [ S P j ( a ij \u00fe a ji ) to estimate the total weight of the original networkW original \u00bc kw sampled lN = 2 , and rescale the network as in equation ( 2 . 1 ) but using the estimate for the total weight of the original network . However , as shown in electronic supplementary material , figure S6 , these scaled networks result in significant overpredictions of epidemic size , particularly when small percentages of the nodes are sampled . For the remainder of this paper , we therefore use the unscaled versions of the node sampling methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
