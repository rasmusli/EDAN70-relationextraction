The offspring were perfused via the heart with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS . The brains were then fixed in 4 % PFA for at least 24 h , embedded in paraffin , and cut in coronal planes ( approximately 2 . 0 mm posterior to bregma ) . Immunofluorescence staining was performed using the following primary antibodies : rabbit monoclonal anti - Olig2 antibody ( ab109186 , 1 : 100 ; Abcam , Tokyo , Japan ) or rabbit polyclonal anti - GFAP antibody ( 23935 - 1 - AP , 1 : 100 ; Proteintech , Chicago , IL ) . The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0 C overnight and were further incubated with secondary antibodies ( Alexa fluor 488 , 1 : 500 or Alexa fluor 563 , 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) for 30 min at room temperature . Nissl staining was also performed in order to evaluate the number of neuronal cells . Following deparaffinization , the tissue sections were incubated in 0 . 2 % cresyl violet ( Muto Pure Chemicals Co . ) , and subsequently dehydrated in graded ethanol , and permanently mounted . Images were acquired with a BZ - 9000 microscope ( Keyence Corporation , Osaka , Japan ) . The BZ Image Measurement Software program ( Keyence ) was used to quantify the number of neuronal cells and Olig2 - positive cells , as well as the number and the soma size of the GFAP - positive cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 523}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 618}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 717}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
