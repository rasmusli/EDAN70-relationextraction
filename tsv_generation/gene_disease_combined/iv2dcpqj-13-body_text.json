Twenty - four hours after lentivirus - mediated shRNAs transduction , PK - 15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0 . 1 . The viral replication was analyzed by real - time RT - PCR , virus titration and Western blotting . In comparison with the shNC control , the viral genome copies in the eEF1A - knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A ) . Similarly , the CSFV titers were significantly increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK - 15 cells ( Figure 4B ) , and the N pro protein expression in the sheEF1A - transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ) . The results indicate that the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 118}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 604}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 631}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 651}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 854}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 982}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
