The SEED also offers an alternative for creating custom interfaces , moreover , one that does not require the user to know appropriate SEED IDs . This approach exploits the conversion capabilities of the SEED for creating a program to accept arbitrary protein IDs . It also exploits the ability of SEED to map functional roles into subsystems as described in the preceding example . The result is a tool that enables the user to take a SEED ID and a region size , and extract the genes that are found within a region centered on the designated gene .
