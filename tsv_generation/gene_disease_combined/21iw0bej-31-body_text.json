PAB was confirmed to promote G2 / M arrest after 24 h ( Figure 6C ) . To assess the effects of PAB on viral RNA and virulence , RD cells were infected with EV - D68 US / KY / 14 - 18953 strain or EV - A71 at an MOI of 0 . 8 for 2 h and then treated with 2 \u00b5M PAB for 24 h . PAB decreased the genomic RNA levels of both EV - D68 ( 28 . 32 % of control ; P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 6D ) and EV - A71 ( 59 . 87 % of control ; P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 6E ) . Furthermore , PAB decreased the TCID50 / ml value of both EV - D68 ( 80 . 31 % decrease ; P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 6F ) and EV - A71 ( 91 . 27 % decrease ; P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 6G ) . These results confirm that G2 / M arrest inhibits both the EV - D68 and EV - A71 strains , which suggest a common approach for therapeutic intervention that might potentially target a broader range of enteroviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 970, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
