In 2009 , the Limpopo Provincial TB Annual Report [ 6 ] stated that the number of TB cases in Vhembe district was 2194 . In 2012 , Vhembe district had the highest number of TB patients in the Limpopo Province [ 7 ] . Tshitangano et al . [ 8 ] , further indicated that TB infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of TB patients . Infection control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [ 8 ] . In line with this assertion , Gursimrat [ 9 ] argues that one of the major challenges to control TB infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure . In addition , shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of Multi - Drug Resistant TB ( MDR - TB ) and TB patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [ 10 ] . Healthcare - associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers . It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for tuberculosis patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district , Limpopo Province .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 282}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 377}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 498}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 706}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 841, "end": 867}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 878}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 884, "end": 887}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 1004}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
