{"cord_uid": "6i7b1i5x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6514959", "divid": "3", "text": "Kawasaki disease ( KD ) , also known as Kawasaki syndrome , is the leading cause of acquired cardiac disease in children [ 1 ] . Diagnosis is purely clinical , as there are no adequately specific or sensitive tests available . The ' classic ' diagnosis involves five days of fever and having four of the five following criteria : Mucous membrane inflammation , rash , hands and feet swelling , conjunctivitis , and a solitary inflamed lymph node mass [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . If left untreated , roughly one - quarter of the children meeting clinical criteria will go on to have coronary artery inflammation , including aneurysms . Incomplete cases , those which do not fulfill four of five of the classic criteria , have similar risk of coronary aneurysms [ 6 ] . Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) reduces the rates of coronary aneurysms , with a minority seemingly resistant to treatment [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . Although most aneurysms resolve , some defects are retained . Initial studies done on adults with a history of KD implies there is a greater lifetime risk of cardiac issues and early mortality [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . To add to the diagnostic confusion , several infectious etiologies have also been independently associated with aneurysms [ 15 ] . It remains a frustrating diagnosis because of the unknown etiology , clinical variability , lack of specific testing , and unclear pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 17}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 22}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 281}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 359}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 366}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 392}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 409}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 609}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 631}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 758}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 855, "end": 874}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 984, "end": 994}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1081, "end": 1084}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1305, "end": 1315}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
