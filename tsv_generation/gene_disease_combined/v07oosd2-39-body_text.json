However , Amezcua and collaborators [ 1 ] reported an important proportion of farms with PWD occurrence using high levels of ZnO . Also , several studies reported an increased proportion of E . coli isolates resistant to tetracycline and sulfonamides in pigs fed with high zinc doses [ 113 , 114 ] . This may explain why antimicrobial resistance persists even in the absence of antimicrobial exposure [ 115 , 116 ] . Moreover , the use of high zinc levels in pig feeds has led to heavy metal contamination in the soil , raising environmental concerns [ 115 ] . Recently , Bouwhuis et al . [ 117 ] reported that organic zinc [ zinc methionine ( ZnM ) ] could be used as a substitute for the inorganic zinc ( ZnO ) in the pig diet . In fact , organic zinc can be supplemented in lower doses ( up to 500 mg / kg feed ) compared to ZnO [ 117 ] . In this study , the inclusion of ZnM resulted in improved faecal scores and the intestinal architecture compared to that observed in pigs supplemented with ZnO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 168}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 342}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
