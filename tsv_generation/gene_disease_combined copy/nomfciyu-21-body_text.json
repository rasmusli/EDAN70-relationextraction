Currently , more than 140 peptide therapeutics are lined up for clinical evaluation presenting peptide research as a component of pharmaceutical research [ 80 ] . As compared with chemical drugs , peptide drugs show high specificity toward the target as well as little side effect and drug tolerance [ 19 ] . Many peptide therapeutics have shown positive results against viral infections , for instance RVFV - 6 peptide against rift valley fever virus and Kn2 - 7 peptide derived from scorpion venom against HIV - 1 [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] . Antimicrobial peptides are cited as potential novel antiviral therapeutics against coronaviruses [ 84 ] . Antimicrobial peptides are produced by host immune system upon initial exposure to pathogens . These are gene encoded and positively charged peptides that are selectively toxic against their targets [ 85 , 86 ] . This selectivity is due to their positive charge which attacks the negatively charged membrane bilayer of microbes [ 87 ] . The antimicrobial peptides block the receptors present on the host cell ' s surface , which in turn inhibit different steps of viral fusion and replication causing virolysis and activation of host ' s adaptive immune response [ 88 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1163}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 522}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 580}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 770}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
