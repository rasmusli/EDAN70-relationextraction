Echocardiography at 2 and 10 weeks after discharge were normal . A review of the investigation results from the regional laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of measles , with measles virus isolated from the patient ' s throat swab and measles - specific antibodies ( IgM ) present in the serum . Isolation of measles virus from the throat swab was performed using Vero / hSLAM cell lines . Typical cytopathic effect was observed as formation of syncytia , which appeared as large multinucleated cells ( giant cells ) . The cultures were then harvested and the presence of measles virus confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay ( Chemicon International , Temecula , USA ) . Measles - specific antibodies ( IgM ) in the serum were detected by an indirect enzyme linked immuno - sorbent assay ( ELISA ) using a commercially available test kit ( Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH , Marburg , Germany ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 349, "end": 353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 785}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 791}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 71}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 250}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 265}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 325}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 399}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 536}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
