This result indicates that chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone - bound . , 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 cells are expressed at lower working concentrations than we tested in our in vitro analysis shown in Figure 6 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 16}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 344}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 474}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
