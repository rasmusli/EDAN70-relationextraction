Many genes are modulated ( expressed or repressed ) during the course of infection and identification of mRNA and noncoding RNAs can be used to identify the mechanisms that control , or fail to control , disease . Moreover , some infectious diseases , including hantavirus disease , have substantial immunopathologic components . The quantitative assessment of the transcriptional landscape ( patterns of gene expression ) can be used to profile the host responses in infected and uninfected animals of the same species , or a disease model species to reservoir host species to identify mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance . RNA - Seq is one such method for profiling transcriptional landscapes [ 89 ] . The depth of coverage and costs of RNA - Seq have improved dramatically in the last few years , and it is likely to become less expensive . However , the computational resources necessary for using RNA - Seq for studying host responses is substantial , often requiring hundreds of gigabytes of RAM and multicore , multiprocessor systems typically found in servers running a Linux operating system [ 90 ] . This depth is often necessary to detect RNAs that occur in extremely low abundance because their proteins are highly potent ( e . g . , cytokines ) . Even then , it is possible that differentially expressed genes may not be detected and other , more sensitive methods , such as real - time PCR , may be required to validate pathway signatures . Despite these requirements , bioinformatics tools for RNA - Seq are now widely available , many of which are free . A typical first step of differential gene expression profiling is the de novo assembly of all RNA - Seq samples from an experiment , which represents the totality of expressed genes from the experiment . There are several de novo assemblers available , including the Trinity suite [ 90 ] and Oases [ 91 ] . Each of these packages has advantages and disadvantages , thus it is important to understand how each performs assemblies , particularly isoforms that may have specific activities . Included in the Trinity package is RSEM [ 92 ] that estimates transcript abundances , including isoforms , in experimental samples by counting reads from replicates against the de novo assembly . An important feature of RSEM is that it does not require an annotated genome ; it determines the abundance of transcripts from the unannotated assembly , identifies differentially expressed transcripts , and provides a 95 % credibility interval for each gene . Additional tools , such as DESeq and edgeR [ 93 , 94 ] provide statistical evaluation of differential gene expression between samples and provide quantitative ( higher / lower ) and qualitative ( on / off ) data . The differentially expressed transcripts are subsequently identified by other means ( e . g . , BLAST ) and can then be mapped to pathways ( such as Reactome or KEGG ) [ 95 , 96 ] to visualize [ 97 ] where viruses may influence the host response and identify mechanistic targets of hantaviruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 863}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1026}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1264, "end": 1269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1360, "end": 1370}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1623, "end": 1633}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1779, "end": 1789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 2209, "end": 2214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 2394, "end": 2399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2430, "end": 2447}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 357}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 388}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
