{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "8", "text": "In order to test whether ORF2 or ORF3 protein of HEV inhibit cellular NF - \u03baB activity , a reporter vector with IL - 2 receptor promoter region , which contains NF - \u03baB element , cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence ( NF - \u03baB CAT ; [ 10 ] was used . This vector was inducible by NF - \u03baB activating agents like TPA or IL - 1\u03b2 . Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF - \u03baB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids . Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF - \u03baB CAT activity ( Figure 1A ) . However , no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression ( Figure 1A ) . In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF - \u03baB activity was an artifact of the experimental system , cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( TPA ) , a known inducer of NF - \u03baB activity [ 11 ] , or transfected with an expression construct of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 , which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF - \u03baB activity [ 12 ] . TPA treatment increased NF - \u03baB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF - \u03baB activity ( Figure 1A ) . Similarly , co - expression of ORF2 in IKK\u03b2 transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF - \u03baB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 1B ) . These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF - \u03baB activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 30}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 529}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 535}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 690, "end": 695}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 790}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 948, "end": 956}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1034}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1184, "end": 1192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1323, "end": 1331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1387, "end": 1392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1448, "end": 1456}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1510, "end": 1515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1570, "end": 1575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1584, "end": 1592}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
