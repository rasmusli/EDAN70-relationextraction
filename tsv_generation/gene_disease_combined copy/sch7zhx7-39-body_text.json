Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular protease activity and , as a result , leaf senescence [ 41 ] . The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells , though . For instance , spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [ 32 , 33 ] . Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of proteases , especially viral proteases , has not been fully explored ; however , our work suggests that viral proteases may be modulated by polyamines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 60}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 175}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 523}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 552}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 633}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
