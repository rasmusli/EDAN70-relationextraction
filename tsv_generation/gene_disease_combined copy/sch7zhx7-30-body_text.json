{"cord_uid": "sch7zhx7", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6563312", "divid": "30", "text": "The reduction in eIF4G cleavage by viral protease in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral protease activity , or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication , protease translation , and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity . To directly measure viral protease activity in cells , we generated a protease - sensitive dual luciferase reporter system . In this split luciferase system , cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity , which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control . This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion . To generate this system , we cloned a 2A target sequence - MTNTGAFG - and a 3C target sequence - AMEQG - into the firefly luciferase reporter [ 37 ] . We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression . These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO . Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity . We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ) , protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 \u00b5M . These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 391}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 894}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 902}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 941}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 975}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 984, "end": 997}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1277, "end": 1280}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1513, "end": 1522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1603, "end": 1612}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
