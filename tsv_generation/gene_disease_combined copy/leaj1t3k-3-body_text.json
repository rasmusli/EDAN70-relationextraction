Along with the emergence of newly - recognized human pathogens ( the SARS coronavirus , the recent influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 ) , the ever - increasing incidence of chronic viral infections caused by HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses continues to increase OPEN ACCESS the global burden of infectious diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . Vaccines have been developed for some of the most important viral pathogens .
