Despite the fact that the viral line has been attributed to reassortment with swine viruses , with partial contribution from earlier reassortments between swine and avian strains [ 8 ] , it does not display a jump in mutation count . Reassortment can produce novel antigenic variants , but it does not reverse the majority of mutations , for they have accumulated in the non - reassorted areas of the genome .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 129}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
