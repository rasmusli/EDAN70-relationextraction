The increased T cell effector cell phenotype indeed correlated with elevated levels of mRNA for T cell derived pro - inflammatory cytokines IFN - \u03b3 and IL - 2 ( Figure 2D ) . Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection , the presence of JHMV within CNS - draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low levels of mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid ( N ) protein in control DTR \u2212 mice ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , increased T cell activation correlated with a reduction of viral N mRNA to below detection within CLN of DTR + mice at day 28 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . Since IFN - \u03b3 has antiviral activity ( 31 , 32 ) , elevated IFN - \u03b3 as a result of increased antiviral T cell activity in the absence of Treg is consistent with a decline in viral RNA .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 590}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 636}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 852}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 898, "end": 906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 980}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1012, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 500}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
