When walking through the aisle during the coughing of the index patient , the moving person may receive an intake fraction of 2 . 2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 6 , which is larger than that of 80 % of the seated passengers . Especially , for the passengers who are seated far away from the index patient , the intake fractions that they received during walking in the airplane cabin can be O ( 10 2 ) larger than that without movement . If a seated passenger walks in the airplane and passes through the high - dose region close to the index patient , he / she may also receive a significantly high intake dose . Frequent walking of the seated passengers may also result in a high infection risk , which may be up to 55 % . After considering the movement behaviors of the seated passengers in the risk assessment and likelihood analysis , a much higher likelihood is estimated . So the walking activities of the seated passengers may be another explanation of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient . This result indicates that the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin . Taking the influence of human movement into consideration is still necessary and important for the infection control in enclosed environment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
