Viruses interact with bacteria and the host at various stages along the pathologic pathway to promote bacterial pneumonia ( Table 3 ) . For example , virus can increase shedding of URT bacteria into the LRT : in vitro biofilm and murine studies suggest influenza A virus infection can lead to the dispersion of S . pneumoniae biofilms , releasing virulent pneumococci for subsequent secondary infections in the LRT [ 88 , 89 ] . When in a biofilm , S . pneumoniae is less virulent ; capsule polysaccharide and pneumolysin production are reduced and synthesis of the bacterial adhesin phosphorylcholine increased [ 90 , 91 ] . Viral infections also can promote bacterial adhesion to host cells [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] . Influenza and PIV promote bacterial adhesion with respiratory epithelium cells by cleaving sialic acid and exposing receptors on host cell oligosaccharide chains [ 95 , 96 ] . In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest free sialic acid released by viral neuraminidase can behave as signaling molecules promoting pneumococcal biofilm formation , nasopharyngeal colonization and bacterial spread to the lungs [ 97 ] . Free sialic acid is believed to play a role in invasion by nontypeable H . influenza as it is an important component of the biofilm matrix and incorporated into the bacterial capsular polysaccharide to evade host defense mechanisms [ 98 ] . Although literature is scarce , the relationship may be bilateral as bacterial neuraminidase can promote virus survival during treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors [ 99 ] . In addition , viruses can promote bacterial adhesion by upregulating cell surface receptors for pathogenic bacteria . For example , RSV and PIV - 3 infection can lead to upregulation of receptors intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , carcinoembryonic antigen - related cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CEACAM1 ) , and platelet - activating factor receptor ( PAF - r ) to promote binding of nontypeable H . influenzae and S . pneumonia to epithelial cells [ 100 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1185}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1609, "end": 1633}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1682, "end": 1696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1785, "end": 1808}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1912, "end": 1946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1948, "end": 1957}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1961, "end": 2021}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 2023, "end": 2031}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 2039, "end": 2077}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2079, "end": 2087}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 291}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 440}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
