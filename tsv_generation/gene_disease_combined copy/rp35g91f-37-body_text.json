Similarly , analyses with the WikiPathway tool demonstrated enrichment for \" striated muscle contraction \" and \" calcium regulation in the cardiac cell \" ( Table 5 ) . In agreement with the GO and pathway results , the pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was enriched with higher order muscle phenotypes such as \" abnormal cardiac muscle contractility , \" \" abnormal cardiac tissue morphology , \" and \" abnormal heart size \" ( Figure 3 ) . Enrichment for pathways related to both abnormal contractility and calcium signaling / regulation led us to investigate the ion channels and regulatory proteins expressed in the extended gene network .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 833}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 857}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 153}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 187}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 608}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 679}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
