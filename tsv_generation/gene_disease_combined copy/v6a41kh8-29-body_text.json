The epidemic lasted from July 2004 to January 2005 and comprised 70 % of the hMPV isolates detected during the entire 3year study period . Substantial variation in the yearly incidence of hMPV has also been reported earlier [ 43 , 44 ] . Epidemics with this virus have been reported to occur during late winter to spring in temperate climates [ 33 , 45 ] , including North India [ 46 ] , where the majority of hMPV were detected from December to February , and Korea [ 45 ] , where hMPV peaked between February and April . A study in subtropical Hong Kong found hMPV infections mainly in the spring and summer months [ 47 ] , similar to that of RSV [ 48 ] and occasionally influenza [ 49 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 30}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 177}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 288}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 577, "end": 582}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 744}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 778}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
