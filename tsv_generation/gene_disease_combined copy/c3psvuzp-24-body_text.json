For instance , PARP4 is a component of large cytoplasmic structures known as vaults , whose functions are poorly understood . Although vaults are extremely ancient , dating back to the origin of eukaryotes , they have been lost in multiple lineages [ 9 ] , suggesting that they are not universally necessary to perform an essential , housekeeping function . Instead , there are several tantalizing pieces of evidence that vaults may be involved in immunity . These include an increased number of vaults in immune cell types , IFN - upregulation of MVP , the major component of vaults , and upregulation of noncoding vault RNAs ( vRNAs ) on infection with pathogens such as Epstein - Barr virus [ 45 ] . PARP4 itself is present at , 10 molecules per vault , but its functional role there is unknown [ 44 ] . However , our observation that the positively selected residues we find in PARP4 are localized to a single disordered region in PARP4 suggests a model for its role in vault - mediated immunity . Such a localized pattern of positively selected sites is reminiscent of two well - characterized rapidly evolving antiviral factors , TRIM5a and MxA , shown to be on the ' offensive ' ( i . e . directly binding to viral proteins ) side of the host - virus conflict [ 34 ] . TRIM5a and MxA both use their rapidly evolving regions , also in the context of multimeric complexes , to directly recognize and target viral proteins , lentiviral capsids in the case of TRIM5a and orthomyxovirus nucleoproteins in the case of MxA [ 35 , 36 ] . Thus , we infer that the positively selected region of PARP4 ( exon 30 in humans ) has evolved to maintain recognition of a factor encoded by pathogens that can infect many diverse mammalian lineages , or is a common means to counteract independent unrelated pathogens . This interaction may be used to directly ADPribosylate viral components , which could affect their activity and impede infection . Alternatively , independent of ADP - ribosylation , PARP4 interaction may recruit viral proteins to the vault structures within virally infected cells , wherein the vault proteins might sequester viral proteins and thereby impede their infectivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 63}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 71}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 91}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 195}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 704}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 726}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 877, "end": 883}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1290, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1310, "end": 1317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1321, "end": 1325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1390, "end": 1405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1450, "end": 1457}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1461, "end": 1465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1530, "end": 1551}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1586, "end": 1601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1603, "end": 1622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1637, "end": 1644}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1648, "end": 1678}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1693, "end": 1697}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1766, "end": 1772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1774, "end": 1782}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 2037, "end": 2054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2165, "end": 2171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2195, "end": 2210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 868}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
