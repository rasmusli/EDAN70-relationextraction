JX869059 ) . A cDNA fragment was generated by DNA synthesis ( Invitrogen Life Technology , Regensburg , Germany ) and cloned into the MVA transfer plasmid pIIIH5red [ 45 ] to place the MERS - CoV N gene sequence under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early / late promoter PmH5 [ 46 ] resulting in the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red - MERS - N .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 9}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 95}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 309}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 593}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 671, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 740}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
