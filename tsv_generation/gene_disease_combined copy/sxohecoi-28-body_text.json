One of these studies found that polyclonal anti - HIV Env IgG inhibited transcytosis of cell - free virus on HEC - 1 cells , whereas none of 13 mAbs did ; in fact , some of the mAbs might have increased transcytosis , although by no more than about 50 % [ 61 ] . To our knowledge , none of these studies was carried out under the acidic conditions that characterize female genital tract secretions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 291}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
