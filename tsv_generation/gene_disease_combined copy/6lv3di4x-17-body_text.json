{"cord_uid": "6lv3di4x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6258954", "divid": "17", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction , there is increasing evidence for vector - free transmission of flaviviruses , in which oronasal , contact , or aerosol exposure to the virus has resulted in infection of various vertebrates . The reported flaviviruses , all described as mosquito borne , include at least JEV , WNV , SLEV , yellow fever virus , ZIKV , Spondweni virus , WESSV , TMUV , and dengue virus ( DENV ) , and the species concerned include pigs , humans , nonhuman primates , mice , guinea pigs , hamsters , geese , partridges , ducks , several other species of birds , and even alligators ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 - 17 , 20 - 22 , 24 - 27 , 46 - 54 ) . Some of these reports are from experimental studies , and others are from field observations , laboratory infections , or infections of exposed health care providers or animal caretakers . Despite this multitude of reports , nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission . For nonlaboratory exposures , a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine . In fact , this has been described in many of the references previously cited , but the source of virus and first target remained unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 111}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 253}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 310}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 316}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 323}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 351}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 369}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 377}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 384}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 403}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 410}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
