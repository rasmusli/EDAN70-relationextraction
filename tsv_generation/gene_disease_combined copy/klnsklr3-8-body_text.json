{"cord_uid": "klnsklr3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2699471", "divid": "8", "text": "The rapid systemic appearance of CD69 expression suggested that a soluble factor such as IFNa , a known early responder to viral infections [ 22 ] and strong trigger of CD69 expression [ 17 , 19 , 20 ] , was inducing the response . To determine whether the LDV - induced IFNa response [ 16 ] could be responsible for CD69 induction , we first utilized the fact that IFNa induces CD69 expression on B cells in vitro [ 19 ] . Splenic B cells were isolated from na\u00efve mice using CD19 + magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and cultured with 10 % plasma taken from mice infected 16 hours earlier with LDV . B cells cultured for 4 hours with plasma from infected , but not uninfected mice , significantly upregulated CD69 expression ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , upregulation of CD69 expression was prevented by addition of a neutralizing antibody specific for IFNa ( PBL Interferon Source ) in a concentrationdependent manner . These findings suggested that the IFNa response to LDV infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 276}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 322}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 715}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 776}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 858}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 860, "end": 882}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 960}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 599}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 976}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
