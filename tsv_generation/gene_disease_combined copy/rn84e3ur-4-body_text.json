Almost 4 million deaths due to respiratory infections diseases and 1 . 5 million deaths due to tuberculosis are reported every year [ 2 ] . In the past four decades , airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases within enclosed environment has been widely reported by many epidemiology reports [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . In an airplane cabin , the airflow from front to back of the cabin ( longitudinal ) is minimal due to the ventilation system , which means in - flight transmission of disease contaminants should be confined within two rows of an infected passenger [ 6 , 7 ] . One possible cause of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient might be the movements of the walking crew members or passengers along the aisle in the airplane cabin [ 8 ] . The walking persons might also get infected when they move close to the infector [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 43}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 211}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 327}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
