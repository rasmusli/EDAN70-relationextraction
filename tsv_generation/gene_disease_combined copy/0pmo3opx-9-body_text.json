In particular , these features include , among others , a significant preference for certain hydrophobic residues ( such as tryptophan , phenylalanine , and proline ) at the P4 \u2032 position , a preference for serine / threonine or phenylalanine at the P2 \u2032 and P3 \u2032 positions , and a decreased preference for proline at the P1 \u2032 position ( Fig . 1A , B , and Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Structural basis for APN P1 substrate specificity . To provide a molecular basis for APN substrate recognition and catalysis , crystal structures were solved of APN bound to natural free amino acids with varied P1 preferences ( methionine , leucine , arginine , glycine , isoleucine , and aspartic acid ) to probe the influences of the extended binding pocket . Due to the nearly identical architecture of the active sites and P1 specificities of pAPN and hAPN , pAPN was used for analysis because of its propensity to form high quality crystals 5 , 6 . The crystal structure of pAPN in complex with the free amino acid alanine and a seven amino acid poly - alanine peptide substrate were initially determined ( Figure 2 ) . The seahorse - shaped ectodomain of pAPN contains 4 domains , head , side , body , and tail ( Fig . 2A ) . The N - terminal residue of peptide substrates is firmly anchored in the spacious active site of APN between the head and body domains with residues Gln208 , Glu350 and Glu406 forming hydrogen bonds with the free N - terminal amine group ( Fig . 2B , C ) . The nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond forms a hydrogen bond with the electron - repelling carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 , while the carbonyl oxygen of the scissile peptide bond interacts with the electron - attracting zinc and Tyr472 ( Fig . 2B , C ) . The resonating electrons of the scissile peptide bond are pulled towards the carbonyl oxygen , thus , destabilizing the bond and making it available to nucleophilic attack by the zinc - activated water molecule . At the same time , the activated nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond is also ready to accept a proton from the catalytic water through the side chain of Glu384 . In the presence of free alanine , the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from pAPN maintains a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of the free alanine , suggesting that the carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine near Ala348 is protonated . Protonation of this carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine is due to simultaneous deprotonation of the other carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine by zinc and Tyr472 ( Fig . 2D , E ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 100}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 458}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 462, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 614}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 671, "end": 675}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 747, "end": 751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 931, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1038}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1047}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1315, "end": 1344}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1491, "end": 1512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1515, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1553}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
