Birds started showing signs of the disease on day 3 pi and gradually recovered by day 6 - 7 pi . To compare egg production between groups on a weekly basis , daily values were averaged ( Figure 1 ) and are here expressed as laying rates ( % ) , considering a production of 10 eggs / 10 hens / day as a hypothetical value of 100 % . Before the infection , all of the layers in the H9 and K groups laid eggs scoring a mean production of 93 . 0 % and 95 . 0 % , respectively and we did not observe any statistical difference between the two groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 200}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
