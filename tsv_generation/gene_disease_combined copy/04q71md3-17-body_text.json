The model tracks the number of susceptible ( S ) , infected ( I ) and recovered ( R ) individuals in each population each day of the simulation . The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [ 31 ] . Infection spreads through mass - action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters . Population - specific host population size is equal to human population size ( Text S1 ) . Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1 : the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [ 31 ] and the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1 . 3 [ 31 ] . This results in a transmission rate b ~ 0 : 433 . Although estimates of R 0 for pandemic H1N1 vary across studies , the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations . Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j ~ P n i ~ 1 r ij bI i S j = N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within - population contacts and r jj ~ 1 . Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates , so that r ij ~ c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data . Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations ( see below ) . This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model , despite their different scales . Compartments are updated according to a t - leaping algorithm [ 32 ] with one - day intervals .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1167, "end": 1181}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
