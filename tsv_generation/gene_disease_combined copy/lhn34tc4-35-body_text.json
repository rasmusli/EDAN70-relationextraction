The present findings indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine in the context of an infectious disease outbreak and for serious sanctions against those who fail to comply . Our data further suggest , however , that public support for quarantine is contingent on the implementation both of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and of psychosocial supports to provide for individuals who are adversely affected . This tension between individual rights and the greater public good is precisely the challenge that infectious disease presents to public health ethics . In order to engender strong public support for the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures , government officials and public health policy - makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards , to educate and inform frontline public health workers , and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during infectious disease outbreaks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 201}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 644}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
