{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "5", "text": "One function of ADP - ribosylation may be to regulate viral infectivity and pathogenesis , consistent with the role of other PTMs in immunity . For example , both vaccinia virus [ 17 ] and herpes simplex virus [ 18 ] require ADP - ribosylation activity for viral replication . Moreover , diverse RNA viruses , such as alphaviruses , hepatitis E virus , rubella virus and SARS coronavirus encode one or more macrodomains , potentially conferring the ability to specifically recognize , and possibly reverse , ADPribosylation upon these viruses [ 19 ] . Mutations in the macrodomain of Sindbis virus led to reduced virulence in mice [ 20 ] . Similarly , mutations in the SARS coronavirus macrodomain sensitized the virus to the antiviral effects of the signaling cytokine , interferon ( IFN ) [ 21 ] . As IFN functions as one of the primary mediators of the innate immune system against viruses [ 22 ] , these results indicate that macrodomains , and therefore ADP - ribosylation , could be important viral regulators of host immunity . Moreover , host PARP genes can play a direct role in antiviral immunity . For example , overexpression of PARP13 , also known as ZAP or ZC3HAV1 ( Zinc - finger CCCH - type antiviral protein 1 ) , is sufficient to restrict replication of several different families of viruses , including a retrovirus ( murine leukemia virus [ 23 ] ) , filoviruses ( Ebola and Marburg [ 24 ] ) , a togavirus ( Sindbis [ 25 ] ) and a hepadnavirus ( Hepatitis B virus [ 26 ] ) . This antiviral activity is mediated through direct binding of viral RNA by PARP13 , followed by recruitment of the exosome and specific degradation of viral RNA [ 27 , 28 ] , although more recently , additional signaling roles for PARP13 have been proposed [ 14 , 29 ] . Beyond the welldescribed PARP13 - mediated antiviral functions , PARP1 , 7 , 10 and 12 have been shown to play roles in repressing viral replication [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , although the mechanisms of these antiviral actions are unknown . While these results indicate that there may be a role for individual PARPs in regulating viral infectivity or pathogenesis , there has been no cohesive model for how ADP - ribosylation may influence host - viral interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 751, "end": 770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 783}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 807}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1141, "end": 1148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1164, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1171, "end": 1179}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1181, "end": 1227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1569, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1645, "end": 1655}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1725, "end": 1732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1790, "end": 1797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1830, "end": 1836}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 210}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 351}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 367}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 388}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 1324, "end": 1335}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1359}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 1370, "end": 1382}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 1415, "end": 1425}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 1450, "end": 1463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1483}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
