The reason for choosing a protein - based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene - based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts . To perform this study , three protein data sets have been collected as follows .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 148}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
