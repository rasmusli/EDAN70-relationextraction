We then evaluated whether IRF3 activation would be affected by the expression of M protein . IRF3 dimerization visualized by non - denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct IRF3 activation . 39 Therefore , we ectopically expressed IRF3 and M protein with the inducer RIG - I N in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for IRF3 dimerization . When the inducer RIG - I N was exclusively co - expressed with IRF3 , the detection of an additional slow - migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of IRF3 , which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator ( Figure 4C ; lane 2 compared with lane 1 ) . Interestingly , when M protein was expressed , the signal reflecting the dimeric form of IRF3 molecules was significantly diminished , even though the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS - PAGE ( Figure 4C ; lower panel for SDS - PAGE ) , suggesting that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS - CoV M protein . IRF3 phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of MERS M protein in a similar experimental setup ( Figure 4D ; lane 3 compared with lane 2 ) . Together with other results , MERS - CoV M protein was thought to interact with TRAF3 to perturb TRAF3 - TBK1 interaction , which , in turn , affects IRF3 phosphorylation and activation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 224}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 434}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 521}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 604}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 866, "end": 876}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 934, "end": 949}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1171, "end": 1176}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1216, "end": 1237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1303, "end": 1318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1426, "end": 1447}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1476, "end": 1482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1499, "end": 1506}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1546, "end": 1551}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
