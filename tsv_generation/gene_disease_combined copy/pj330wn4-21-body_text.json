We have used the ciliaFA software to examine AVI files of different lengths , captured at different frame rates ( data not shown ) . We found that videos captured using high - speed video cameras that capture at rates at least 120 frames per second with a length of 128 frames ( to give a frequency resolution of 0 . 94 ) will give valid data . These settings capture an appropriate number of ciliary beat cycles to accurately average the CBF ; the lower the frequency resolution ( that is , the more frames captured ) , the greater the accuracy of CBF . To allow the videos to be used for beat pattern analysis high - speed video cameras that capture at rates exceeding 250 frames per second should be used . The ciliaFA software has the capability to crop frames from large files to speed up the calculation of frequency without reducing the frequency resolution . For high - frequency analysis , we recommend that the microscope bulb is connected to a stable power source of at least 110 volt AC / 60 Hz ; lower voltages may cause the bulb to flicker within the CBF range and this will enhance background noise . We also recommend that the image is not subject to downstream processing , such as enhanced pixel gain , as this will also enhance background noise .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 160}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 554}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 664}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 833}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1180}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
