Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and human herpes virus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation . They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [ 27 , 28 ] . Recently , a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients ( donor or recipient CMV seropositive ) transplanted for HCV was performed to evaluate the associations of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT . It was found that CMV infection was associated with increased risk of fibrosis stage [UNK] 2 and inflammation grade [UNK] 2 [ 29 ] . However , their effects on posttransplant HCV recurrence still remain questionable . Data showed that short - term CMV viremia does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [ 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 503}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 563}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 602}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 635}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 723}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 792}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 873}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
