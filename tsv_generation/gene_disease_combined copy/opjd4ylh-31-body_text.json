We only get 21 masks per week , to share with social workers , doctors and other staff that come to the TB wards . We do not get enough gloves , and we do not have aprons . We sometimes lack soap to wash our hands after coming into contact with TB patients , and we also have limited washing basins . In addition , the windows are too small and there is poor airflow in the wards . UV lights are not regularly service . \" Nurse ( N1 ) added that : \" This whole thing ( emotional ) of us being given fake masks results in negative practice for patient - care since we are afraid to contract TB . Each time we look at the patients we get scared of being in the same situation , hmmm , there are more negative thoughts in TB wards than positive ones . \"", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 211}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 349, "end": 352}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 826}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
