{"cord_uid": "i8cgsd4x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4556628", "divid": "15", "text": "To further confirm that CxCul4 is a negative regulator of Jak - STAT pathway , Hsu cells were transfected with a plasmid ( p6x2DRAF - Luc ) containing a Firefly luciferase reporter gene under Drosophila STAT - responsive elements , along with dsRNA against CxCul4 . After 24 h , cells were infected with WNV and luciferase activity was measured 16 hpi . The results showed that CxCul4 knockdown resulted in increased luciferase activity in WNV - infected cells using anti - WNV NS5 and anti - \u03b2 - actin antibodies conducted on lysates collected from cells treated as in B . Molecular weight markers represented as kDa . The band at around 95 kDa is expected size of WNV - NS5 ; while band at 191 kDa is non - specific . E . Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as a transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi . Total RNA was collected from cells and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and Cul4 - transfected cells ) . F . Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in E . G . Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid . Empty vector ( Empty ) was used as a transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi . Western blot was performed using anti - V5 ( detecting CxCul4 overexpression ) and anti - \u03b2 - actin antibodies . Molecular weight markers represented as kDa . Culex cullin ( Cul4 ) blocks the Jak - STAT pathway . A . Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin ( CxCul4 ) . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 - specific and Culex Vago - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0 . 05 , comparing between control and Cul4 - overexpressing cells ) . B . Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin ( CxCul4 ) . Empty vector ( Control ) was used as transfection control . At 24 h post - transfection , the cells were treated with CxVago - containing medium and total RNA was collected 48 h later . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 - specific primers . RpL32 primers were used as an internal control . Error bars represent standard error from three ( Fig 4C ) . As a positive control , cells were stimulated with heat - inactivated E . coli for 1 h , which also showed increased luciferase activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 138}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 264}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 599}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 618}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 790}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 805}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1050}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1071, "end": 1077}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1475, "end": 1509}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1511, "end": 1524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1526, "end": 1532}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1711, "end": 1721}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1733, "end": 1740}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1761, "end": 1789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1791, "end": 1816}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1837, "end": 1850}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1852, "end": 1857}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1870, "end": 1881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 32, "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 917}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 33, "span": {"begin": 1630, "end": 1634}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
