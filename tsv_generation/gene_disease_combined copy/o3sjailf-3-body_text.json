{"cord_uid": "o3sjailf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4972905", "divid": "3", "text": "Each specimen in pool 1 ( patients T32 , T794 , T359 , T560 and T524 ) was analyzed individually using the astrovirus VA1 - specific real - time reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) targeting the capsid region ( forward primer 5 \u2032 - CCA TCA GCA GTT ACY GGG TCT GT - 3 \u2032 ; reverse primer 5 \u2032 - CGT GGC TCC AGG TGA YTG T - 3 \u2032 ; probe 5 \u2032 - FAM - TTT CCG CAT ATC CC - MGB _ NFQ - 3 \u2032 ) under the following cycling conditions : 50 \u00b0 C for 30 min ; 95 \u00b0 C for 15 min ; 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 \u00b0 C and 1 min at 55 \u00b0 C . Patient T359 was confirmed positive for astrovirus VA1 ( Ct value = 29 . 6 ; Figure 1 ) . The initial T359 nasopharyngeal specimen was reanalyzed individually by NGS . NGS data were analyzed with ezVIR and completed by performing a de novo analysis . As shown in the ezVIR phase 2 report , 91 . 5 % coverage of the astrovirus VA1 genome was obtained ( 305 mapped reads ) , with a maximum coverage depth of 11 - fold . Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid fragment consensus sequence ( 1077 nucleotides long ) obtained from de novo assembly 5 shows the closest nucleotide homology ( 97 . 8 % ; Figure 1 ) with the novel human astrovirus ( HAstV ) VA1 / HMO - C - UK1 sequence ( KM358468 , corresponding to nucleotides 5137 \u2212 6213 ) . The presence of a parainfluenza virus type 4 ( PIV - 4 ) was also detected in the ezVIR phase 2 report , with lower signals for both parameters ( 174 mapped reads , 38 . 5 % genome coverage , maximum coverage depth of sevenfold ) . However , using the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 commercial assay ( Fast - track Diagnostics , Sliema , Malta ) , the PIV - 4 genome was not detected in the specimen , suggesting a viral load below the limit of detection of this assay ( the limit of positivity was Ct values \u2a7d 37 ) . By contrast , in agreement with the ezVIR phase 2 report for pool 1 ( Figure 1 ) , patients T32 and T794 were confirmed positive for PIV - 2 ( Ct value = 21 . 6 ) and PIV - 4 ( Ct value = 31 ) , respectively , by specific real - time RT - PCR . This finding suggests that the PIV - 4 - negative result in patient T359 reflects a very low viral load rather than potential mismatches between the assay target and the viral genome sequences of some PIV - 4 circulating in this specific area during the study . For this reason , PIV - 4 is considered unlikely to be responsible for the respiratory symptoms in this patient . Furthermore , an intrinsic consequence of highly sensitive NGS technology is the increased detection of interspecimen contamination . Therefore , the presence of several thousands of PIV - 4 mapped reads in pool 1 and pools 4 , 5 and 6 allows the possibility of potential contamination from neighboring PIV - 4 - positive samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 581, "end": 596}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 878}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 1023}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1215}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1217, "end": 1226}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1623, "end": 1638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1770, "end": 1773}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1291, "end": 1318}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
