{"cord_uid": "0hbeso65", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3655463", "divid": "20", "text": "Owing to relatively poor efficacy and high adverse effect , most experts now delay antiviral therapy till a histological evidence of recurrent HCV infection is established after LT . However , for patients diagnosed with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis , antiviral therapy must be given as early as possible after LT because of the poor short - term prognosis and rapid fibrosis progression . Initially , conventional IFN - based therapy was used to treat recurrent HCV infection after LT . A systematic review , consisted of 27 studies with a total of 689 patients , demonstrated a mean SVR rate of 24 % with conventional IFN - based therapy [ 70 ] . Compared to conventional IFN - based therapy , pegylated IFNbased therapy showed a significant improvement of SVR rate . Three recent systematic reviews demonstrated 20 - 40 % of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50 - 100 % in genotype 2 / 3 subjects using Pegylated IFN - based therapy for recurrent hepatitis C after LT [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] . The same result is also found in the histological improvement , regardless of necroinflammation or fibrosis . The factors to predict a better SVR are also the same as in nontransplant patients . Genotype non - 1 , low pretreatment HCV RNA , rapid virological response , and adherence to therapy have been identified as the positive predictors [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] . The association between response and recipient / donor liver IL - 28B genotype is also reported recently [ 26 , 74 ] . Charlton [ 26 ] . Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is another poor predictor , and it is almost incurable with IFN treatment when fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops [ 75 ] . Safety and tolerance for therapy are also among the major concern in LT recipients with HCV recurrence . Dose reduction , discontinuation , and acute rejection were noted in 44 % ( 38 - 50 % ) , 24 % ( 21 - 27 % ) , and 2 % ( 1 - 3 % ) of patients treated with conventional IFNbased therapy [ 70 ] . For the patients treated with Pegylated IFN therapy , a better SVR rate was noted in comparison to the IFN - based group . Meanwhile , the rejection rate was also found to be elevated with a mean rate of 5 - 10 % ( highest 25 % ) . In addition , dose reduction was noted in over 50 % of patients , and treatment discontinuation was found in around 30 % of patients [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 627}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 912, "end": 916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1435}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1585, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1928, "end": 1937}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1994, "end": 1998}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 157}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 253}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 379}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 480}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 946, "end": 958}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1089, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1493, "end": 1525}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1604, "end": 1636}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1723, "end": 1726}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1742, "end": 1746}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
