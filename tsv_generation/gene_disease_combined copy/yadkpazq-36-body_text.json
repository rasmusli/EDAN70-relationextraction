Just as stimulated PBMCs exhibited high mRNA expression of type I IFN and only a marginal increase in mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL - 6 and TNF\u03b1 , treated cats showed significantly increased Mx expression in their blood and lacked flu - like symptoms generally linked with administration of immunostimulatory molecules in vivo . Additionally , although our in vivo studies included a limited number of cats , the strength of responses to ODN 2216 stimulation in vitro and in vivo for individual animals strongly correlated , indicating that individual sensitivity to stimulation most likely can be predicted with in vitro experiments . Our data further show that a single subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 sufficed to induce the systemic presence of antiviral molecules for 24 to 36 h in the plasma of treated cats ; during this time , an increase of Mx expression of at least 4 - fold in the blood of treated cats was indicative of significant inhibition of viral replication in vitro . These observations support possible resistance to viral infection by ODN 2216 for several days , a phenomenon described already in mouse models [ 89 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 398}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 975}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1059}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 455}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1243, "end": 1259}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
