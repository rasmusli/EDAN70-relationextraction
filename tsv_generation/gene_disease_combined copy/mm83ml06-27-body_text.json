To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) and syngag expression plasmids , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs . The [UNK] PTAP mutant , which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment , cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis . After immunoprecipitation with Gag - specific antibodies , western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 ) . Following co - expression of syngag wt and HA - Ub , a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed , which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag . Upon treatment with 14 \u03bcM PR - 619 or 20 \u03bcM P22077 , the intensity of the HA - Ub - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels of the [UNK] PTAP mutant . Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti - CA staining . Thus , treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag . In our previous studies , we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [ 26 , 32 , 48 , 67 ] . To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation , we measured the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [ 26 , 32 , 33 , 48 ] . After transfection of the syngag - SL expression plasmid into He cells , which stably express the murine MHC - I allotype H2 - K b ( referred to as HeLa - K b cells ) [ 68 ] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration - dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 ( Figure 9A ) . Addition of 10 \u03bcM P22077 or 7 \u03bcM PR - 619 led to a 3 - fold increase in SL presentation , while addition of 14 \u03bcM PR - 619 caused an even 10 - fold increase in the SL presentation . To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2 - K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment , the amount of total H2 - K b was quantified , showing similar amounts of H2 - K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR - 619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B ) .

Taken together , these results indicate that DIs , especially those targeting USP7 and USP47 , not only inhibit HIV - 1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC - I pathway .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 977}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1043}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1119, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1250, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1338, "end": 1347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1382}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1470, "end": 1493}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1496, "end": 1514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1609, "end": 1613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1759, "end": 1782}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1785, "end": 1803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1897, "end": 1928}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 1622, "end": 1626}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
