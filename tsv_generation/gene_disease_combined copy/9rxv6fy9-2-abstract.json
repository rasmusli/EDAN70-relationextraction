A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens , and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established ; however , its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic . By contrast , we have previously shown that far - UVC light ( 207 - 222 nm ) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin . This is because , due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer ( non living ) layers of human skin or eye ; however , because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions , far - UVC can penetrate and inactivate them . We show for the first time that far - UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses , with a very low dose of 2 mJ / cm 2 of 222 - nm light inactivating > 95 % of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus . Continuous very low dose - rate far - UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising , safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airbornemediated microbial diseases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 9}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 39}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 57}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1073, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1255, "end": 1274}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
