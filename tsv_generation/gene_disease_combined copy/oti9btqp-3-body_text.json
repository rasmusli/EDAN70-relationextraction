[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] However , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , novel mechanisms of ZIKV transmission have been described including sexual and transplacental transmission . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia and has spread unabated through South America , Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2 years . 8 , 9 Factors including increased global travel and an expansion of the range of Aedes mosquitos owing to climate change portend further spread of this virus , expanding its range in the southern United States over the next few years . 5 , 9 ZIKV infection presents with a prodrome of myalgias , arthralgias , malaise and low - grade fever with a rash appearing approximately 7 days post infection that may occur with conjunctivitis and retro - orbital pain . The clinical presentation is similar to , albeit less severe than , chikungunya and dengue viral infections , which are also transmitted through the same mosquito vectors . During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013 , an increased risk of Guillain Barre ' syndrome was identified in infected individuals . 4 , 6 , 10 Alarmingly , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in infants have been observed in mothers who were infected by ZIKV during pregnancy . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In April 2016 , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly establishing ZIKV as a teratogen . There are currently no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection . Therefore , the development and evaluation of potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent is of high priority . 14 Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic ZIKV prME DNA vaccine delivered by electroporation for its immunogenicity and its impact on ZIKV infection in a pathogenic animal challenge model . 1", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1984, "end": 1998}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 131}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 254}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 589}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 796}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 810}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 820}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 935}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 960}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1030, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1230}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1353, "end": 1366}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1376, "end": 1401}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1612, "end": 1627}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1631, "end": 1644}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1741, "end": 1756}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 2076, "end": 2091}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
