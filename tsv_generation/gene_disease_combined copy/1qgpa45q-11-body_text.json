{"cord_uid": "1qgpa45q", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6941262", "divid": "11", "text": "For the 143 HMPV genomes , we checked sequence conservation at transcriptional control regions , at the termini of each gene , as well as the lengths of intergenic sequences between gene boundaries . The length of the F - M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses , that is , 13 nt and 2 nt , respectively . The SH - G and G - L intergenic regions were the longest , up to 125 nt and to 190 nt , respectively . Consensus nucleotides ( 9 to 19 length ) at the putative start and end regions flanking the ORF of the viral genes are shown in Fig . 1 . The gene - start and - end regions of N and P were conserved ( > 90 % average pairwise identity ) in both HMPV groups , and the M2 and M gene - start and - end were also conserved in HMPV group A and B , respectively . The putative ATG start codon was consistently located at positions 14 - 16 upstream of a gene start motif ( consensus : GG / AGAC / TAAA / GTnnnnATG ) , except for the internal M2 - 2 . An additional ATG start codon upstream of the gene - start motif was observed in the SH gene for the B1 and B2 strains . In five of the eight annotated genes ( N , P , F , M2 , and G ( B1 and B2 strains only ) ) , the intergenic regions were short and the ORFs for these 5 genes terminated within the propositioned gene - end motifs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 25}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 95}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 335, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 526, "end": 530}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 820}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 848, "end": 875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 968, "end": 975}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1137, "end": 1139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1141, "end": 1143}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1145, "end": 1147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1149, "end": 1152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1160}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1233, "end": 1238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1278, "end": 1310}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
