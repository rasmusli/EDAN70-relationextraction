Prominent examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus or the still ongoing human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) pandemic [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Pathogens and their novel hosts lack a co - evolutionary history , which can lead to drastic effects on host populations [ 6 ] . In particular , RNA viruses have a high potential to cross species barriers because of high mutation rates that enable fast adaptive changes [ 7 , 8 ] , which make them prominent among EIDs [ 9 ] . Such RNA viruses have also been suggested to contribute to the recent decline of wild pollinators and losses of managed ones , thereby potentially endangering valuable pollination services [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Thus , it is not surprising that virus transmission between managed honeybees , Apis mellifera , and wild bees has recently been speculated [ 14 , 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 29}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 36}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 311}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 371}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 721}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
