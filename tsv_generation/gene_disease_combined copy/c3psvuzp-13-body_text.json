Analysis of a total of 15 primate PARP4 exon 30 sequences confirmed our initial screening results that this region has evolved under positive selection ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS p - value , 0 . 01 ) ( Figure S2A and Alignment S1 ) . These analyses also identified several codons within exon 30 that display dramatic signatures of recurrent positive selection ( Table S4 ) . For instance , despite being in close proximity in the primary sequence to codons that are strictly conserved across primates , codon 1517 has undergone at least six amino acid changes during approximately 45 million years of simian primate evolution , with a calculated dN / dS ratio . 3 ( Figure 2C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 68}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 686}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
