KFDV is mainly transmitted by ticks belonging to the genus Hemaphysalis but other tick genera have also been shown to be able to transmit KFDV [ 64 , 65 ] . During hemorrhagic KFDV infection , the initial phase is similar to TBEV infection with fever and flu - like symptoms , but it may also include bleeding from the nose , mouth or gastrointestinal tract [ 65 , 66 ] . The second phase , which is experienced by 1 - 20 % of the cases , includes neurological symptoms such as headache , mental disturbance , and tremor , however , no evidence of meninges or encephalitis have been found [ 65 ] . There are about 400 - 500 reported annual cases of KFDV [ 47 ] , with case fatality rates ranging from 3 to 10 % [ 17 , 65 ] . In 1990 a KFDV vaccine was developed , although it provided some protection , due to low efficacy , the number of cases still increased from 1999 to 2012 [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] . Treatment of KFDV is limited to supportive care [ 47 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 113}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 175}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 313}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 334, "end": 361}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 410}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 421}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 445}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 640}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 648, "end": 657}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 678}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 691}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 743}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 819, "end": 824}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 910}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
