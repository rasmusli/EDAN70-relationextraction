In TBFV infection , viperin was shown to control LGTV dissemination and replication in the brain after intraperitoneal administration , and viperin promoted survival after intracranial infection [ 141 ] . Interestingly , viperin has been shown to be expressed in the brain at the basal state [ 128 ] , with high basal expression in primary astrocytes [ 100 , 141 ] . Viperin ' s role within the brain during neurotropic LGTV infection was further mapped to certain brain regions , as viperin inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum , but not in the cerebellum or brainstem . This correlates very well with TBEV infection since viperin strongly inhibited TBEV replication in primary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum , but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum . Interestingly , cortical neurons were completely dependent on viperin for IFN - mediated inhibition of TBEV , whereas in astrocytes , in which the IFN - mediated antiviral activities are strongly dependent on viperin , other ISGs could partly compensate for loss of viperin [ 141 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 309}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 653}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 819}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1043}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1051}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 179}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 596}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 805}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
