{"cord_uid": "sb3ccvsk", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5030268", "divid": "16", "text": "While neither CNS antiviral function nor demyelination were affected by Foxp3 + Treg depletion , a potential increase in virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells may be unapparent due to their low frequencies in the CNS . Specifically , SR CD4 + T cell frequencies are low within the CNS , although higher than in CLN ( 13 ) . To verify that their increased numbers in CLN do not lead to enhanced circulation and recruitment to the CNS , we used ELISPOT to determine frequencies of both virus - specific and SR T cells in the CNS . Frequencies as well as total numbers of IFN - \u03b3 secreting M 133 - specific CD4 + T cells were indeed similar in the CNS of both groups ( Figure 5 ) . Contrasting the CLN , both frequencies and total numbers of IFN - \u03b3 secreting MOG 35 \u2212 55 - and MBP 60 \u2212 80 - specific CD4 + T cells were also identical within the CNS of DT - treated DTR \u2212 and DTR + mice ( Figure 5 ) . These data were consistent with similar demyelination and supported a limited role for Foxp3 + Tregs in controlling the CNS SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 85}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 577}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 1000}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 55}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 953}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1063, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
