The first report came from Zhang et a l . who were interested in blocking Kaposi ' s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) lytic replication [ 84 ] . They explored the effects of the inhibition of the expression of KSHV latency - associated nuclear antigen ( LANA ) and replication and transcription activator ( RTA ) , two factors involved in latency maintenance and in the switch to lytic phase , respectively . To do so , the investigators designed PMOs directed against LANA and RTA and covalently conjugated them at their 5 ' terminal to R 5 F 2 R 4 C peptide . While fluorescein ( Fl ) - labeled PMOs entered cells poorly , Fl - PPMOs were efficiently taken up by BCBL - 1 lymphocytes which , as emphasized by the authors , are difficult to efficiently transfect with common techniques such as lipofectamine . PPMOs could effectively inhibit RTA and LANA protein expression in cell culture . Treatment of KSHV - infected cells with RTA PPMO suppressed KSHV lytic replication . RTA knock down resulted in reduced levels of proteins expressed downstream of RTA . One of these downstream proteins is viral interleukin - 6 ( vIL - 6 ) and is thought to be essential for the development of KSVH - associated diseases . In a subsequent study , Zhang et al . blocked the expression of vIL - 6 with PPMOs . vIL - 6 PMOs were covalently conjugated at their 5 ' to ( RXR ) 4 XB or R 5 F 2 R 4 C . PPMO treatment inhibited vIL - 6 expression , which in turn reduced human IL - 6 level and KSHV yield , and reduced growth of treated cells [ 85 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 478}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 484}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 647}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 655}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1029}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1106, "end": 1110}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1229, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1293}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1295, "end": 1303}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1452, "end": 1460}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1473, "end": 1481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1586, "end": 1594}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 282}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1359, "end": 1386}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
