Two anti - FcRn antibodies were used : 1 ) Anti - FcRn antibody purified from rabbit serum raised against a2 ( 88 - 177aa ) and a3 ( 1782 - 247aa ) domains of human FcRn ( provided by Neil Simister , Brandeis University ) for use on frozen sections ( Figure 5 ) , and 2 ) rabbit anti - FcRn antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals for use on paraffin sections following citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) antigen retrieval ( Figure S7 ) . Sections were blocked with serum - free protein solution , and optimally diluted primary FcRn antibodies or rabbit IgG ( negative control ) were added and incubated for 1 - 2 hours at RT . Binding of antibodies to FcRn in tissues was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase detection system that stains positive cells bright red . Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover - slipped using aqueous mounting medium .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 25}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 116}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 195, "end": 213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 245}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 627}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 641}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 741}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 776, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
