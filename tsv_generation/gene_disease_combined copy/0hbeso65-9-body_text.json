Within weeks after transplant , viral loads would be approximately 1 log higher than pretransplant levels [ 4 , 15 ] . However , studies investigating the impact of pretransplant viral load on the likelihood of HCV recurrence have produced controversial results . Several reports indicated that pretransplant viral load did not correlate with either the likelihood or timing of HCV recurrence following LT [ 16 ] . By contrast , one study including 166 HCV - infected recipients demonstrated that before transplant , HCV viral load greater than 1 million viral equivalents / mL was associated with decreased graft and patient survival [ 17 ] . Given the hypothesis that pretransplant treatment of HCV will reduce or prevent HCV posttransplant recurrence , it has been advocated that patients with HCV infection on the transplant list should be considered for therapy with the goal of obtaining sustained virological response ( SVR ) prior to LT [ 18 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 352}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 519}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 594}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 865}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 934, "end": 948}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
