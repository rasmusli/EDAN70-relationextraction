The currently circulating EV - D68 US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 strains are similar to the Fermon strain in clinical characteristics and genome structure , but it is not known whether they are similar in virulence and ability to manipulate the cell cycle . Therefore , we compared the US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 strains to the Fermon strain . Under normal culture conditions , RD cells were infected with three strains virus at an MOI of 0 . 8 for 24 h , respectively , the TCID50 / mL of the US / MO / 14 - 18947 strain ( 43 . 07 \u00b1 10 . 22 \u00d7 10 5 ) was 29 . 76 times higher and the TCID50 / mL of the US / KY / 14 - 18953 ( 195 . 00 \u00b1 54 . 03 \u00d7 10 5 ) was 138 . 29 higher than the TCID50 / mL of the Fermon strain ( 1 . 40 \u00b1 0 . 16 \u00d7 10 5 ) ( Figure 2B ) . These results suggest that the EV - D68 virulence has increased over time , which could explain the recent rise in the incidence of Enterovirus - related disease ( Esposito et al . , 2015 ; Farrell et al . , 2015 ; Reiche et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 133}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 151}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
