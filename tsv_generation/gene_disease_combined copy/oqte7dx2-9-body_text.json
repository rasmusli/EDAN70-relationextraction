( 2009 ) discovered that an inbred strain of mice ( CS strain ) known to have defects in circadian rhythms , also exhibits changes in depression - like behaviors consistent with an anti - depressive state . Quantitative trait locus mapping of the CS mice identified a 3bp deletion in a conserved lysine ( K92 ) in USP46 . Importantly , USP46 knock - out ( KO ) mice exhibit similar changes in depression - like behaviors ( Imai et al . , 2013 ) and broad expression of a wild type USP46 transgene in CS mice rescued these behaviors ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ) . The magnitude of behavioral effects in the USP46 ( K92 ) mutant mice were not as strong as those observed in USP46 KO mice ( Imai et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that the K92 mutation does not completely eliminate USP46 activity . Indeed , in vitro deubiquitination assays revealed that USP46 ( K92 ) still retains some enzymatic activity ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 427}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 582}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 863}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 938}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 237}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 335}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 506}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 588}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
