Proteins involved in the RNAi mediated response such as Argonaute 30 ( Ago30 ) , Ago 16 and Dicer ( Dcr ) 90 were subsequently identified as inhibitors of LGTV [ 93 ] . Furthermore RNA - seq and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that when challenged by TBEV infection , tick cells upregulated genes involved in immunity and metabolism , whereas genes involved in cellular stress were downregulated [ 94 ] . Using gene silencing approaches , this study confirmed the antiviral effect of Ago 30 and Dcr 90 in tick cells . Furthermore , novel antiviral genes such as complement factor H , heat shock protein ( HSP ) 70 and 90 and trypsin was found to inhibit LGTV in tick cells [ 94 ] . Taken together , studies so far have identified activation and antiviral actions of the RNAi mediated response in tick cells as well as other inhibitory proteins such as HSP70 , HSP90 , and trypsin .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 309}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 689, "end": 696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 707}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 743, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 767, "end": 787}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 826}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 838}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1029, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1057, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1077, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 461}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
