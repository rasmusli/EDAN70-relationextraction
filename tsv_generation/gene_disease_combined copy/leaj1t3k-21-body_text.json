Studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo . One study found that both PPMO - and PMO - treated mice survived EBOV lethal challenge ( 100 % and 85 % respectively , the difference being not statistically significant ) [ 78 ] . However , other comparative reports clearly document that PPMO are far more effective than PMOs in mice . PPMOs offered 100 % protection against EBOV infection at 5 - \u03bcg and 50 - \u03bcg doses while PMOs gave only 15 % protection at 50 - \u03bcg doses [ 64 ] . PPMOs increased survival of DENV - infected mice up to eight days whereas PMOs did not provide any survival benefit [ 70 ] . PMOs could not protect mice against WNV infection while PPMOs , even at doses 10 - fold lower , delayed clinical signs and increased WNV - infected mice survival by 60 % [ 67 ] . The differential activities observed in EBOV studies may be explained by the fact that Swenson et a l . used the ( RXR ) 4 XB peptide while Enterlein et al . linked their PMO to the R 9 F 2 C peptide .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 64}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 518}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 637, "end": 642}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 770, "end": 784}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 871}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 958}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
