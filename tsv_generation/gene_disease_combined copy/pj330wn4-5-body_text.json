The ciliaFA software allowed automated , high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency ( range 3 to 52 Hz ) and avoids operator error due to selection bias . We have included free access to the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 381, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
