In virus - producing cells , IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles . Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells . This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 83}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 507}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
