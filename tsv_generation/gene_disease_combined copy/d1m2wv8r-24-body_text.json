As p53 is known as an important anti - cancer protein , these proteins could be related to cancer development . For instance , API5 was enriched in this network , and the API5 expression level was reduced in F81 cells at 48 hpi and 60 hpi . API5 is an apoptosis inhibitory protein that can suppress E2F - dependent apoptosis 44 . It is frequently up - regulated in tumour cells and functions as a master regulator of immune escape genes in tumours 45 . Based on these findings , CPV may be a powerful apoptosis - modulating agent that could down - regulate API5 gene expression .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 431}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 552}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 611}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 226}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 500}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 576}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
