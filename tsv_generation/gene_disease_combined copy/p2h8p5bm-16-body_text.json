The attachment is mediated by viral E protein and entry receptor on the host cell . The entry receptor for TBFVs has not been identified , but attachment to heparan sulphate and glycosaminoglycan , which are present in abundance on many cell types of both vertebrates and ticks , is predicted to play a role during binding and entry [ 72 ] . Once the virus has entered the cell , it is transported to endosomes , where the acidic environment of these vesicles leads to reorganization and conformational change of the E protein , resulting in the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane and the release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] . The viral RNA ( vRNA ) also functions as mRNA , associating with ribosomes to produce the polyprotein . The transmembrane domain of the viral protein is recognized as a signal peptide and recruits the vRNA / ribosomes / nascent polypeptide complex to the ER membrane , where it is co - translationally translocated into the ER membrane [ 76 , 77 ] . The nascent polypeptide is then processed by the cellular and viral proteases into structural and non - structural ( NS ) viral proteins . Some of the viral proteins such as NS2B , NS4A , and NS4B integrate and alter the membrane of the ER to form a membrane vesicular structure , with a small pore connecting the interior of the vesicle to the cytoplasm [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] . These vesicles are the site for the formation of replication complexes ( RC ) and RNA replication [ 80 , 82 , 83 ] . Following RNA replication , genomic RNA is proposed to exit the vesicle through the vesicular pore and is packaged by C proteins into the NC on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane [ 82 , 84 , 85 ] . During the process of budding of NC from the cytoplasm into the ER , it acquires the lipid envelope along with E and prM proteins , which are associated with the ER membrane . The mechanism that ensures efficient incorporation of NC into the ER membrane with the E and prM protein is poorly understood . Following budding into the ER lumen , the immature virions are transported through the cellular secretory pathways in a COPI and COPII dependent manner [ 86 ] to the extracellular medium . The immature virion has heterodimers of E and prM that completely cover the lipid bilayer to form a spiky proteinaceous coat . During the transport through the Golgi , the E protein is glycosylated [ 87 ] . The acidic environment of the Golgi induces conformational changes in the E and prM proteins , which exposes a cleavage site on prM . Cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin results in the formation of a mature virion [ 88 , 89 ] . Mature virions are then released by exocytosis , which completes the viral life cycle [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] ( Figure 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 193}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 674}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 828}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 855, "end": 860}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1213, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1301}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1315, "end": 1330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1338, "end": 1343}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1345, "end": 1350}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1356, "end": 1361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1605, "end": 1627}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1629, "end": 1632}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1701, "end": 1713}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1791, "end": 1802}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1811, "end": 1814}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1909, "end": 1912}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1987, "end": 2006}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 2106, "end": 2109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 260}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
