After washing 3 times in PBS - T for 5 minutes , the slides were embedded with a mounting fluid , topped with a cover glass , and observed under a fluorescent microscope . The neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples were measured by PRNT . The PRNT procedures were performed as follows . In brief , 1 : 10 diluted sera were heat - inactivated at 56 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes . Heat - inactivated sera were diluted serially 4 - fold . After an equal volume of virus ( MERS - CoV / KOR / KNIH / 002 _ 05 _ 2015 ) was added to the volume of serum dilutions , these mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 2 hours . The mixtures were added to each well of the 24 - well plate cultured with Vero cells . The plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes , and 1 mL of 1 . 5 % carboxymethylcellulose overlay medium was then added . After incubation for 3 - 4 days , cell staining was performed by crystal violet . The titer of neutralizing antibody by PRNT 50 was calculated using the K\u00e4rber formula , as described previously [ 22 ] . A titer above 1 : 20 was interpreted as positive . All sera with a positive or borderline reaction in ELISA were tested by the IFA and PRNT assays for confirmation , and cases with positive results from any 2 assays were con - sidered to be anti - MERS positive .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 692}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 703}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1365, "end": 1387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1390, "end": 1395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1608, "end": 1613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 16}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 54, "end": 59}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 208}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
