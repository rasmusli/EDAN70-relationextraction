J\u00e4rver et al . suggested that siRNAs could be less amenable to CPP delivery due to charge interactions between the peptide and the siRNA and inefficient endosomal escape of the conjugates [ 30 ] . To our knowledge , the only report of CPP - mediated delivery of antiviral siRNA is from Meng et al . who constructed a cell - permeable siRNA targeting hepatitis C virus 5 ' untranslated region [ 102 ] . The siRNA was crosslinked at its 3 ' end with the tat peptide . The authors reported the cellular uptake and antiviral effect of the CPP - siRNA as being as efficient as transfection with lipofectamine in Huh - 7 cell culture . However , some cell types being refractory to lipofectamine transfection which can moreover be toxic in vivo , CPP - mediated delivery of siRNA is definitely worth investigating in other cell types and in animal models of viral infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 34}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 507}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 558}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 662}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 883, "end": 889}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 477}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
