Gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) and striped skunks ( Mephitis mephitis ) displaying symptoms of rabies were submitted for rabies testing in the Humboldt Co . Public Health Laboratory between March 2009 and January 2010 . Brain tissue samples that were laboratory confirmed to be infected with rabies virus were forwarded to CDPH - VRDL for genetic characterization . Other earlier skunk and fox tissue samples from Humboldt Co . were also available from the CDPH - VRDL archives . As part of routine rabies surveillance in California , the VRDL genotypes rabies - positive samples received from local public health laboratories by RT - PCR and performs sequence analysis on RT - PCR products using forward primer 1066 deg 59 - GARAGAAGATTCTTCAGRGA - 39 and reverse primer 304 targeting a portion of the nucleoprotein ( N ) gene as described in Trimarchi and Smith ( 2002 ) and Velasco - Villa , et al . ( 2006 ) [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] . Approximately 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk rabies virus variant were placed in TRIzol LS Reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and sent to LLNL for further analysis . RNA was extracted from the tissue sample following the manufacturer ' s protocol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 866, "end": 884}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 890, "end": 905}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 968}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 155}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 263}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 295}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 321}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 492}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 699}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1228}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
