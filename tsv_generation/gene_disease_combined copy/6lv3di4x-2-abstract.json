For JEV and some other flaviviruses , oronasal transmission is described , but the mode of infection is unknown . Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells ( NEC ) at the air - liquid interface ( ALI ) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs . Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines , indicating infection and replication in macrophages . Moreover , macrophages stimulated by alarmins , including interleukin - 25 , interleukin - 33 , and thymic stromal lymphopoietin , were more permissive to the JEV infection . Altogether , our data are important to understand the mechanism of nonvector - borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs . IMPORTANCE JEV , a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans , has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito - waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs , which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes , leading to increased human cases . JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors . Moreover , virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium . Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three - dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus . Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages , which is favored by epithelial - cell - derived cytokines . The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non - vector - borne direct transmission of JEV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 829, "end": 846}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1427, "end": 1437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1843, "end": 1874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1951, "end": 1989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 55}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 103}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 175}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 543, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 600}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 915}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1084, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1132}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1322, "end": 1326}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
