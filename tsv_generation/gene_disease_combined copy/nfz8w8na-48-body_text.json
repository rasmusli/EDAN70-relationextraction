In the case of Zika in Brazil , the communities most vulnerable to the virus are those with insufficient resources and infrastructure ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ) . Consequently , Zika has been socially distributed to exacerbate conditions of poverty . However , the voices of these most affected people are drowned out by more powerful and prestigious groups . This is seen in the comparison that Lotufo ( 2016 ) makes between the politics of HIV / AIDS and the politics of Zika ( Lotufo 2016 ) . HIV / AIDS research in Brazil procured greater funding because those affected tended to be very notable Brazilians with more dominant social and politics voices ( Lotufo 2016 ) . The same pattern was reported in relationship to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia , where weak public health infrastructure aggravated Liberian experiences of Ebola ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 ; Scott et al . 2016 ) , while interventions targeted cultural practices , ultimately disempowering the economically disadvantaged ( Garbuglia 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 152}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 315}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 585}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 628, "end": 639}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 860, "end": 866}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 963, "end": 969}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
