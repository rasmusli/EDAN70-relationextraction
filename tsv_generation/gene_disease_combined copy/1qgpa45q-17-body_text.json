It has also been suggested that the low diversity in F gene might make a substantial contribution to cross - neutralization and cross - protection between the HMPV subgroups [ 21 ] . The relatively high frequency of amino acid diversity in G ( and to a lesser extent SH ) could be attributable to selective pressure for amino acid change coming from host immunity ; and the ability of the protein to tolerate substitutions , which might be due to its proposed extended , unfolded nature [ 22 ] . The phylogenetic incongruence observed between whole genome tree and the F and G gene trees , is as reported previously for HMPV [ 23 ] , and could be attributed to differential rates of evolution , selection pressure or past recombination events [ 24 ] . The prevalence of HMPV in hospitalized pediatric population in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya has been reported [ 7 , 25 ] . However , it is notable that in recent years , HMPV has been detected at low prevalence in Kilifi ( unpublished observations from hospital - based pneumonia surveillance ) . Whether this low prevalence is due to reduced virus transmission , or decreased sensitivity of our HMPV molecular diagnostic assay due to progressive primer / probe mismatches , is yet to be established .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 377}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 860, "end": 878}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 888}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 899}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1241, "end": 1246}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
