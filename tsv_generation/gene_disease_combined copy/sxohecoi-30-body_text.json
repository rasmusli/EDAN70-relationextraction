We have also shown that FcRn is present on epithelial cells in areas of the genital tract that are potentially exposed to HIV - 1 during sexual intercourse . Our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV - 1 may be facilitated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 175}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
