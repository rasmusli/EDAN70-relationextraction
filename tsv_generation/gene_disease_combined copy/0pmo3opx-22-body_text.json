Briefly , 0 . 2 \u00b5g / mL recombinant human APN from R & D Systems ( catalog # : 3815 - ZN - 010 ) and matched no - enzyme control were assayed against a diverse library of 228 tetradecapeptides pooled at 500 nM in D - PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 mM TCEP . After 1 , 15 , 60 , 240 , and 1200 min , 30 \u00b5L of assay mixture was removed , quenched with 7 . 5 \u00b5L 20 % formic acid , and flash - frozen in liquid N 2 . Prior to mass spectrometry acquisition , peptide samples were desalted using C 18 desalting tips and rehydrated in 0 . 2 % formic acid . LC - MS / MS data were acquired using a Thermo Scientific LTQ - FT mass spectrometer , which was equipped with a Thermo Scientific EASY - Spray Ion Source , EASY - Spray PepMap C 18 Column ( 3 \u00b5M , 100 \u00c5 ) , and Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC System .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 108}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 108}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
