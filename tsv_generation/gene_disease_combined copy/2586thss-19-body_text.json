{"cord_uid": "2586thss", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3573733", "divid": "19", "text": "In this present study , we characterized the immunoreactivity of recombinant HCV polypeptides derived from many different regions of the HCV polyprotein expressed in bacteria . The purpose of synthesizing these segments is to determine which segments encoded by the genome are significant for the development of anti - HCV assays and to find a multiple epitope fusion antigen which incorporates all of the major immunodominant epitopes from the functional regions of the HCV genome . Therefore , we first constructed the different HCV segments into vectors containing His - tag or GST - tag to induce expression . The proteins were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as fusion proteins with a 26 kDa GST - tag or 18 kDa His - tag used for detection and affinity purification . The immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti - HCV sera . Our results showed that the recombinant soluble proteins were expressed successfully . The sera studied recognized the core and NS3 protein at very high levels , whereas the other proteins , such as NS4B , NS4A , NS5A and NS5B , were found to have lower levels of reactivity . The E2 protein rarely reacted with anti - HCV positive serum . Thus , the core protein in combination with a new NS3 protein ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) constitutes almost all of the major immunogenic proteins of the HCV . However , this study does not exclude the possibility that the low reactivity to some HCV antigens is due to a quantitative reduction in the titer of antibodies and not due to an absence of reactivity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 436}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 482}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 581, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 690, "end": 707}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 727}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 943, "end": 972}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1055}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1114, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1121, "end": 1126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1137, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1266, "end": 1279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1305, "end": 1317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1372, "end": 1393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1492, "end": 1505}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
