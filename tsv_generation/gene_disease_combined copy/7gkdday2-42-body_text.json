The findings corroborate the concept of viruses being the most common causative agent of ARIs and the data are consistent with hospital - based findings in Bangladesh reported by Homaira et al . [ 11 ] and the comparable ' s were also published from Laos and Egypt [ 35 , 36 ] . However , many studies in other regions including Brazil , Niger , Zambia , Spain , and Mexico reported higher viral detection rates ranging from 65 - 87 % [ 26 , [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] . The disparity in viral detection rates among these study findings might be due to variation in numbers of viruses that were included in the viral panel of each study group . Our viral panel included ten common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , human rhinovirus ( HRV ) , influenza A and B viruses , human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 ( HPIV1 , HPIV2 , HPIV3 ) , human metapneumo virus ( HMPV ) , human bocavirus ( HBoV ) , and adenovirus . However , the panel did not include coronavirus which may account for a certain percentage of infections . 31 . 5 % specimens were positive for HRV , which was predominantly detected as a viral pathogen . However , the incidence rate of HRV was also higher in asymptomatic cases ( 23 % ) . Interestingly , the detection rate of adenovirus was higher in asymptomatic cases ( 10 % ) than the symptomatic specimens ( 7 % ) . A study conducted by Singleton et al . also frequently identified HRV and adenoviruses in healthy children [ 41 ] , which makes it difficult to make any inference regarding the association of these two viruses with respiratory illness . RSV was the second most prevalent virus identified in 31 % cases . However , unlike HRV , RSV has been reported as a recurrent cause of ARI in both children younger than five years old and adult , with incidence reaching 26 % ( Laos PDR ) , 33 % ( Mexico ) , 35 % ( Niger ) , 37 % ( Brazil ) , 51 % ( Germany ) , 57 % ( India ) , and 76 % ( Spain ) of the investigated cases [ 35 , 37 - 40 , 42 , 43 ] . RSV can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections . After RSV , HMPV ( 13 % ) , HBoV ( 11 % ) and HPIV - 3 ( 10 . 5 % ) came out as the third , fourth , and fifth most prevalent viral agents . However , we observed relatively low pathogen detection rates for HPIV - 1 , HPIV - 2 , influenza A , and influenza B viruses . Thus after RSV , HMPV , HBoV , and HPIVs came out as the frequent causes of hospitalization of children with respiratory illness and the findings are consistent with other published data [ 24 ] . Approximately 70 - 89 % cases of bronchiolitis had been reported to associate with RSV infection and 3 - 25 % with parainfluenza viruses and there werek very few cases of bronchiolitis which could be attributed to human influenza virus and adenovirus [ 44 , 45 ] . Several studies have described frequencies of 3 . 3 - 19 % for HMPV infections in hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections [ 7 , [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] , although HMPV has been known to cause severe respiratory infections in the elderly [ 48 , 49 ] . The frequency of HBoV identified in this study ( 11 % ) was also comparable with HBoV detection rates in Spain ( 9 . 9 % ) and Vietnam ( 7 . 2 % ) [ 50 , 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 232}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 878}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1034}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1726, "end": 1746}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1884, "end": 1888}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
