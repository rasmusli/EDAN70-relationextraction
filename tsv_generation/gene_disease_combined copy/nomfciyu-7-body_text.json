The origin of the virus is believed to be bats , from which it was then transferred to camels . Camels are currently regarded as a major host for MERS - CoV . It has also been identified as the most significant source for human infections [ 1 ] . The isolates of MERS - CoV from camels and humans have also been found to more than 99 % identical [ 2 ] . While camels have been identified as the primary source of MERS - CoV infection through both indirect as well as direct contact , the specific route and role of camels in disease transmission is yet to be identified .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 305}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 576}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
