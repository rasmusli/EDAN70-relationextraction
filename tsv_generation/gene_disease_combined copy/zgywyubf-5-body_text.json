As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens , NF - \u03baB activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral , bacterial , and parasitic infections [ 1 ] . However , many viruses such as HIV , exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through \u03baB response elements located in their promoters [ 2 ] . On the contrary , many pathogens such as African swine fever virus , HIV - 1 and cowpox virus [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF - \u03baB responses . Inhibition of NF - \u03baB activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 88}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 476}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 503}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 680}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 330}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 373}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 578}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 588}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 605}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
