Consistent with other investigations of Fc - FcRn interactions , maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5 . 5 - 6 . 0 , with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4 . 5 and 6 . 5 ( Figure S3H ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Since FcRn binds to IgG and not to IgA , we compared two different IgG1 mAbs , b12 and HGN194 , with their IgA class - switched versions . Both IgG1 mAbs enhanced transcytosis of HIV - 1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL - p at pH 6 . 0 , whereas the IgA class - switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . In fact , as reported , dimeric IgA1 HGN194 inhibited transcytosis [ 40 ] . Thus , enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by IgG and is dependent on FcRn .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 543}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 621}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 648, "end": 658}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 762}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 843, "end": 863}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 990}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1015}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
