These observations , in addition to the modified histology activity index ( HAI ) scores , indicated that expression of HCV proteins caused chronic hepatitis in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice because a weak , though persistent , immune response followed an initial bout of acute hepatitis ( Figure S1 ) . Moreover , we observed a number of other pathological changes in these mice - including swelling of hepatocytes , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , abnormal accumulation of glycogen , steatosis , fibrosis , and HCC ( Figures 1E and F , Table S1 ) . Steatosis was mild in the younger mice ( day 21 ) and became increasingly severe over time ( days 120 and 180 ; Figure S2 ) . Importantly , none of the pathological changes were observed in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 1F ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 378}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 524}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 746}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 748, "end": 757}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 767}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 801, "end": 811}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
