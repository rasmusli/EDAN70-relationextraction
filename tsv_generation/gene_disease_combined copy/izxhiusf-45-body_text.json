{"cord_uid": "izxhiusf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3420249", "divid": "45", "text": "In preschool children with persistent wheezing unresponsive to adequate inhaled asthma treatment , bacterial infection is frequent , with NTHi , S . pneumoniae and M . catarrhalis being the main pathogens involved . These microbiological findings and the presence of a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation in BAL - fluid , sampled in patients not presenting an acute exacerbation episode , favours the hypothesis that chronic bacterial infection is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy in these young patients . These elements suggest that the use of antibiotic treatment , although not currently recommended , should be considered in selected young children presenting with chronic wheezing . However , as these patients are indistinguishable without the use of invasive procedures , and biofilm formation and other escape mechanisms may decrease the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotic treatment , additional research is necessary before specific treatment recommendations can be provided . Future research should focus on population characteristics , determination of risk factors for acquisition of bacterial bronchial infection , pathogenicity mechanisms of chronic bronchial infection and possible prevention and treatment strategies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 47}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 119}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 306}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 446}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 539}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 748, "end": 765}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1206}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1264}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
