Study participants reported most frequently rhinitis ( 26 . 6 % ) , followed by influenza - like illness ( 11 . 4 % ) and pharyngitis / laryngitis ( 10 . 5 % ) , whereas pleurisy ( 0 . 10 % ) was rarely experienced . Any URTI ( 31 . 5 % ) was more frequent than any LRTI ( 7 . 9 % ) . Apart from the LRTIs bronchitis , pneumonia and pleurisy , which more men than women reported , all other RTIs were more prevalent among women ( Table 2 ) . Seasonal patterns of reported infections show a February peak for two of the three assessed infection seasons ( 2012 / 13 and 2014 / 15 , see Additional file 5 ) . Respiratory infections with a high fraction of long duration were almost exclusively LRTIs , namely pneumonia ( 59 % ) , followed by bronchitis ( 48 . 2 % ) .
