To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of these DIs on the in vitro processing of HIV - 1 Gag . Purified VLPs derived from the p [UNK] R PR \u2212 construct [ 32 ] , encoding a protease deficient HIV - 1 mutant virus , were lysed and incubated with 2 . 56 \u00b5M of the HIV - 1 PR . No effect on the protease activity was observed for PR - 619 or P22077 ( In contrast , addition of the DI P5091 , which is selective for USP7 , had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ) . Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2 - fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR - 619 , whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication . Although the DI P22077 and PR - 619 clearly reduced Gag processing , none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 163}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 447}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 475}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 617}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 728}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 801, "end": 810}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 977, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 997}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1017}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 370}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
