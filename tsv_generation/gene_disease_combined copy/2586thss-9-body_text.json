The DAS - LFIA device for the detection of anti - HCV antibodies was manufactured by Artron BioResearch Inc . First , we optimized the conditions for the colloidal gold conjugation of the purified antigen and the coating of the gold - conjugated recombinant protein on non - woven fabric sheets . Colloidal gold is used as an indicator for the presence of antigens binding to the membrane on the rapid lateral flow test strip . After the proteins are bound to colloidal gold to form the conjugate , the fabric sheets are placed in a dry room for at least 2 h for drying . Subsequently , the purified antigen , diluted in PBS , is coated on the test region . Simultaneously , HCV IgG polyclonal antibody , diluted in PBS , is coated on the control region . The coated membrane is dried for a minimum of 24 h and then blocked with a particular blocking solution . Finally , the test strip is assembled such that everything slightly overlaps in order to allow for the continuous lateral flow of the liquid sample . The test strip has an absorption pad , a strip of membrane , a conjugate fibre and other fibres to hold the conjugate fibre in place . Instructions on how to assemble a test strip were provided by Artron BioResearch Inc . The combination of the coating protein , conjugate protein , conjugate fibre and dialysis buffer forms a ' system ' in a test strip . The test strip developed was tested with different positive and negative HCV sera . I - LFIA was manufactured using IgG antibody conjugating colloidal gold instead of antigen .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 749}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 816, "end": 844}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1398, "end": 1414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1416, "end": 1434}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1593, "end": 1602}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1625, "end": 1638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1676, "end": 1684}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
