RSV was the most common agent isolated , and occurred with considerable temporal variation . As for many other common childhood infections , such as diarrhea , the occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several respiratory viruses , highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures in resource - poor settings .
