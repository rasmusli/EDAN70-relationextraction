{"cord_uid": "iv2dcpqj", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4576194", "divid": "9", "text": "To determine which domain ( s ) of eEF1A is responsible for the association with NS5A , a series of Myc - tagged deletion mutants of eEF1A were constructed ( Figure 2A ) and tested for the interaction with NS5A by Co - IP assay . The results showed that eEF1A ( 1 - 133 ) and eEF1A ( 1 - 237 ) were capable of binding NS5A ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that the domain I is critical for the NS5A - eEF1A interaction . in a yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) system . Yeast Y2HGold strain was cotransformed with pGBKT7 - NS5A ( BD - NS5A ) as a bait and pGADT7 - eEF1A ( AD - eEF1A ) as a prey . As a positive control , pGBKT7 - p53 ( BD - p53 ) and pGADT7 - T ( AD - T ) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain . Cotransformation of pGBKT7 - Lamin C ( BD - Lamin C ) and AD - T was used as a negative control . All the yeast colonies cotransformed with the above plasmids were grown on synthetically defined ( SD ) medium lacking His and Leu ( SD / - 2 ) , SD medium lacking His , Leu , Trp and Ade ( SD / - 4 ) and SD / - 4 medium containing 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - \u03b1 - D - galactopyranoside ( X - \u03b1 - Gal ) and aureobasidin A ( Aba ) ( SD / - 4 / X - \u03b1 - Gal / Aba ) ; ( B ) Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pulldown assay . The GST or GST - NS5A fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) were purified with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with the lysate of HEK293T cells overexpressing the Myc - tagged eEF1A . After washing with cold PBS , the bound proteins were subjected to sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( 10 % ) and Western blotting using the anti - GST polyclonal antibody ( PAb ) ( 1 : 2000 ) and the anti - Myc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( 1 : 1000 ) ; ( C ) Coimmunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) analysis of Myc - tagged eEF1A and Flag - tagged NS5A . HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids ( + ) or empty vectors ( - ) for 48 h . The transfected cells were lyzed and incubated with a mouse anti - Flag MAb , followed by incubation with the Protein G - Agarose for 6 h at 4 \u02dd C . The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti - Flag MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) and a rabbit anti - Myc PAb ( 1 : 500 ) ; ( D ) Co - IP analysis of eEF1A and NS5A by the anti - Myc MAb . HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids ( + ) or empty vectors ( \u00b4 ) , the cell lysate was collected at 48 h post - transfection ( hpt ) , incubated with the anti - Myc MAb and Protein G - Agarose . The immunoprecipitate was examined by Western blotting using the anti - Flag MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) and the anti - Myc PAb ( 1 : 500 ) ; ( E ) Effects of RNase A / T1 treatment on the NS5A - eEF1A interaction . Extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing different proteins were treated or untreated with RNase A / T1 for 1 h prior to Co - IP and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies . The total RNA in the immunoprecipitate was visualized by ethidium bromide - staining ; ( F ) Colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A . HEK293T cells were cotransfected with p3\u02c6Flag - NS5A and pMyc - eEF1A . Cells were fixed at 48 hpt and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect 3\u02c6Flag - NS5A ( green ) and Myc - eEF1A ( red ) with mouse anti - Flag and rabbit anti - Myc antibodies . The position of the nucleus is indicated by DAPI ( blue ) staining in the merged image . Samples were imaged and magnified 630 times on the Leica SP2 confocal system fitted with a 63\u02c6objective lens .
