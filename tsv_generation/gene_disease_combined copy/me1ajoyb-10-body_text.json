While some of these assays are IgG - specific , others use antiserum to whole IgG , including the light chains . Since light chains are shared by all immunoglobulins , these detection antibodies are not IgG - specific . Moreover , no assays are in place for detecting IgA , which should be prominent in mucosal infections . IgM assays have been problematic despite the availability of anti - IgM capture antisera that are cross - reactive with IgM from at least one hantavirus reservoir species [ 44 ] . Some immunoglobulins have isotypes with specific effector activities , such as complement fixation or antibody - dependent cell cytotoxicity . Laboratory house mice have four IgG isotypes ; IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b and IgG3 . It is likely that reservoirs also have immunoglobulin isotypes with distinct effector functions and which might predominate during hantavirus infections . These reagent deficiencies are a current obstacle for assessing antibody responses in rodent reservoir hosts . Despite these limitations , many field studies have been conducted examining antibody responses in natural and semi - natural hantavirus infections of rodent reservoirs [ 34 , [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 252, "end": 256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 446}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 502}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 570}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 699}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 866}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 873}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 883, "end": 889}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 893, "end": 898}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 963}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 71}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 496}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 651}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1053}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1292, "end": 1303}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
