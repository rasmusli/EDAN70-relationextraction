{"cord_uid": "sb3ccvsk", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5030268", "divid": "19", "text": "Irrespective of the overall common suppressive action in draining LN during viral infection , the function of endogenous Foxp3 + Treg migrating to and residing in the CNS throughout persistence remains obscure . Despite the prolonged reduction of Tregs by DT - mediated depletion , we found no evidence of altered pathogenesis . Regulation of the CNS autoimmune responses by Foxp3 + Tregs is also ineffective during EAE ( 48 ) . Despite Foxp3 + Treg accumulation within the inflamed CNS , their functions were abrogated by pro - inflammatory cytokines IL - 6 and TNF . Expression of both cytokines during JHMV infection ( 49 ) suggests they may have similar suppressive activity on local Foxp3 + Treg . Alternatively , a potential deficit of Foxp3 + Treg access to CNS demyelinating lesions , with perivascular retention , may explain their inability to regulate CNS inflammation and will require further investigation . It is also possible that residual Foxp3 + Tregs detected 1 week after DT treatment may be sufficient to control CNS inflammation . The minor Foxp3 + Treg population detected at day 28 p . i . presumably comprises rebound Tregs , as well as a small proportion of DT insensitive Foxp3 + cells detected in adult DEREG mice ( 23 ) . While rebound Tregs are dysfunctional ( 28 ) , DT - resistant Foxp3 + Tregs have been shown to protect against lethal autoimmunity and may thus suffice to control the SR CD4 + T cells during chronic JHMV infection ( 23 ) . It nevertheless remains intriguing that residual Foxp3 + Tregs in CLN appear to exert more potent suppressive capacities than in the CNS . In contrast to the lack of Foxp3 + Treg suppressive function within the CNS , IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice displayed increased virus and SR CD4 + T cell responses , implicating Tr1 cells as a major regulator of CNS inflammation during chronic JHMV infection . Impaired IL - 27 signaling was associated with decreased IL - 10 + virus - specific CD4 + T cells and delayed viral control ( 15 ) . The present results indeed confirmed that Tr1 cells dampened the virus - specific Th1 cell response within the CNS . However , a greater increase of SR CD4 + T cells was observed in the CNS of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice , indicating that Tr1 cells are also critical in limiting autoimmunity during chronic JHMV infection . It remains to be determined whether Tr1 cells restricting SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection are myelin - specific , as Tr1 regulatory function efficacy was shown to be dependent upon antigen specificity ( 50 , 51 ) . The mechanisms associated with Tr1 - dependent suppression of CNS SR T cells may involve IL - 10 secretion , granzyme B , and perforin production , inhibitory molecule expression , or metabolic regulation ( 52 ) . Finally , the implication of SR CD4 + T cells in promoting tissue damage and clinical autoimmunity during JHMV infection remain unclear , as increased myelin - specific CD4 + T cells in IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice correlated with a moderate decrease , rather than expected increase in demyelination ( 15 ) . It cannot be excluded that despite their increased frequency , the overall low numbers of myelin - specific CD4 + T cells are insufficient to achieve effector threshold levels required to affect myelin loss or tissue damage . Prolonged studies may be necessary to reveal altered tissue damage , as demyelination in IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice was quantified only until day 30 p . i . ( 15 ) . It also remains a possibility that compensatory mechanisms occur in the absence of Tr1 cells . IL - 10 is critical in limiting demyelination during JHMV persistence and is produced by both Foxp3 + Tregs and Tr1 cells . Surprisingly however , no difference in IL - 10 mRNA levels was detected between WT and IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice during chronic JHMV infection ( 42 ) , indicating another cell type may compensate for the lack of Tr1 cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 383}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 443}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 559}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 567}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 742, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 969}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1297, "end": 1326}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1522, "end": 1536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1639, "end": 1645}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1690, "end": 1699}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1872, "end": 1880}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 92}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 420}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 605, "end": 610}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 791}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 880}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1050}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1381}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1441, "end": 1464}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1814, "end": 1831}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 1838, "end": 1861}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
