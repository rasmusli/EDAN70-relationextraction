Etiology studies in developing countries that included viruses have identified RSV in a median of 20 % ( 5th to 95th percentile 1 to 53 ) of LRTI cases [ 30 ] and in 6 % to 96 % ( mean 39 % ) of LRTI cases with a viral etiology [ 1 ] . It should be noted that many of these studies also included measles . A recently published denominator - based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three RSV epidemics reported that 13 % of cases with LRTI were attributable to RSV infection , which was diagnosed using IF [ 31 ] . In India , RSV accounted for 17 % of hospitalized cases with LRTI in New Delhi [ 32 ] and 7 % of LRTI cases included in a 3 - year longitudinal community study in Haryana [ 28 ] . After RSV , InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study , as reported elsewhere [ 1 , 3 , 28 ] . We detected hMPV in 4 . 2 % of pneumonia cases . It is estimated that MPV worldwide accounts for 5 to 7 % of ARI in young children requiring hospitalization [ 33 ] . In India , hMPV was detected in 3 . 2 % of 662 children hospitalized for ARI over a 2 - year period from April 2005 [ 34 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 111}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 239}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 302}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 460}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 635}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 656, "end": 660}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 776}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 812}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1030, "end": 1040}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1073}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
