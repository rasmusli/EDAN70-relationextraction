{"cord_uid": "yr678u8c", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3528273", "divid": "9", "text": "The presence of DMVs in coronavirus infected cells suggested that this group of viruses might , like other positive sense RNA viruses , utilise the autophagy pathway to generate the membrane structures required for replication . Initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy [ 50 ] . Nsp8 co - localised with LC3 throughout infection and the nucleocapsid protein N co - localised with LC3 early in infection , but this decreased over time . In addition , MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 embryonic stem cell lines but virus titre was rescued in the presence of an ATG5 expressing plasmid [ 50 ] . Further work using SARS - CoV again showed co - localisation between nsp8 and LC3 [ 51 ] . However , work by others using bone marrow derived macrophages lacking ATG5 or ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 primary murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , showed that MHV replication does not require either an intact autophagy pathway or conversion of LC3I to LC3II . They did however confirm that SARS - CoV nsps co - localised with LC3 [ 52 ] . Recently , Schneider et al . demonstrated that SARS - CoV replication could also occur in ATG5 \u2212 / \u2212 MEFs , indicating no requirement for a complete autophagy pathway [ 53 ] . Interestingly , it was observed that virus replication was unaffected by the induction of autophagy in wild type MEFs [ 53 ] . Finally , de Haan et al . were unable to show co - localisation between MHV nsp8 and GFP - LC3 [ 54 ] , and Snijder et al . were unable to show co - localisation between SARS - CoV nsp3 and either endogenous LC3 or GFP - LC3A , GFP - LC3B or GFP - LC3C [ 9 ] . Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during coronavirus infection , all studies did indicate that LC3 became punctate upon coronavirus infection , suggesting an induction of autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 617}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 695, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 708}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 957}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 966}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1034, "end": 1038}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1422, "end": 1431}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1435, "end": 1445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1547, "end": 1562}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1565, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1578, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1592, "end": 1603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1745, "end": 1749}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1691, "end": 1703}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
