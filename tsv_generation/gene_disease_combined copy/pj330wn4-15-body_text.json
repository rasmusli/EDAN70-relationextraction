Raw data ( including pixel intensities and the power spectrum of the FFT ( Figure 1B ) ) from individual regions of interest can be inspected using a drop - down menu . The results report displays the mean , median and modal CBFs of the field , and a histogram of the CBF of all regions of interest ( Figure 2A ) . A color chart of the intensity of the CBF for each regions of interest is also presented in Figure 2B .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 48}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 540}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
