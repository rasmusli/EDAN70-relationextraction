A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ( PS - ON ) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [ 117 ] . The human liver - chimeric Alb - uPA / SCID mouse model also showed that PS - ON block de novo HCV infection . These data shed light on the promise of PS - ON as future clinical solution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 227}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 237}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 408}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 486}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 227}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 237}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 408}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 486}, "obj": "ne"}]}
