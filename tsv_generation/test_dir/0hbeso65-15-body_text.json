Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids , while tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic . Both drugs bind with high affinity to a family of cytoplasmic proteins ( also called immunophilin ) , which present in a variety of immune cells . Immunophilindependent signal transduction via calcineurin represents a key event in the activation of T cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes IL2 . Cyclosporine A ( CyA ) binds to cyclophilin , while tacrolimus ( Tac ) binds to FK binding proteins ( FKBPs ) . The binding blocks the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and subsequently inhibits TCR / CD3 - induced T cell proliferation by the blockage of IL2 production . Intriguingly , in addition to their promoting role in calcineurin signalling , immunophilins are catalysts of protein folding and contribute to the invasion ability of several coronaviruses [ 41 ] . As to HCV , it is well established that cyclophilins have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production . Recent data suggest that HCV replication is dependent on the interaction between cyclophilin B and nonstructural protein 5B ( NS5B , HCV RNA polymerase ) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo synthesis of positive and negative stranded RNA [ 42 ] . Given the fact that immunophilins can work as a supportive role in viral infection , it is rational to find out that CyA is capable of the anti - HCV activity through mediating a specific blockade of cyclophilins to NS5B RNA [ 43 ] . As CyA interacts with both cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B , it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV . However , there is controversy about the anti - HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo . By contrast , Tac does not have any anti - HCV activity [ 44 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 47}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 115}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 130}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 482}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 47}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 115}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 130}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 482}, "obj": "ne"}]}
