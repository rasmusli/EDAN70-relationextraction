The exact mechanism of antiviral inhibition by IFITMs remains however unclear , given that a recent study indicated that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to pore formation rather than hemifusion itself , in a cholesterol - independent manner [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 357}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 364}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 474}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 548}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
