In antiviral studies , PMOs have been covalently linked to various arginine - rich peptides , the most frequent being R 9 F 2 C ( R = L - arginine ; F = L - phenylalanine ; C = L - cysteine ) , R 5 F 2 R 4 C ( also called P4 ) , and ( RXR ) 4 XB . Conjugation is mainly at the 5 ' - terminal end of the PMO . In studies comparing the activity of various CPPs against murine hepatitis virus ( MHV ) [ 63 ] and Ebola virus ( EBOV ) [ 64 ] , arginine - rich peptides with insertions of 6 - aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vi vo effectiveness . The higher the number of arginine - 6aminohexanoic repeats , the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [ 63 ] and the protection against EBOV infection in mice [ 64 ] . These findings agree with the results from Amantana et a l . [ 57 ] , Abes et al . [ 61 ] and Youngblood et al . [ 65 ] , who also found that these residues increased serum stability and enhanced endosomal escape of the conjugates . Burrer et al . documented that the nature of the linker ( XB or cysteine ) did not affect PPMO in v itro effectiveness against MHV or cytotoxicity , although the insertion of \u03b2 - alanine residues was reported to improve both serum and intracellular stability of PPMO conjugates [ 65 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 637, "end": 642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 893}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1516, "end": 1521}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 673}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 679}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 704}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 711}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 989, "end": 994}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1381, "end": 1385}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
