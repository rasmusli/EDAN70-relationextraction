In comparison to the owned cat population , estimated at 3 . 8 million [ 26 ] , some 2 . 1 to 6 . 3 million feral cats ( free - roaming , unowned , unsocialised cats ) inhabit Australia [ 27 ] . An FPV seroprevalence of 79 % among feral cats in Victoria and NSW , documented in 1981 , provides evidence of widespread FPV exposure [ 28 ] . Viral introductions could also have been anthropogenic , for example through fomite spread during international travel .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 398}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 517}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
