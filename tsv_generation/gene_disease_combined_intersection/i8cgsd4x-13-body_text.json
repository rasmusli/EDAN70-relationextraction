Real - time RT - qPCR showed increased WNV NS1 levels ( > 4 - fold ) in cells transfected with CxCul4 compared with empty vector ( Control ) , indicating increased viral replication ( Fig 3E ) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media also showed significantly increased viral titer ( > 10 - fold ) in cells over - expressing CxCul4 compared with control cells ( Fig 3F ) . In a parallel experiment , western blots using V5 antibody was performed on total cell lysates collected from Hsu cells transfected with CxCul4 to confirm exogenous expression level of CxCul4 ( Fig 3G ) . Combined , the above data suggest that CxCul4 plays a significant pro - viral role during WNV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 104}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 141}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 303}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 587, "end": 594}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 682, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 779}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 886}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 163}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 944}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
