{"cord_uid": "21iw0bej", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5296350", "divid": "3", "text": "Human enterovirus 68 ( EV - D68 ) is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe respiratory disease and is associated with cases of paralysis , especially among children . It was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis ( Schieble et al . , 1967 ) . Over the past 10 years , EV - D68 infection outbreaks have been reported in Italy , the United States , Germany , China , and several other countries ( Esposito et al . , 2015 ; Farrell et al . , 2015 ; Reiche et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) , with a record number of confirmed cases in 2014 ( http : / / www . cdc . gov / non - polio - enterovirus / about / ev - d68 . html ) . Unfortunately , no vaccines for prevention or medicines for treatment are currently available for future outbreaks , mainly due to the fact that information on host factors required for EV - D68 replication is scarce . EV - D68 belong to enterovirus ( family Picornaviridae , genus Enterovirus ) , which are non - enveloped , positive - sense singlestrand RNA viruses of approximately 7500 nt and contain a large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved to yield corresponding viral proteins . Based on the molecular and biological characteristics , four human enterovirus ( HEV ) species are currently designated as HEV - A , - B , - C , and - D ( Oberste et al . , 1999a , b ) . The representative of HEV - A serotype is human enterovirus 71 ( EV - A71 ) , which is a primary causative agent for Hand , foot , and mouth disease ( HFMD ) that is associated with the recent outbreaks in Asia ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . EV - D68 is assigned to HEV - D serotype , but EV - D68 is unlike other enteroviruses in that it is acid labile and biologically more similar to human rhinoviruses that are associated with respiratory diseases ( Smura et al . , 2010 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 880}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1166}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1205, "end": 1220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 100}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 272}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 354}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 957}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1526, "end": 1558}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1560, "end": 1565}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1753}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1856, "end": 1877}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
