RD cells were seeded and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h in 96 - well plates . Viruscontaining supernatant was serially diluted 10 - fold , and 100 \u00b5l of diluent virus was added per well in octuplicate . Until the experimental endpoint was reached the cytopathic effect was observed once per day . According to the Reed - Muench method ( Reed , 1983 ) the viral titers of the TCID50 were determined , based on the assumption that material with 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50 / ml will produce 0 . 7 \u00d7 10 5 plaque forming units / ml ( www . protocol - online . org / biology - forums / posts / 1664 . html ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 131}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
