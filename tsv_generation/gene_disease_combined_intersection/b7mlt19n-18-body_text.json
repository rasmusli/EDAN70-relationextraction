Studies have shown that NS1 protein from Dengue virus type 2 ( DENV - 2 ) colocalizes with LC3 and that DENV - 2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection . 58 , 74 In contrast to DENV - 2 , NS1 protein from DENV - 3 displays a low level of colocalization with LC3 . 75 Sequence alignment of NS1 proteins from DENV - 2 and DENV - 3 showed that they are highly conserved . However , checking for the presence of LIR motifs revealed a discrepancy between them . We observed that DENV - 2 NS1 has an xLIR motif ( ASFIEV ) that is not recognized in any DENV - 3 NS1 sequences due to the substitution F to L , as well as an additional WxxL motif with a PSSM score 12 ( RAWNSL ) that is absent in DENV - 3 ( SL to VW ) ( Fig . S1 ) . It is possible that the absence of either the xLIR or WxxL motifs ( or both ) in DENV - 3 is responsible for its lower affinity to LC3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 175}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 430}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 655}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 673}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 723, "end": 727}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 806}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 959}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1028}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 137}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 200}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
