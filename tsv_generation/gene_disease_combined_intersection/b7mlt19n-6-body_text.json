We have used Position - Specific Iterative ( PSI ) BLAST to search against the database . 65 This search can be run against any of the viral classification systems described above . By default , the BLAST search runs against all the data available in the database with a default e - value 0 . 01 ; nevertheless , the user has the possibility to run the BLAST search against a specific category ( Baltimore classification ) or Order taxonomic rank ( ICTV classification ) , and define a different e - value . The results page displays the subject sequences from the database that match the query sequence . The LIR patterns are highlighted with red asterisks . The menus ' Bibliography ' and ' Help ' provide users with additional information . Finally , the ' Links ' menu gives access to other iLIR web resources , inducing the iLIR search tool and the iLIR Database for eukaryote model organisms . 27 , 28 Analysis of the content of the database", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 816}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1061}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
