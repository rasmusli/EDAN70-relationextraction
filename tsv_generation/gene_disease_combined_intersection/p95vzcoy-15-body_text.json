An ECO [UNK] real - time PCR machine ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) processed the reaction at the following qPCR cycling profile : 3 min incubation at 95 \u2022 C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 \u2022 C for denaturation , 30 s at 57 \u2022 C for annealing and extension , and data collection . By reading the fluorescence at 0 . 5 \u2022 C intervals between 55 \u2022 C and 95 \u2022 C , a melting curve analysis was performed after the amplification to verify the specificity of the PCR products . On each plate , a ten - folds serial dilution of purified PCR products that served as standard curves for DWV and TMV and two no - template negatives were included [ 59 ] . From the q - PCR output data , the standard curves and the experimental dilution factors viral titers respectively estimated viral copies per sample were derived [ 60 ] . To account for the exponential distribution of the data , virus titers were log - transformed and throughout the manuscript , the logarithmic values of the viral titers are reported . Because it is not possible to log transform zero values of negative samples we assigned to them a hypothetical Cq value of 36 , which was transformed to virus titers as above . From the averaged value of these \" negative titers , \" we obtained the titer detection threshold [ 61 ] . Table 1 . Primers used during qPCR for the detection and quantification of deformed wing virus ( DWV ) and minus strand - specific PCR as a proxy for viral replication as well as the DWV type - specific ( A , B , and C ) primers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 291}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 908}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1877}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1723, "end": 1732}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
