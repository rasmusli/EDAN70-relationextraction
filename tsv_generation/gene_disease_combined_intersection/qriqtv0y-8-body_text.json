Genome organization of CaKoV includes leader protein ( L ) , structural proteins ( VP0 , VP3 , VP1 ) , nonstructural proteins ( 2A , 2B , 2C , 3A , 3B , 3C , 3D ) . Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with Aichivirus A . It is noted that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania ( Fig . 3 ) . Phylogenetic analyses of 3D gene showed similar result which Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs ( G1 sub - cluster ) . This observation regarding to the sub - clusters of CaKoVs was in agreement with the previous study [ 23 ] . On the other hand , based on VP1 gene , the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups , US / EU / Africa subgroup and China / Thailand subgroup which similar to the previous reports [ 16 , 22 ] ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 265}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 303}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 924}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 454}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
