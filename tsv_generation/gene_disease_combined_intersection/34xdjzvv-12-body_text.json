Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated IL - 6 expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of IL - 6 in the muscle ( Fig . 7C ) . These chemokines downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral - induced pathogenesis , and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 329}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
