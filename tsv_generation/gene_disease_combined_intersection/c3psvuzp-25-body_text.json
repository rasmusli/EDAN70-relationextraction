However , in contrast to PARP4 , which we hypothesize is on the ' offense ' i . e . , specifically targeting viral proteins , the widely distributed pattern of positively selected sites within the macro - PARPs is reminiscent of other host immunity factors that are evolving on the ' defensive ' side ( i . e . , directly targeted by viral antagonists ) of evolutionary arms races [ 34 ] . In these cases , the host factor is performing a general antiviral function , such as shutting down host mRNA translation in the case of the antiviral protein PKR ( Protein Kinase R ) , or transducing an antiviral transcriptional program as in the case of the antiviral protein MAVS ( Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling ) . As a result of their broad action , PKR and MAVS are antagonized by an array of proteins from diverse viral lineages that interact with different regions on the proteins [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 ] . The widely distributed pattern of positive selection in PKR [ 58 ] and MAVS [ 59 ] likely reflects this ' defense ' against ( or escape from ) multiple antagonists . We postulate that the dispersed pattern of selection we observe in PARP9 , 14 and 15 similarly reflects selection to escape recognition by a variety of distinct viral antagonists of a hypothesized PARPmediated antiviral response ( see below ) , rather than selection to maintain or establish recognition of viral target proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 125}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 647}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 649, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 767}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 843, "end": 847}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1066}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1077, "end": 1082}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1369, "end": 1382}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1479, "end": 1501}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
