We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity . However , whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects , can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus . Nevertheless , the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 293}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 667}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 711}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 423}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
