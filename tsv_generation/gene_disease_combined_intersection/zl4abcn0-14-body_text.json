To initiate callus culture , the meristematic tissues of the bulb were cultured in semisolid Murashige and Skoog [ 21 ] media . Various concentrations of 2 , 4 - D alone ( 2 . 25 , 4 . 50 , 9 . 00 , 13 . 50 , 18 . 00 , and 22 . 50 M ) and also with combination of 4 . 50 M BAP and 2 . 25 , 4 . 50 , 9 . 00 , 13 . 50 , 18 . 00 , and 22 . 50 M of 2 , 4 - D were used for the initiation of callus . For each concentration , four explants were cultured on the semisolid MS medium in a single culture jar ( 59 mm \u00d7 66 mm ) . It was then repeated three times which made up to a total of 16 replicates ( 4 explants \u00d7 4 jars ) . Finally , the cultures were kept in culture room under dark condition at 25 \u00b1 2 \u2218 C . Developed callus was collected after four weeks and dried in the oven at 50 \u2218 C .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
