Human adenoviruses ( HAdVs ) are classified into 7 species ( Human mastadenovirus A to G ) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology , whole - genome sequencing , and phylogenetic analyses [ 1 ] . The prevalence of different HAdV types varies among different geographical regions [ 2 ] . HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [ 1 , 2 ] , including acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) , gastroenteritis , conjunctivitis , cystitis , and meningoencephalitis . ARI is prevalent in children , and is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population in developing countries [ 3 , 4 ] . Numerous outbreaks of ARI caused by HAdV have been reported during the last decade in many countries including China [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . The HAdV types most commonly found in respiratory samples belong to HAdV - C ( HAdV - 1 , - 2 , - 5 , - 6 ) and HAdV - B ( HAdV - 3 , - 7 ) [ 2 , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] ; however , severe or even fatal disease outbreaks are predominantly caused by only a few types ( such as HAdV - 14 , - 21 and - 55 ) [ 2 , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . The molecular typing by HAdV hexon sequences can help to accelerate the discrimination of types , resulting in timely epidemiological examinations and improved patient care [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . Several studies have shown the association between severe respiratory infections in adult and HAdV species [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ; however , reports among children with severe acute respiratory infection ( SARI ) in China are limited .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1327, "end": 1348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 517}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 523}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 543}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 560}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 571}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 577, "end": 597}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 603}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 781, "end": 785}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1571, "end": 1594}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1685, "end": 1713}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1715, "end": 1720}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
