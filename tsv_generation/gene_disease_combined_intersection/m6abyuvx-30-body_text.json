The HCV structural proteins ( core , E1 , and E2 proteins ) in the rVV - CN construct may cause the difference ; Saito et al . reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB / c mice [ 24 ] . Reportedly , CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins , but core - specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [ 21 ] . In contrast , when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB / c mice , only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia - specific CTL responses [ 25 ] . Thus , the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [ 26 ] . Based on these reports and our results , we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV - N25 treatment were as follows : 1 ) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2 ) the core protein had an immune - suppressive effect on CTL induction . Therefore , we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 264}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 282}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 746}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 768}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 936}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1291, "end": 1304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1469, "end": 1473}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
