IHC was performed on 3 - \u00b5m sections , using an automated immunostainer . For each oviduct section and sampling time scores were averaged . The antigen retrieval was performed using the commercial ready to use solution Protease 2 ( Roche , Germany ) , at 36 \u00b0 C , for 12 min . The slides were incubated with the monoclonal antibody clone 1331 ( Biodesign , USA ) targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza type A viruses applied at 1 : 1500 dilution , for 80 min at room temperature . An ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit ( Roche , Germany ) was used as detection system . A positive control consisting of a lung of an Influenza A positive chicken and a negative control consisting of a kidney of an Influenza A negative chicken were included in each run . All of the tested tissues were also incubated with the negative control antibody MG2a - 53 ( ab18415 , Abcam ) matching the primary antibody species and isotype .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 547, "end": 578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1097, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1143}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 646}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
