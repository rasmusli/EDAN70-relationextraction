Transfection of high dose 3C expression vector ( 2\u00b5g ) decreased the percentage of cells in G2 / M phase from 19 . 53 \u00b1 0 . 26 % to 13 . 19 \u00b1 0 . 48 % ( 32 . 46 % decrease ) and increased in the ratio of cells in G0 / G1 to G2 / M from 2 . 01 \u00b1 0 . 04 to 2 . 75 \u00b1 0 . 17 ( 36 . 82 % increase ; P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 4C ) . High dose 3C transfection also increased the percentage of cells in S phase ( from 41 . 10 \u00b1 0 . 48 % to 50 . 53 \u00b1 0 . 73 % ) . Although the change in the cell cycle profile was not dose - dependent , the G0 / G1 to G2 / M ratio was dose - dependent ( R = 0 . 951 ; P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 4D ) . These results suggest that the non - structural protein 3C may contribute to the enhanced cell cycle exit from G2 / M phase after EV - D68 infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 829, "end": 857}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
