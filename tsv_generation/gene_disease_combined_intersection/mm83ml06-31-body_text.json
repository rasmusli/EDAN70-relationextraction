For instance , it could be shown that Ub - ligases as well as the 26S proteasome play an important role in various steps of virus replication , e . g . , entry , maturation and latent virus reactivation [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] . Regarding the role of DUBs in HIV - 1 replication , it has been shown that the ESCRT - III interacting DUB AMSH ( associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM ) can inhibit viral particle production , while AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release [ 79 ] . Interestingly , AMSH has been reported to bind to the ESCRT - III component CHMP3 upon coexpression , which then acts as inhibitor of HIV - 1 release [ 80 ] . Recently , selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication . Some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] . However , an antiretroviral activity of DIs has been reported herein for the first time .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 370}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 684}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 737}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 864, "end": 870}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 166}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
