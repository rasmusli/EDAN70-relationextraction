In order to check whether ORF2 inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination , we checked the level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 in ORF2 expressing cells . Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG - 132 for 2 hours , I\u03baB\u03b1 was immunoprecipitated , followed by immunblotting with anti - ubiquitin antibody . Protein level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly decreased in full - length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A top panel , lane 1 and 2 ) . A similar effect ( lane 3 ) was observed following expression of a mutant ORF2 protein ( \u039435 ) with ER signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm [ 15 ] . Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody to confirm its presence ( Figure 3A , middle panel ) . A parallel set of samples were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix , immunoprecipitated with anti - ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full - length and \u039435 ORF2 protein ( Figure 3A , bottom panel ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 204}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 264}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 488}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 714, "end": 718}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 888, "end": 902}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1055, "end": 1076}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1142, "end": 1159}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
