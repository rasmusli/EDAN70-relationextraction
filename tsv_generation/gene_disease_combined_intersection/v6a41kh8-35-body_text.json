To avoid including cases of undiagnosed tuberculosis and reactive airway disease , we did not include children that had been coughing for more than 14 days and we reassessed respiratory rate in wheezers after salbutamol administration before diagnosis of pneumonia [ 20 ] . The number of measles cases in Nepal has decreased dramatically since 2003 [ 63 ] . Measles vaccination is recommended at 9 months and the vaccine coverage among those that were 9 months or older in our study area was > 90 % ( unpublished data ) . Moreover , less than 1 % of our cases had a rash and all of these were above 1 year of age . Thus , we believe that our sample consisted of children with pneumonia , and not tuberculosis , bronchial asthma , or measles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 24}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 152}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 180}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 302}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 364}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 395}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 465}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 670}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 775, "end": 785}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 795, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 827}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 832, "end": 840}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
