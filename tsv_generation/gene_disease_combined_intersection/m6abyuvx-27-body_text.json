Importantly , rVV - N25 treatment did not cause liver injury based on the serum ALT levels ; therefore , this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes . These findings provided strong evidence that rVV - N25 treatment effectively halted the progression of chronic hepatitis . Immunization with plasmid DNA or with recombinant vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with HCV infection [ 20 , 21 ] . However , findings from these previous studies revealed HCV immunization of both uninfected , na\u00efve animals and immune - tolerant animals induced a HCV - specific immune response . In the model describe here ; the animals were immune competent for HCV ; therefore , our findings provided further important evidence that rVV - N25 was effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 426}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1031}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 157}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 492}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 677}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1083}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
