The bacterial etiology is not investigated in most of the ARI - associated studies . Even in countries like the USA where pneumonia surveillance is routinely conducted , the bacterial etiology is not recorded in 65 - 85 % of hospitalized pneumonia cases [ 23 , 24 ] . It cannot be rule out that the presence of bacteria as coinfection partners with viruses may complicate the clinical symptoms of ARI illness leading to fatal outcomes . As such , the study was designed to focus not only on bacterial detection but also on antibiotic sensitivity / resistance patterns of the isolated bacterial strains .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 68}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 138}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 318}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 434}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
