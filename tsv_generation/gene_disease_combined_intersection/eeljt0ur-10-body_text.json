Fixed effects in the model were week , diet , and the interaction between . The random effects were animal nested within clinic . For vomiting , the change from week 0 to weeks 1 - 4 for each diet and between diets was tested . For diarrhea , the change from week 1 to weeks 2 - 4 for each diet and between diets was tested . The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV , C . perfringens enterotoxin gene , and FCoV antibody on vomiting and diarrhea occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive / negative and retaining the same contrasts . This same model was altered to have a response of the total vomiting occurrences over the 4 weeks and fixed effects of diet and age . Vomiting was also modeled against the initial Spec fPL values using a negative binomial model , as before , however with the change in vomiting from baseline as the interaction between . Random effects were animal nested within clinic . The same hypothesis tests were also performed comparing the change between weeks within and between diets .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 32}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 368}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 621}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 634}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
