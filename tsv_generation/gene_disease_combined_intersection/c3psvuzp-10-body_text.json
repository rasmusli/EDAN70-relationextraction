We searched publicly available primate genome sequences and identified orthologs of all 17 human PARP family members from a minimum of four hominoids , two Old World monkeys and one New World monkey . We performed a series of maximum likelihood analyses to detect recurrent positive selection for each PARP gene alignment . These analyses determine whether a model allowing positive selection at a subset of amino acid residues is a statistically better fit to the sequence data than a model that does not allow for positive selection . Using PAML software [ 40 ] , we found that five PARP genes showed highly statistically significant ( p - values , 0 . 0001 ) signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1B ) . In addition to confirming our earlier findings on PARP13 , we found that PARP4 ( also known as vPARP ) and the three macrodomain - containing PARP genes ( PARP9 / BAL1 , PARP14 / BAL2 and PARP15 / BAL3 ) all show signatures of positive selection . We followed up our PAML analyses with the more conservative PARRIS software implemented in the HyPhy package [ 41 ] , which takes into account recombination and variation in synonymous substitution rates across codons . Using PARRIS , we again found these five PARP genes to be clearly distinct from the remaining 12 as judged by likelihood ratio tests ( LRT ) allowing or disallowing positive selection ( Figure 1B ) . While our limited screen of seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0 . 01 ) for PARP4 and PARP13 , analysis of additional sequences of PARP9 , PARP14 and PARP15 met statistical significance ( see below ) . Finally , we performed branch - site analyses [ 42 ] to look for episodic signatures of positive selection on all 17 primate PARPs . We found that only PARP4 , PARP9 and PARP13 demonstrated statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection ( Figure S1 ) . This initial screen might underestimate the total number of PARP genes evolving under positive selection , firstly because our search is restricted to the primate lineage ( selection might have operated only in other mammalian lineage ) and secondly because we use only seven orthologs . Although such small alignments may lack power to detect weak selection , previous simulation studies have shown that strong selection on a subset of residues can be detected using 1 PARPs are categorized as either poly - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Poly - ) , mono - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Mono - ) or inactive based on presence of conserved motifs and , when available , data using enzymatic assays [ 4 , 6 ] . 2 PARP9 and PARP13 lack one or more catalytic residues conserved in all other PARPs and are therefore predicted to lack catalytic activity , although it is unknown whether they still bind ADP - ribose or ADP - ribosylated proteins [ 4 ] . ( B ) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection . The five PARP genes showing strong signatures of positive selection are shown in red . Shown at left are values derived from PAML indicating twice the log difference between an evolutionary model that allows positive selection ( M8 ) versus a model that disallows position selection ( M8a ) . P - values indicate whether the model that allows positive selection better fits the data . PARRIS - derived LRT ( likelihood ratio test ) values also report the difference between the log - likelihood values for a model allowing positive selection versus a model that does not . Using seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0 . 01 ) for PARP4 and PARP13 , however analysis of additional sequences of PARP9 , 14 and 15 found that these genes also met statistical significance ( see Results ) . Additional analyses are reported in Figure S1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1004403 . g001 PAML even with rather limited species surveys [ 43 ] . Given the signatures of positive selection we observed for PARP4 , 9 , 14 and 15 in this initial screen , we characterized these four genes in further detail , collecting additional orthologous sequences to examine which domains contain positively selected residues in order to create a model for how viral conflict may have driven their evolution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 143}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 794}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 959, "end": 966}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 988}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1077}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1097, "end": 1111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1217, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1375}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1383, "end": 1390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1418, "end": 1429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1611, "end": 1621}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1624, "end": 1631}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1696, "end": 1702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1706, "end": 1713}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1751, "end": 1757}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1759, "end": 1766}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1770, "end": 1777}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1939, "end": 1953}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1974, "end": 1980}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1982, "end": 1988}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1992, "end": 1999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 2156, "end": 2167}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
