{"cord_uid": "yr678u8c", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3528273", "divid": "5", "text": "The nature of membrane rearrangements has been well studied in both SARS - CoV and MHV infected cells by conventional transmission electron microscopy or by electron tomography . Both viruses have been shown to induce double membrane vesicles ( DMVs ) as well as regions of convoluted membranes [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Electron tomography data showed that the convoluted membranes in SARS - CoV infected cells were derived from and joined to the rough ER . In addition , the outer membranes of the DMVs were interlinked , studded with ribosomes and were also joined to the convoluted membranes and ER . Openings between the interior of the DMVs and the cytoplasm were not observed [ 7 ] . In contrast , ribosomes were not seen on the membranes of MHV induced structures [ 8 ] . Preliminary work presented here ( Figure 1 ) shows for the first time that IBV infection of mammalian Vero cells also results in the induction of DMVs . However , a detailed analysis of the membrane rearrangements triggered by IBV infection of mammalian and avian cells remains to be performed . The site of assembly of coronavirus RTCs is currently unclear . During the process of transcription and replication of the viral genome , both positive and negative sense RNAs are synthesised . As a result , dsRNA can form , possibly as a replicative intermediate . This dsRNA has been used as a marker for sites of viral RNA synthesis . However , in SARS - CoV infected cells , dsRNA was found to predominantly locate on the interior of DMVs while the majority of the nsps were found to locate on the convoluted membranes . High resolution immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a separation in the signals for nsps and dsRNA . In addition , due to the lack of any connecting channels between the interior of DMVs and the cytoplasm , questions were raised about transport of RNA to sites of virus assembly at the ERGIC [ 7 ] . Subsequent work using 5 - ethynyl uridine ( EU ) to label nascent RNA demonstrated a degree of co - localisation between EU and dsRNA signals at earlier time points of infection but this co - localisation was significantly reduced at later time points [ 10 ] . Therefore , further evidence is required to determine the precise location of coronavirus RTCs and the site of RNA synthesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 597}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1193, "end": 1206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1213, "end": 1246}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1278, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1341, "end": 1347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1386, "end": 1392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1449, "end": 1455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1691, "end": 1696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1700, "end": 1706}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1965, "end": 1977}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2035, "end": 2041}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
