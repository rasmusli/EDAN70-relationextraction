The clinical symptoms included respiratory disease which was mild in nature and could be diagnosed with radio imaging and computed tomography [ 54 , 56 , 59 ] and respiratory disease of severe nature showing fatal clinical symptoms requiring euthanasia [ 54 , 59 ] . Exposure to the MERS - 0 infectious clone ( icMERS - 0 ) strain in Rhesus monkeys is reported to cause respiratory disease , wherein virus antigen has been detected . Respiratory disease in such cases was found to be transient and mild in nature , which resolved by 30 days from infection . Pulmonary disease was also found to be mild upon MERS - CoV infection in NHPs . Earlier studies found ocular , intratracheal or intranasal exposure of MERS - EMC isolate to cause lethal disease . However , it has been argued that lethality was due to manipulations of marmoset , which have higher sensitivity than macaque species [ 54 , 57 ] . Cases of mild to moderate symptoms even after higher viral titer have also been reported in other studies [ 56 ] . Small animals , such as hamsters and mice , have been found to be resistant to MERS - CoV infection and development of models of severe respiratory disease has been a challenge [ 60 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 98}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 235}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 367}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 574}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 638}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 742, "end": 760}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 812}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1301}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1357}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
