{"cord_uid": "yr678u8c", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3528273", "divid": "13", "text": "In other work , it has been suggested that whilst endogenous LC3 could co - localise with MHV RTCs , GFP - LC3 showed significantly reduced co - localisation [ 56 ] . This may provide an explanation for some of the earlier experimental discrepancies . Further work in this study demonstrated that LC3 puncta were still observed in MHV infected ATG7 \u2212 / \u2212 cells , where LC3I to LC3II conversion cannot occur and also in cells expressing LC3 that cannot be processed to LC3II ( LC3 G120A ) . In addition , although the absence of the complete autophagy pathway due to a lack of ATG7 did not alter MHV replication , reduced expression of LC3 by RNAi did significantly reduce virus replication . Furthermore , viral protein expression could be rescued in the presence of LC3 G120A [ 56 ] . This demonstrated that MHV replication does not require the complete autophagy pathway , or conversion of LC3I to LC3II , in agreement with previous work , but instead required LC3I [ 52 ] . Interestingly , MHV RTCs co - localise with markers for cellular EDEMosomes [ 56 , 57 ] , vesicles involved in ER associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) tuning and knockdown of EDEMosome cargo receptor SEL1L reduced virus replication [ 57 , 58 ] . In the ERAD pathway , unfolded proteins are removed from the ER and targeted for degradation . However , under normal conditions , the ERAD machinery must be regulated to prevent premature removal of proteins before they have been folded [ 59 ] . During ERAD tuning , parts of the ERAD machinery are removed from the ER in EDEMosomes to down regulate the pathway [ 57 , 58 , 60 ] . LC3I is recruited to EDEMosomes by transmembrane protein SEL1L [ 57 ] and possibly acts as a coat protein [ 60 ] . This work has highlighted a role for LC3 as part of the ERAD tuning pathway , but not autophagy , in the replication of MHV . Whether this pathway is involved in the replication cycles of other coronaviruses remains to be determined .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 301}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 383}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 440}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 474}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 486}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 767, "end": 777}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 900, "end": 906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 963, "end": 968}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1053}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1180, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1248, "end": 1266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1549, "end": 1560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1608, "end": 1613}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1629, "end": 1640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1643, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1701, "end": 1714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1760, "end": 1764}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 94}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
