To test this , we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site - directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors . We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 \u00b5M DFMO - treated Veros . At 24 h , we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone ( no protease ) . We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B ) . Interestingly , we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity , even in DFMO - treated cells . We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 63}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 518}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 631}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 651}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 817}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 821, "end": 828}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 845, "end": 854}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 925}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 951}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 971}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
