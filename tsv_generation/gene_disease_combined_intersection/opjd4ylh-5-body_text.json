Nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) when compared to the general population , due to their exposure to the large number of smear - positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [ 3 ] . Working in a high - risk TB setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare , especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed . Health Care Workers ( HCWs ) , especially nurses , have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure , particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 92}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 112}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 198}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 295}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 395}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 616}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 678}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 762, "end": 765}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 797}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
