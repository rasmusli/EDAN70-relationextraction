In this study , we conducted a survey of CaKoV at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018 . Results : Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs ( n = 55 ) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms ( n = 252 ) . Of 307 swab samples tested by using one - step RT - PCR specific to 3D gene , we found CaKoV positivity at 17 . 59 % ( 54 / 307 ) . CaKoVs could be detected in both sick ( 19 . 44 % ) and healthy ( 9 . 09 % ) animals . In relation to age group , CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs ( 25 . 45 % ) . Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in domestic dogs . In this study , we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing ( n = 4 ) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing ( n = 8 ) . Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole genomes of Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99 . 5 % amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand . Conclusions : In conclusion , this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand . CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs . The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs . Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs . Our result raises the concerns to vet practitioners that diarrhea in dogs due to canine Kobuvirus infection should not be ignored .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 509}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 913}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 1001}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 30}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 419}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 793}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1540, "end": 1549}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1571, "end": 1591}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
