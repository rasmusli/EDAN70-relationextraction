The aliquots analyzed in Nepal were either frozen at - 70 \u00b0 C or kept at 2 to 8 \u00b0 C in the refrigerator before analysis . A separate comparative study verified that there were no substantial differences in proportion detected between the two alternative storage temperatures for up to three months ( unpublished data ) . One aliquot was immediately frozen at - 70 \u00b0 C and transported to Norway on dry ice and again stored at - 70 \u00b0 C in case there should be a need for reanalysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
