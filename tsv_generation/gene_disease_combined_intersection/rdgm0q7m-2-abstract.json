Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide ' slippery ' sequence . The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans - acting protein factor , the viral replicase subunit nsp1 [UNK] . Here we show that the the trans - activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1 [UNK] and a cellular poly ( C ) binding protein ( PCBP ) . From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrate that a PCBP / nsp1 [UNK] complex binds to a C - rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF . This is the first description of a role for a trans - acting cellular protein in PRF . The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly ( C ) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 816}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 819, "end": 823}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 903}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 980, "end": 1008}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 232}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
