Ribosome pausing at structured RNA stimulators of PRF has been widely documented and may play a mechanistic role ( 2 ) . We tested whether the nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 complex could also induce pausing by cloning the PRRSV signal ( with a defective slippery sequence ) in - frame within a reporter gene and translating in vitro derived mRNAs in the WG system . The extent of pausing was estimated by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at a bound nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 complex with that of the full - length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine , a potent inhibitor of initiation , 5 min after the start of the reaction . A control mRNA was prepared from plasmid template linearized at the position of the inserted PRRSV signal to serve as a pause marker . As can be seen in Figure 7 , pausing was clearly evident in the presence of nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 , but far less so with either protein alone , or on an mRNA lacking the C - rich region . The appearance of the pause product was transient ( albeit visible over several minutes ) , consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead - end product . In Figure 7C , further pausing assays were carried out to examine the activity of the PCBP2 KH domain mutants ( in the presence of nsp1 [UNK] ) . We found a positive correlation between the extent of pausing observed and the activity of the three mutants in specific RNA binding , namely a little for PCBP2 KH1m , close to WT levels for PCBP2 KH2m and much less pausing for PCBP2 KH3m .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 307}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 744, "end": 749}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 767, "end": 784}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 827, "end": 840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 964}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1019, "end": 1024}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1076, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1215, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1322, "end": 1346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1367, "end": 1378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1537, "end": 1548}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1573, "end": 1584}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1610, "end": 1621}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 64}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
