In fact the potential use of ultraviolet light for airborne disinfection is by no means new , and was first demonstrated more than 80 years ago 8 , 22 . As applied more recently , airborne ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) utilizes conventional germicidal UVC light in the upper part of the room , with louvers to prevent direct exposure of potentially occupied room areas 23 . This results in blocking more than 95 % of the UV radiation exiting the UVGI fixture , with substantial decrease in effectiveness 24 . By contrast , use of low - level far - UVC fixtures , which are potentially safe for human exposure , could provide the desired antimicrobial benefits without the accompanying human health concerns of conventional germicidal lamp UVGI .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 301}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
