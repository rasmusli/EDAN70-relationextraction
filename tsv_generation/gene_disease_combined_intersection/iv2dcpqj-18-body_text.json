In addition , the NS5A protein can inhibit the IRES - mediated translation through binding to the IRES located in the 5 1 - UTR . A previous study showed that the NS5A - interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis , and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription , protein degradation , protein folding and metabolism [ 26 ] . Recently , heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [ 27 ] . In this study , eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication . eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study , probably due to the different cell types ( endothelial cells vs . primary macrophages ) used to construct the cDNA library [ 26 ] . We showed that NS5A and eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm . As NS5A is the component of the replication complex , whether eEF1A is also localized in the replication complex needs further investigation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 93}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 146}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 167}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 335, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 567}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 626, "end": 632}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 724}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 924}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 928, "end": 934}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 978}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1032, "end": 1038}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1063, "end": 1083}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
