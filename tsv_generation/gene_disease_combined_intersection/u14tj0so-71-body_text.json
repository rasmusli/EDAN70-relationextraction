Since we only run Hot - Knots V2 . 0 partially to produce hotspots it does not take as long as running HotKnots and does not consume as much memory . For example , for the 400 nucleotides long RNA sequence in our data set ( A . tum . RNaseP ) , it only takes 0 . 5 seconds time and 4 MB of memory to produce the hotspots . ( The time required to get the hotspots for all RNA sequences in this data set is provided in Additional file 4 . ) We also note that since calculating hotspots and running Iterative HFold are done sequentially , the memory consumption is calculated as the maximum of the two , so the memory consumption of Iterative HFold for this sequence is still the same even including the memory needed for calculating hotspots . As we can see based on this example , even including time and memory requirements of calculating hotspots , Iterative HFold is still faster than HotKnots and uses less memory .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 676, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 713}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 841, "end": 847}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 932, "end": 941}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1040, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1097}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
