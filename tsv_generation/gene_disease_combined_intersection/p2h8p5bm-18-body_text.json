This defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes and the acidity of the stomach . They serve as an initial barrier that protects the host from infection . Once these barriers have been breached , the innate immune response relies on a set of germline - encoded receptors , known as pathogen recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , which recognize pathogen specific molecular patterns that are sensed as a danger signal by the host cell [ 95 , 96 ] . Engagement of PRRs results in the activation of several defense mechanisms including , production of interferon ( IFN ) , induction of phagocytosis , cytokines , chemokines , antimicrobial peptides , antiviral proteins , as well as activation of leukocytes and T - cells . Furthermore , the innate immune response harbors cellular components , such as dendritic cells , macrophages , and natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 97 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 402}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 446, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 588, "end": 593}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 692}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
