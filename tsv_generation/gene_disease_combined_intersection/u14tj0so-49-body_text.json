In our experiments , we choose the structure with the lowest energy value among the 20 output structures as the final structure predicted by HotKnots . When reporting prediction accuracy for HotKnots , we report the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for the average F - measure of the lowest energy structure for all RNA sequences in our data set .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 616, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 675}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
