{"cord_uid": "sxohecoi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836734", "divid": "31", "text": "This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of California , Irvine , Boston University , and the University of Alabama , Birmingham . Subjects from whom specimens were collected for study purposes provided written informed consent . Antibodies HIVIG ( IgG derived from pooled plasma of HIV - infected individuals ) and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) 2F5 , 4E10 , 2G12 , F240 , b6 , and VRC01 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program . IVIG ( Gamunex , Taleris Biotherapeutics ) was commercially acquired . mAb b12 and control mAb Den3 were provided by Dennis Burton and Brian Moldt , and control mAb Fm - 6 was a gift of Wayne Marasco ( Dana - Farber Cancer Institute ) ; b12 and the control mAbs are IgG1 . Generation and purification of dimeric and monomeric IgA2 versions of b12 ( dIgA2 b12 and mIgA2 b12 ) are described elsewhere [ 66 ] . Briefly , the IgG constant region in pDR . 12 ( IgG b12 ) was replaced with the constant region of IgA2 . IgA2 b12 was expressed in CHO - K1 cells with human J chain and purified by Protein L affinity matrix ( Pierce ) . mIgA b12 and dIgA b12 were isolated by size exclusion chromatography . IgG1 HGN194 ( a human mAb against HIV - 1 Env V3 ) , dIgA1 HGN194 , and dIgA2HGN194 were provided by Davide Corti and Antonio Lanzavecchia [ 67 ] . HGN194 variants were constructed as follows : human J chain precursor ( accession number NP _ 653247 ) , IgA1 ( allele IGHA1 * 01 , accession number J00220 ) and IgA2 ( allele IGHA2 * 01 , accession number J00221 ) constant region nucleotide sequences were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript . Constant regions were cloned into a mammalian expression vector used for subcloning of the HGN19 VH region . The HGN194 VH and VL chain were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into an IgG1 and Ig - lambda expression vector . MAbs HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains ( in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2 , the J chain expression plasmid was included ) . Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7 - 10 days of culture . HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M ( dIgA1 and dIgA2 ) or Protein A ( IgG1 ) chromatography . Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1 - specific Abs ( Southern Biotech ) . Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native - PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography . The presence of dIgA1 and dIgA2 associated J - chain was confirmed by Western blot from native and SDS - PAGE gels . Sera from 20 Zambian clade C - infected subjects ( obtained from Zdenek Hel , University of Alabama , Birmingham ) were pooled for IgG isolation using the Pierce Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Env - specific IgG , determined as for CVL and seminal fluid ( see below ) , was 0 . 98 % of total IgG . Sera from five uninfected individuals were pooled and processed for IgG isolation in the same manner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 286}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 292}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 382}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 402}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 489}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 584}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 637, "end": 656}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 725}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 746}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 800, "end": 815}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 827, "end": 831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 843}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 857}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 929, "end": 938}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 940, "end": 948}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 988}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 996}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 998, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1135}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1184, "end": 1196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1200, "end": 1210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1218, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1332, "end": 1339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1402}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T38", "span": {"begin": 1437, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T39", "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T40", "span": {"begin": 1494, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T41", "span": {"begin": 1547, "end": 1584}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T42", "span": {"begin": 1624, "end": 1634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T43", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1653}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T44", "span": {"begin": 1672, "end": 1700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T45", "span": {"begin": 1727, "end": 1733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 46, "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 326}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
