At week 6 , rZIKV - E - specific binding antibodies were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV - prME ( Figure 4b ) . Endpoint titres were determined for each animal at week 2 ( after 1 immunisation ) and week 6 ( after 2 immunisations ; Figure 4c ) . The ELISA results were confirmed by western blot analysis using RM sera from the individual vaccinated animals ( Figure 4d ) . The neutralisation activity of the antibodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluated by a PRNT 50 assay . All the vaccinated monkeys had significant neutralisation activity with anti - ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres ranging from 161 to 1380 ( average 501 \u00b1 224 standard error of the mean ; Figure 4e ) . PRNT titres did not directly correlate with ELISA titre ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 511, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 567, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 795}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 416}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
