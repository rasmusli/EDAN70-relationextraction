Examples of reference free radicals scavengers include the fluorescent natural protein R - phycoerithrin and the natural crocin , or fluorescein , which compete with the antioxidant sample for peroxyl radicals formed . These radicals may be produced through the addition of AAPH or AMVA . This is the principle of the so - called ORAC ( oxygen radical absorbance capacity ) protocol . Another example is the bleaching of \u03b2 - carotene during the autoxidation of linoleic acid or in a controlled chain reaction by using a free radical initiator : AAPH [ 29 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
