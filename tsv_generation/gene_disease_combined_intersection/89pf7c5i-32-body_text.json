Dermal abnormalities include nodules , ulcerations or more rarely exfoliative dermatitis . They are generalized or localized , symmetrical or asymmetric and may , though less frequently , appear all over the body in a focal , multifocal , regional or diffuse pattern [ 12 - 14 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 62 , 64 , 68 , 70 ] . Some cats may harbour different types of skin lesions at the same time or develop them subsequently ; they may coexist with mucocutaneous lesions ( Fig . 3 ) . Cutaneous and mucocutaneous nodules , of variable size , are more often localized on the head , including eyelids , nose and lips , or on the distal parts of the limbs . Nodules have Ulcerations which may be diffuse and superficial or focal and deep ( Fig . 4 ) are localized on the same body sites as nodules , and may be complicated by bacterial infections that explain why they are covered by hemorrhagic crusts and / or purulent material [ 13 , 14 , 52 , 53 , 56 , 58 , 60 - 62 , 64 , 65 , 68 , 70 ] . However , ulcerative dermatitis is sometimes diffuse and can be observed on the body trunk or on bony prominences [ 14 , 36 , 58 , 62 , 63 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 104}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 134}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 172}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 478}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 620}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 767, "end": 779}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 894}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 943}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 980, "end": 992}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1122}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
