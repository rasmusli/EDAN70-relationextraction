LIV is most commonly known as pathogen of sheep and red grouse although humans can also get infected [ 17 , 56 ] . Animals develop a febrile disease , which can progress to fatal encephalitis [ 57 ] . Like TBEV , the vector of LIV is the tick species Ixodes ricinus [ 57 ] . Ticks transmit the virus to animals , however , natural exposure to humans is rare [ 33 ] . Instead humans that are exposed to infected animals such as veterinarians , farmers , butchers , and abattoir workers , as well as laboratory scientists have acquired LIV infection [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] . In between the years of 1934 and 1991 , 31 human cases of LIV was described [ 62 ] . In humans , LIV causes a disease that closely resembles TBEV , with initial flu - like symptoms which can progress to severe neurological disease . Distinct but closely related viruses are also found in Spain ( Spanish sheep encephalomyelitis virus ) , Turkey ( Turkish sheep encephalitis virus ) , and Greece ( Greek goat encephalitis virus ) [ 33 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 686, "end": 690}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 876}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 940, "end": 961}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1034, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1104}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1133, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
