As for IFN - s , which are important mucosal antiviral factors produced by respiratory epithelial cells , we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level , confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium , which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract . This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on NEC and by the observed induction of SOCS1 , a potent negative regulator of the IFN pathway and consequently also of the expression of IFN - stimulated genes ( 61 ) . This is in accordance with a report describing SOCS1 induction during JEV infection ( 36 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 263}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 394}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 878}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 929, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 60}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 798}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1035}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T11", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
