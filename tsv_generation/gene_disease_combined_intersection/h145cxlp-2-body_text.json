B ) and between patients infected with different influenza A subtypes showed only small differences when controlling for age [ 9 , 10 ] . During the pandemic , however , some studies observed increased morbidity and mortality among children compared to previous seasonal influenza [ 6 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] , while other studies described the clinical features of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 as being similar or even milder [ 14 , 15 ] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and fatal viral pneumonia was observed more frequently during the pandemic [ 16 ] . Post - pandemic surveillance was recommended , as circulation of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 was expected to continue for several years , gradually assuming a seasonal influenza pattern [ 16 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 535, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 155}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 634}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 641}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 653, "end": 669}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
