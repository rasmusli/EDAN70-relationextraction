Epidemiology supports a relationship of KD to an infectious disease . Several pathological mechanisms are being considered , including a superantigen response , direct invasion by an infectious etiology or an autoimmune phenomenon . Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin is effective at reducing the rates of coronary aneurysms . However , the role of B cells and antibodies in KD pathogenesis remains unclear . Murine models are not clear on the role for B cells and antibodies in pathogenesis . Studies on rare aneurysm specimens reveal plasma cell infiltrates . Antibodies generated from these aneurysmal plasma cell infiltrates showed cross - reaction to intracellular inclusions in the bronchial epithelium of a number of pathologic specimens from children with KD . These antibodies have not defined an etiology . Notably , a number of autoantibody responses have been reported in children with KD . Recent studies show acute B cell responses are similar in children with KD compared to children with infections , lending further support of an infectious disease cause of KD . Here , we will review and discuss the inconsistencies in the literature in relation to B cell responses , specific antibodies , and a potential role for humoral immunity in KD pathogenesis or diagnosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1333, "end": 1353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 33}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 38}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 86}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 472}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 525}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 666}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 914}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1045, "end": 1048}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1125}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1194, "end": 1205}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1225}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1400, "end": 1403}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
