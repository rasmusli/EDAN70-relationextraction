Plots of the day - byday quantiles of the filtered radiograph counts attributable to an anthrax attack , based on 500 simulated anthrax outbreaks . The filtering operation , as defined by ( 3 ) , is based on the first ten months of training data from Akron , in combination with one of four filters ( 1 - day , 7 - day , linear and exponential ) . Each filtered signal is scaled by \u03c4 k , 0 . 03 , calculated using a normal approximation , for comparisons to be made across filters . The biases in the specificity Figure 6 The biases in the specificity . A plot of the actual specificity ( the specificity calculated using the training data ) minus the nominal specificity ( 1 - \u03b1 ) for different values of \u03b1 . The value of the detection threshold \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , was calculated using a normal approximation .
