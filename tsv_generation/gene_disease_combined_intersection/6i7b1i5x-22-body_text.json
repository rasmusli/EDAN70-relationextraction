Cytokines , such as IFN - \u03b3 , IL - 1 and TNF , that would be present during generalized inflammation , facilitate a pathological anti - endothelial response of circulating IgG and IgM antibodies associated with acute KD [ 125 , 126 ] . In cell lysis assays , pathogenesis was eliminated by clearing the serum through anti - IgG and anti - IgM sepharose columns supportive of no role of peripheral anti - IgA responses . This does not eliminate the potential role of intra - tissue IgA + plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated [ 83 , 102 ] . Other studies support significant IgM mediated cytotoxicity against endothelial cells in KD patients [ 127 ] . Prevalent IgM anti - endothelial responses in KD have also been shown without cytokine stimulation [ 127 , 128 ] . In a mouse model system , anti - endothelial antibody responses were replicated , but these did not demonstrate cardiac vascular involvement [ 129 ] . The case report of anti - B cell monoclonal antibody success was proposed by the authors to be due to the downregulation of such an anti - endothelial invasive effect [ 63 ] . Although intriguing , it remains unknown if these anti - endothelial responses actually contribute to the vasculitis in KD and other vasculitides [ 123 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 148}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 706}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 866}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 939}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 3, "end": 6}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 323}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 760}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 828}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1006, "end": 1035}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1327, "end": 1338}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1341, "end": 1344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1354, "end": 1367}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
