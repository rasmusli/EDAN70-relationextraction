Although the preference of APN for neutral amino acid residues at the P1 position has been generally established , little is known about the physical basis for this preference and even less is known about the downstream prime - side specificity of APN . In this study , we performed a comprehensive evaluation of APN substrate specificity and identified key structural features that dictate the specificity of the protease . Using an unbiased mass spectrometry - based peptide library assay , we determined the P1 - P4 \u2032 substrate preferences of APN and prioritized candidate peptide substrates in the library for rational inhibitor design . Six crystal structures of APN complexed with different amino acids in the P1 position were solved and provided a structural basis for the P1 substrate specificity . From these crystal structures , a peptide was modelled into the specificity pocket to highlight key interactions responsible for dictating the extended prime - side substrate specificity . Using a substrate derived from the peptide library , we developed a novel substrate - based cyclic peptide inhibitor that was specific for APN . Our inhibitor specifically bound to APN - expressing prostate cancer cell lines in vitro , decreasing their clonogenic survival , and was an effective therapeutic , leading to decreased tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models of prostate cancer .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 438}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 535, "end": 544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 632, "end": 640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 904}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1315, "end": 1331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1448, "end": 1454}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1492, "end": 1508}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
