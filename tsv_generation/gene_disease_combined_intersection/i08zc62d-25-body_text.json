The first crystal structure of sialidase with a geranylated flavonoid provides structural insights into the binding mode of natural flavonoid - based inhibitors at atomic resolution . The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors . Firstly , the 3 0 - hydroxyl group stabilizes the enzyme - inhibitor complex through hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Ala292 . Secondly , additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe353 , Trp354 and Tyr587 in the active site . Importantly , in the four variants of human sialidase this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group . Glu111 , Tyr179 and Tyr181 of human Neu2 are not conserved in bacterial and viral sialidases and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses ( Burmeister et al . , 1993 ) . However , our biochemical and structural data suggest that the hydrophobic binding pocket of Cp - NanI which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus human sialidases . Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 179}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 778}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 890}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1055}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1076, "end": 1107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1305, "end": 1332}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1335, "end": 1345}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1468, "end": 1485}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
