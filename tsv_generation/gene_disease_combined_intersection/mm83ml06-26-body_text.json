To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) and syngag expression plasmids , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs . The [UNK] PTAP mutant , which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment , cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis . After immunoprecipitation with Gag - specific antibodies , western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 ) . Following co - expression of syngag wt and HA - Ub , a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed , which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag . Upon treatment with 14 \u00b5M PR - 619 or 20 \u00b5M P22077 , the intensity of the HA - Ub - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels of the [UNK] PTAP mutant . Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti - CA staining . Thus , treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 977}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1043}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1119, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1250, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1328, "end": 1335}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1338, "end": 1347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1382}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
