A luciferase reporter construct driven by IFN - \u03b2 promoter was used to reflect IFN - \u03b2 promoter activity stimulated during infection . Sendai virus was used as a model virus to potently induce IFN expression in transfected cells . When increasing doses of M proteins were expressed in advance , a dose - dependent inhibition of IFN - \u03b2 promoter activity was observed ( Figure 1B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) . A similar observation was also noted when synthetic dsRNA analog poly ( I : C ) was used as an alternative inducer that specifically stimulates the RLR pathway of IFN production ( Figure 1C ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) . These two pieces of data are generally consistent with a previous report , 22 and they further strengthen the current model of the IFN antagonism of MERS - CoV M protein .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 41}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 61}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 84}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 245, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 749}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 940, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
