This new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure [ 1 ] . To date , the MERS - CoV still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [ 2 , 3 ] . Epidemiological data suggest that the MERS - CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia , which accounts for the majority of primary community - acquired cases . Many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels , the primary animal reservoir of MERS - CoV . Alternatively , camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [ 4 , 5 ] . Other outbreaks of MERS have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Most of the MERS - CoV infections occur within the Arabian Peninsula , i . e . , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and United Arab Emirates , however MERS cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [ 9 , 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 37}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 164}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 285}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 303}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 500}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 693}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 741}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 924}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1163}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
