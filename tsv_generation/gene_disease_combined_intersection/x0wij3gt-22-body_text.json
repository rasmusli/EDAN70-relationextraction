{"cord_uid": "x0wij3gt", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4699375", "divid": "22", "text": "Specific mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) cascades control the activation of fos and jun family protooncogenes and their protein products ( c - Jun and c - Fos ) are known as the AP - 1 family members . These \" early response protooncogene \" products dimerize to form the AP - 1 transcription factor , a converging point that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , transformation , inflammation , pulmonary defense , and autoregulation of AP - 1 gene transcription [ 46 ] . Early studies [ 47 , 48 ] suggested that c - Jun had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of lung cancers because it was highly expressed in 31 - 50 % of patients with nonsmall cell cancers , and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium . One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant - negative c - Jun mutant TAM67 in lung epithelial cells decreased tumor number and overall lung tumor burden in chemically induced mouse lung tumor models [ 49 ] . c - Jun is an important transcriptional activator of PDK1 . Notably , expression of PDK1 is sufficient to restore tumor growth after c - Jun knockdown in melanoma cells , suggesting that PDK1 is an important mediator of c - Jun oncogenic activities [ 50 ] . Consistent with this , we found that PGE 2 increased the expression of c - Jun and exogenous overexpression of c - Jun enhanced bronchial epithelial cells proliferation and expression of PDK1 , whereas inhibition by PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA caused inhibitions of cell growth and expression of PDK1 . This suggests that c - Jun is an upstream regulator of PDK1 signaling . Induction of c - Jun by PGE 2 regulates the expression and activation of PDK1 and cell growth . It indicated c - Jun might play an important role in the potential mechanism of abnormal cell proliferation in brochial epithelial cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 149}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 212}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 580}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 915}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1048, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1101, "end": 1106}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1132, "end": 1137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1181, "end": 1189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1235, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1268, "end": 1276}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1377, "end": 1385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1417, "end": 1425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1493, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1522, "end": 1527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1598, "end": 1603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1624, "end": 1632}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1660, "end": 1665}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1690, "end": 1698}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1750, "end": 1755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1786, "end": 1794}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 643}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 956}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 986}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 32, "span": {"begin": 1021, "end": 1032}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 33, "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 34, "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 29, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
