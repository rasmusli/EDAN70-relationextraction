Two hypergeometric tests have been conducted to compare the enrichment fold of LIRCPs in viruses against the host : one for proteins containing all combination of LIR patterns ( i . e . , either xLIR or WxxL , or both kind ) and another considering only the proteins containing at least one xLIR motif ( i . e . , xLIR patterns alone or along with one or more WxxL patterns ) . We observed that when all the possible combinations of LIR patterns are taken into account , there is an enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses compared with the host organism for all 4 model organisms tested . However , there is an enrichment of xLIR patterns in the host compared with the infecting viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 71}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 161}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 471}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 565}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 577, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 637}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 709}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 780}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 908}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
