For bacterial expression , the NanI catalytic domain without the lectin domain ( NanI CD ; residues 243 - 694 ) was amplified from C . perfringens genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET - 23d expression vector ( Novagen ) , which contains a direct C - terminal hexahistidine ( His 6 ) tag . Cp - NanI CD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus ( DE3 ) cells . The transformed cells were cultured in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium containing 100 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K . The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( Pharmacia ) at an OD 600 of 0 . 6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min . The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM - mercaptoethanol ) and lysed by sonication , after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h . The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal - affinity chromatography on nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid resin ( Peptron ) pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole ) . The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer . The His 6 - tag fused protein bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 300 mM imidazole ) . The samples were then purified by size - exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 column ( GE Healthcare Life Science ) preequilibra with gel - filtration buffer ( 25 mM CHES - HCl pH 9 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl ) , after which the fractions containing Cp - NanI CD protein were collected . The protein was concentrated to 21 . 8 mg ml \u00c01 using an Amicon Ultra - 15 30K ( Millipore ) and was stored at 193 K .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 163}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 189}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1432, "end": 1458}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
