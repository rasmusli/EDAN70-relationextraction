In eukaryotic cells , polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription , translation , and DNA replication , and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation . Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood . Picornaviruses , including Coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) , are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo ; however , precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described . Here , we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine - depleted conditions . We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases , and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion . Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity , we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity . We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine - depleted conditions . Finally , we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine - depleted cells . In sum , our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection . Further , these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine - depleting antiviral therapies . Viral proteases play many roles during infection , and picornaviruses encode two distinct proteases : 2A ( 2A pro ) and 3C ( 3C pro ) . The 2A and 3C picornaviral proteases function to cleave both host and viral proteins . 3C is responsible for the majority of viral polyprotein cleavage . Importantly , 3C also functions as part of 3CD ( a polyprotein consisting of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase ) and acts as a protease in this context as well [ 11 ] . To date , reports demonstrated that 2A facilitates the cleavage between the P1 and P2 protein segments [ 12 ] . The precise regulation of these proteases , their activities , and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood . However , due to their copious functions during infection , they represent potential drug targets [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 780}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 822}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 890}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 917, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 984, "end": 993}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1032, "end": 1051}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1078, "end": 1087}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1192, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1316, "end": 1325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1524, "end": 1540}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1614, "end": 1624}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1626, "end": 1629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1631, "end": 1638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1644, "end": 1647}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1649, "end": 1656}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1674, "end": 1697}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1730, "end": 1745}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1747, "end": 1750}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1791, "end": 1803}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1828, "end": 1831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1857, "end": 1861}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1865, "end": 1877}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1895, "end": 1907}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1911, "end": 1925}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1941, "end": 1950}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 2019, "end": 2022}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2059, "end": 2086}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 2127, "end": 2137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 439}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 469}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 32, "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 604}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 33, "span": {"begin": 1341, "end": 1354}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
