The expression of one of these antiviral proteins , the Mx GTPase , is known to be directly stimulated by type I IFN and can be used as marker for the induction of intracellular antiviral mechanisms by these cytokines in cats as well as in other species [ 19 , 64 ] . Thus , as detection of feline type I IFN on a protein level is rendered difficult by the unavailability of antibodies specifically recognizing these proteins , mRNA levels of Mx were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216 , as indication for production of type I IFN . Transcription of Mx was significantly enhanced and remained proportional to mRNA expression of type I IFN in stimulated PBMCs of individual cats ( Figure 4A", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 204}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 540}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 707}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 729}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 815}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
