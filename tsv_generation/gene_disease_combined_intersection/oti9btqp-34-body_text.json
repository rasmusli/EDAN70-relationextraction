The mice were challenge with either 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU or 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU ZIKV - PR209 virus on day 15 ( single immunisation group ) or day 21 one week after the second immunisation ( two immunisation groups ) . Post challenge , the animals were weighed and body temperature was measured daily by a subcutaneously located temperature chip . In addition , they were observed for clinical signs of disease twice daily ( decreased mobility ; hunched posture ; hind - limb knuckle walking ( partial paralysis ) , paralysis of one hind limb or both hind limbs ) and blood was drawn for viral load determination . The criteria for killing on welfare grounds consisted of 20 % weight loss or paralysis in one or both hind limbs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 600}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 681, "end": 708}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 842, "end": 854}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 867}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
