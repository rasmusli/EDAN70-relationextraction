{"cord_uid": "v6a41kh8", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2727531", "divid": "37", "text": "We observed a large month - to - month variation in the proportion of CAP cases from whom we identified a res - piratory RNA virus , largely reflecting the epidemic pattern of viral infections in this sub - tropical setting . A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel . Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [ 64 ] . Atypical bacteria , like Mycoplasma pneumoniae , cause pneumonia more frequently in school - age children , but can also cause mild infections in younger children [ 65 ] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia . However , nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy , young children [ 66 ] . Moreover , their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [ 67 ] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings . S . pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus - associated pneumonia in children in hospital , especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [ 68 ] . The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 ( Figure 2 ) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B ( Figure 3 ) . There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [ 69 ] . Additionally , we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral - bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection . Again , quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 414}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 510}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 642}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 668}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 709, "end": 729}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 862, "end": 872}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1202}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1253, "end": 1263}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1267, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1392, "end": 1396}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1490, "end": 1502}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1604, "end": 1625}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1762, "end": 1790}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1793, "end": 1803}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1862, "end": 1896}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 2084, "end": 2094}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
