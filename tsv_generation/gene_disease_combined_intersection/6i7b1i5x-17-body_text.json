{"cord_uid": "6i7b1i5x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6514959", "divid": "17", "text": "The study that created antibodies A and J described a total of 44 heavy chain sequences and 61 light chain sequences . Other antibodies expressed , D and L , and showed no binding to ICIs . There was generally a lack of oligoclonal response with just six light chains duplicated and only the J heavy ( 3 times ) and three other heavy chains duplicated . As these antibodies were created with non - native heavy and light chain pairings , they may have non - specific interactions [ 108 ] . This is one of the major challenges in the burgeoning bispecific antibody field [ 109 ] . Evidence of in situ maturation of antibodies , such as A and J , also does not preclude such an antibody targeting a self - antigen . Notably , two other rare clones ( only one transcript each from the 44 sequence reads ) showed weak binding to the same spheroid ICIs . One of these weak binding antibodies ( antibody E ) also bound plasma cells directly and was subsequently shown to bind kappa chains of IG . This highlights the non - specific autoimmune potential of antibodies from these types of pathologic infiltrates , which will be reviewed later .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 88}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 156}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 188}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 300}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 341}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 427}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 637}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 643}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 887}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 900}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 970, "end": 983}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1050, "end": 1061}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
