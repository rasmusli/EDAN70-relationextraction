They may present antibacterial , antifungal , antiparasitic , and antiviral activities , and are increasingly of interest as alternatives to classic antibiotics [ 88 ] . AMPs such as lactoferrin , cecropin , defensin , plectasin and bacteriocins showed beneficial effects on growth performance , nutrient digestibility , small intestinal morphology and gut microbiota in pigs [ 89 ] . Available data on the effect of AMPs on swine health and especially in the control of PWD have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 89 , 139 ] . Antimicrobial lactoferrin peptides are one of the most commonly used AMPs in pig feeds . More recently , it was shown in a murine model of intestinal inflammation that treatment with porcine lactoferrinderived peptide LFP - 20 was effective in the prevention of histological damage , the inflammatory response and the disruption of tight junction structure induced by LPS in the intestine [ 140 ] . Colicins , a class of bacteriocins produced by E . coli and closely related species , have been shown to inhibit the activities of ETEC : F4 and F18 strains in vitro and in vivo , and improve the growth performance , reduce the incidence of PWD and the expression of the IL - 1\u03b2 and TNF - \u03b2 genes in ileal tissues of pigs [ 141 ] . On the other hand , resistance to AMPs has been observed in vitro in GNB such as E . coli [ 142 ] . Thus , the use of AMPs in pig farms needs careful and controlled implementation to limit possible resistance development and cocktails of AMPs might be useful to mitigate selection for resistance [ 88 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1314, "end": 1340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 588}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 807}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1284, "end": 1288}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1448}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
