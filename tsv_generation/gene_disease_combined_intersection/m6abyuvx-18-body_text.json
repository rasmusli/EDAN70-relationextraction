The ratio of CD8 + CD107a + cells to all CD8 T cells significantly increased in rVV - N25 - treated splenocytes after co - culture with EL - 4CN2 or EL - 4NS2 ( P , 0 . 05 ) , whereas splenocytes that had been treated with any other rVV were not detected ( Figure 5A , B and C ) . These results indicated that rVV - N25 treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2specific activated CD8 T cells . Consistent with these results , the ratio of CD8 + IFN - c + cells to all CD8 T cells for rVV - N25 - treated mice was also significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Taken together , these findings indicated that rVV - N25 induced an effective CD8 T - cell immune response and that NS2 is an important epitope for CD8 T cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 813, "end": 817}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 841}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
