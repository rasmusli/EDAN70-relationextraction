In the double antigen sandwich immunoassay , the HCV antigen labelled with colloidal gold is a soluble recombinant antigen . During the test , HCV antibodies in the sample react with antigen coated on the nitrocellucose membrane and gold - HCV antigen conjugates , forming a gold - conjugated Ag - Ab - Ag sandwich complex . At the same time , we carried out a series of experiments to optimize different parameters , such as the amount of immunoreagents , the type of materials , and the composition of the blocking solution and detector reagent mixture . The experimental results demon - strated that the chromatographic strip device we constructed is simple , sensitive and specific . It is an ideal test for the screening of patients with HCV infection . The presence of recombinant core and NS3 antigens in the strip may be crucial for the detection of HCV - infected patients with low antibody titers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 176}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 438}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 890, "end": 924}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 872}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 979}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
