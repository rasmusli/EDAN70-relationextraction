However , and some years earlier , some authors had already reported that tea tree oil ( Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel . ) , mainly its major component ( terpinen - 4 - ol ) , was able to suppress the production in vitro of TNF - \u03b1 and IL - 1\u03b2 , as well as IL - 8 , IL - 10 and PGE 2 by LPS - activated human blood monocytes [ 106 ] . Six years later , Caldefie et al . ( 2006 ) [ 107 ] also reported the capacity of the essential oil of that species for suppressing IL - 2 pro - inflammatory cytokine and stimulating the secretion of the anti - inflammatory IL - 4 and IL - 10 cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( monocytes and lymphocytes ) stimulated by the lectin phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) from Phaseolus vulgaris L . . Also using PHA from Phaseolus vulgaris for stimulating mononuclear cells , Hammer et al . ( 2000 ) [ 108 ] reported that the essential oils of Taxandria fragrans ( J . R . Wheller & N . G . Marchant ) J . R . Wheeler & N . G . Marchant , comb . nov . , mainly constituted by 1 , 8 - cineole , \u03b1 - pinene and linalool , decreased the production of the cytokines TNF - \u03b1 and IL - 6 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 200}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 532}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 552}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 954, "end": 973}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1022, "end": 1026}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1372, "end": 1380}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1384, "end": 1391}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
