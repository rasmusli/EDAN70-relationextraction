Five serum proteins with the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases , as verified using western blotting . apolipoprotein L1 ( 16 , 17 ) . These latter five markers of fibrosis are secreted in the blood and show consistent changes with the increasing stage of fibrosis when compared with the markers used in the FibroTest and enhanced liver fibrosis ( ELF ) , Hepascore and FIBROSpect tests . In the present study , the levels of apolipoprotein J precursor decreased in the progression of HBV from CHB to ACLF . Therefore , further studies , with a larger number of samples , are required in order to better establish the role of apolipoprotein J precursor as a potential biomarker for HBV progression .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 98}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 206, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 724}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 897, "end": 924}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 335}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 536}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 617}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 760}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 769}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 777}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 957}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
