{"cord_uid": "54lx7cl3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4801059", "divid": "18", "text": "Although there is substantial evidence that viral infection influences the URT bacterial community , whether these changes are reflected in the LRT and ultimately in pneumonia etiology is unclear , which weakens our first hypothesis ( i . e . respiratory viruses can influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial carriage structure in the URT ) . Studies that examine the joint effects of viral coinfection , bacterial carriage and bacterial pneumonia would provide one strategy for filling this gap . However , we found only two such studies . In a South African hospital - based surveillance study of severe acute respiratory illness , 969 nasopharyngeal - oropharyngeal specimens were tested for S . pneumoniae and a panel of respiratory viruses . A high pneumococcal colonization density in the nasopharynx and oropharynx was associated with both respiratory virus co - infection and pneumococcal pneumonia [ 86 ] . A second hospital - based casecontrol study compared nasopharyngeal carriage among 274 radiologically confirmed cases of pneumonia , 276 cases of other LRT infections and 350 controls in Vietnam . Their findings for S . pneumoniae were similar to that of the South African study . However , the investigators also studied H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis and found no clear association between viral co - infection , nasopharyngeal bacterial load and pneumonia for these species [ 87 ] . As noted above , M . catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia , but H . influenzae is second only to S . pneumoniae . Although there appears to be a persuasive argument for a link between viral co - infection , carriage and pneumonia for S . pneumoniae , whether or why the interaction is not true for other URT bacteria needs further exploration . In particular , studies that can directly test whether viral infection led to bacterial colonization or overgrowth by a potential pathogen , which led to bacterial pneumonia by that pathogen , are in order . In conclusion , there is no definitive answer to our first hypothesis . Epidemiologic studies and experiments indicate viruses alter the bacterial community in the URT , but they do not yet adequately address whether these changes in the URT bacterial community play a significant role in pneumonia etiology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 176}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 303}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 431}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 464}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 648}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 896}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 900, "end": 923}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1084, "end": 1099}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1385, "end": 1395}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1469, "end": 1479}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1641, "end": 1651}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1920, "end": 1940}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 2263, "end": 2273}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
