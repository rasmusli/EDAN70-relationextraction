{"cord_uid": "sxohecoi", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836734", "divid": "21", "text": "Female genital tract secretions are often acidic , and the secretions of HIV - infected individuals have antibody capable of coating virus contained in those secretions . These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV - 1 across epithelial cells . Our primary finding is that at acidic pH , IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV - 1 clinical isolates , including transmitted / founder Env - pseudotyped strains . Moreover , antibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH . The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking down FcRn , which is known to bind IgG and immune complexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH [ 24 , 42 ] . We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious . Although neutralizing antibodies generally promote more transcytosis , the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediated by non - neutralizing antibodies . Finally , we demonstrate abundant FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra , suggesting that these sites could play a major role in FcRn - mediated immune complex transcytosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 466}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 654}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 675}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 891}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1027, "end": 1057}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1093, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 77}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
