While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance chymotrypsin activity [ 32 , 33 ] , a role for polyamines in viral protease activity has never been reported . Toward this end , we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines . Following incubation with a drug , cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h , at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis . Lysates were analyzed for the presence of cleaved eIF4G , a cellular target of the viral proteases . We observed that in infected cells , a distinct eIF4G band was present ; however , in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm , eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A ) . We were unable to visualize full - length eIF4G , likely due to its large size .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 166}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 292}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 355}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 699}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 742}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 873, "end": 879}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 981}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
