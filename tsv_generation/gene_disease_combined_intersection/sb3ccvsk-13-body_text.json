Transfer of Foxp3 + Tregs during acute JHMV infection limited CNS tissue damage by inhibiting T cell proliferation within CLN and reducing overall T cell numbers within the CNS , yet without affecting frequencies of virus - specific T cells ( 20 ) . These studies predicted that Foxp3 + Treg depletion during chronic JHMV infection would increase T cell numbers in CLN and CNS . DT - treated DTR + mice indeed exhibited a threefold increase in CLN cellularity compared to DTR \u2212 controls between days 21 and 28 p . i . ( Figure 2A ) . However , overall CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proportions were not altered suggesting the cellular increase was not lymphocyte specific ( Figure 2B ) . Analysis of T cell activation following Treg depletion revealed a significant increase in CD62L low CD44 hi populations in both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subset ( Figure 2C ) . Contrasting increased activation in CLN , DTR \u2212 and DTR + mice showed no difference in total numbers of splenocytes 1 week after DT treatment ( data not shown ) , suggesting specific regulation in CLN .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 934, "end": 939}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 984, "end": 990}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 267}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 286}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 545}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
