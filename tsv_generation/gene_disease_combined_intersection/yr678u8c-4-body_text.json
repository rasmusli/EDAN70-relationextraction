{"cord_uid": "yr678u8c", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3528273", "divid": "4", "text": "Following attachment of coronavirus particles to virus specific receptors on the host cell and uptake of the virus into the cytoplasm , viral genomic RNA is released . This genomic RNA is recognised directly by the host cell translation machinery and two large polyproteins , pp1a and pp1ab , of approximately 400 and 800 kDa are translated . The two polyproteins encode the 15 ( IBV ) or 16 ( all other coronaviruses ) non - structural proteins ( nsps ) , which are generated by co - or post - translational cleavage by virally encoded proteases . These proteins assemble into viral replication - transcription complexes ( RTCs ) , providing the virus with the enzymes required for viral RNA transcription and replication , as well as proof - reading and capping of new viral transcripts [ 1 ] . In addition , expression of the nsps triggers the rearrangement of host cell membranes , presumed to provide a platform for the assembly of RTCs . It is likely that expression of the membrane associated nsps 3 , 4 and 6 is responsible for inducing these rearrangements . Data from closely related arterivirus , equine arterivirus ( EAV ) , demonstrated that expression of nsps 2 and 3 ( homologues of nsps 3 and 4 in coronaviruses ) , in the absence of other viral proteins , was sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements and mutation of nsp3 blocked this function [ 2 , 3 ] . Non - structural protein 4 from MHV is known to play a role in formation of rearranged membranes because viruses containing mutant nsp4s show defects in membrane rearrangements and a reduction in virus replication [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , co - expression of nsp4 with the C - terminus of nsp3 from MHV resulted in the relocation of both proteins from diffuse in the cytoplasm to punctate [ 6 ] . The authors hypothesised that interaction between these proteins may result in the rearrangement of host membranes [ 6 ] . However , the precise mechanism by which the nsps induce membrane rearrangements remains to be elucidated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 185}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 291}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 446}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 829, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 942}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 980, "end": 1017}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1169, "end": 1182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1349, "end": 1354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1388, "end": 1415}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1647, "end": 1652}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1661, "end": 1674}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1677, "end": 1682}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1953, "end": 1958}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1094, "end": 1106}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
