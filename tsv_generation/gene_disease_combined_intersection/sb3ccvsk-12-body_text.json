JHMV - infected DEREG mice ( DTR + ) and their control littermates ( DTR \u2212 ) were treated daily with DT at the peak of SR CD4 + T cell response between days 21 and 28 p . i . ( 13 ) . Foxp3 + Treg frequencies were 70 % reduced at day 28 p . i . in both CLN and CNS of DTR + mice ( Figures 1C , D ) . By contrast , control DTR \u2212 treated mice revealed no alteration of Foxp3 + T cell frequencies in CLN and CNS after DT treatment ( Figures 1C , D ) . These results confirmed the specificity of DT - mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion as well as their residual presence due to incomplete abrogation and rebound after ongoing DT treatment ( 23 , 28 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 430}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 752}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 101}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
