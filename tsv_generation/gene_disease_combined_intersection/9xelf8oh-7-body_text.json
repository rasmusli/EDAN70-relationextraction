SQPV infection status was initially determined using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Scott and Keymer 1981 ) , but more recently conventional PCR ) and qPCR ( Atkin et al . 2010 ; Fiegna et al . 2016 ) assays have been developed . As grey squirrels appear asymptomatic , lower infection loads are recorded , and thus it is essential to use the more sensitive qPCR assays when screening for SQPV presence as part of a wildlife disease management programme for red squirrels . For SADV infection , confirmation has relied on either TEM ( Everest et al . 2008 ) or conventional qualitative PCR assays ( Everest et al . 2009b ) . No assay for either pathogen has incorporated an IC ( either exogenous or endogenous ) . Additionally , the use of ICs to monitor squirrel pathogens is essential because staphylococcal exudative dermatitis ( Simpson et al . 2010 ( Simpson et al . , 2013a and rotaviral enteritis ( Everest et al . 2009a ) show similar lesions to SQPV and SADV , respectively . This presents a clear opportunity for misdiagnosis ( in the absence of other diagnostic tests ) if the pathogen assay reports a false negative , for example due to unrecognised presence of PCR inhibitors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 98}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 499}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 598}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 900, "end": 936}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 989, "end": 1009}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1059, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1073}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
