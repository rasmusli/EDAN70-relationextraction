{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "6", "text": "Hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known open reading frames ( ORFs ) [ 6 ] . ORF1 codes for non structural proteins , essential for viral replication ; ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV , called ORF2 protein ; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host - cell processes during viral infection , and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus [ 7 , 8 ] . Although HEV infection is generally self - limiting , it induces fulminant hepatic failure , which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women . A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF - \u03baB activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients [ 9 ] . However , the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 161}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 202}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 710}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 24}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 488, "end": 492}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 773, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
