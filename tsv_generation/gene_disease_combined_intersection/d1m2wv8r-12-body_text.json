The quantitatively DEPs selected at each time point by method 2 are listed in Supplementary Tables S2 . 1 To analyse the potential functions of the significantly DEPs at each time point , we then performed a gene ontology enrichment of biological processes using DAVID software for the proteins obtained by method 2 . Generally , gene ontology terms are enriched by David software without fuzzy heuristic clustering . So , an overwhelming number of terms were generated , which were too difficult to analyse . In order to reduce the redundant terms , we re - analysed them by \" Functional Annotation Clustering , \" and only the term with the minimum p - value in each cluster was reserved . As a result , 60 / 79 , 57 / 77 , 22 / 33 , 119 / 166 , and 91 / 135 of the biological process terms at each time point were removed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 41}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 886}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
