Using the Metacore TM database , 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation . Besides , a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV - induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection . This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti - cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 367}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 619}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 527}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 537, "end": 551}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 645}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 772}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
