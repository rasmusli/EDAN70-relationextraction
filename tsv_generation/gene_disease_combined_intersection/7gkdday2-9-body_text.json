The extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to single - plex reverse transcription qPCR ( RT - qPCR ) for detection of respiratory viruses including human rhinovirus ( HRV ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , influenza A and B , human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 ( HPIV1 , HPIV2 , HPIV3 ) , human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) , adenovirus , and human bocavirus ( HBoV ) . The RT - qPCR was done using AgPath - ID [UNK] One - Step RT - PCR Kit ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) and CFX96 Touch [UNK] Real - Time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad , CA , USA ) . The results of RT - qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at C t < 40 . 0 . Previously published primers and probes were used for viral pathogen detection by RT - qPCR [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 305}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 370}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 392}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 435}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 490}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 512}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 534}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
