All 10 NTHi strains were evaluated for misidentification of non - haemolytic H . haemolyticus , and all were proven true NTHi . Nine of ten ( 90 % ) NTHI isolates were \u03b2 - lactamase negative and susceptible to ampicillin ( MIC \u2264 1\u03bcg / ml ) and cefuroxime ( MIC \u2264 1\u03bcg / ml ) [ 16 ] . The latter isolate was \u03b2 - lactamase positive , with a MIC = 2\u03bcg / ml for amoxicillin - clavulanate and MIC = 3\u03bcg / ml for cefuroxime . The 4 S . pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin and belonged to serogroups ; ST 6 , ST 9 , ST 11 and ST 19 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 424}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 128}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 270}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
