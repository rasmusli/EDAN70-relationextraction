The expression patterns of viral open reading frames ( ORFs ) were identified and the FRET assay and confocal microscopy were performed to investigate the antiviral mechanism shown in our experimental in vitro and in vivo systems . Taken together , our data support that the antiviral effect against the DNA virus used in this work was caused by ( 1 ) nuclear DNase activity that inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and ( 2 ) RNase activity in the cytoplasm blocked protein translation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 158}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
