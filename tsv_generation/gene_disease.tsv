1108	In fact , @DISEASE$ were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by @GENE$ polarization	1

1123	The objective of this study was to investigate whether intravenous @GENE$ administration could improve the clinical course of @DISEASE$ in patients treated with ECMO	1
1124	Although there are limitations in interpreting the results of experiments , evidence of numerous mechanisms observed under various conditions strongly suggest that viruses also play an important role in the selection of bacteria in the @GENE$ and @DISEASE$ etiology .	1
1125	For example , administration of @GENE$ to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of @DISEASE$ , whereas antibody that neutralizes @GENE$ impairs CTL responses and clearance , thus leading to persistent infection [ 110 , 111 ]	1
