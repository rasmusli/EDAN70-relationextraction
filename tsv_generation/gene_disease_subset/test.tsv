0	From the alignment of seven @GENE$ , we noted a , @GENE$ that was much more divergent than the rest of the protein ( Figure 2A , Alignment S1 )	1
1	This protein segment is completely encoded by the largest exon of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ in humans )	1
2	To illustrate the unusual selective pressures on @GENE$ , we performed a pairwise dN / dS comparison of @GENE$	1
3	We found that whereas the overall dN / dS ratio over @GENE$ is 0	1
4	63 , the dN / dS ratio for @GENE$ alone is 1	1
5	75 (	1
6	95 % confidence for dN / dS	1
7	1 ) ( Table S3 )	1
8	This striking discrepancy between the evolution of @GENE$ and the rest of the protein raised the possibility that this exon alone was responsible for the signature of positive selection in @GENE$	1
9	We therefore repeated our positive selection analyses with @GENE$ alone and found a robust signature of positive selection	1
10	In contrast , the remainder of @GENE$ showed no signature of positive selection upon removal of @GENE$ ( Figure 2B )	1
11	Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility of weak selection acting outside @GENE$ in @GENE$ , our analysis strongly suggests that @GENE$ of @GENE$ has uniquely evolved under strong recurrent positive selection in primates	1
12	Because this evolutionary signature is isolated to a single @GENE$ , we next asked whether @GENE$ is ever excluded from the @GENE$ transcript	1
13	We searched human and rhesus expressed sequence tag ( EST ) databases and found that all isoforms of @GENE$ include @GENE$ , suggesting that @GENE$ is important for @GENE$ function	1
14	Next , we searched the region encoded by @GENE$ for sequence or structural homology to other protein domains	1
15	Surprisingly , secondary structure prediction software ( JPRED [ 46 ] ) indicated that the region encoded by @GENE$ in human @GENE$ is almost entirely disordered	1
16	Taken together , we conclude that @GENE$ has evolved under recurrent positive selection in primates , but that positive selection is focused on the @GENE$ encoded by @GENE$ alone .	1
17	Historically , some studies have used cats for investigating their potential role as reservoir for @DISEASE$	1
18	Pet cats living in the same houses where human cases of @DISEASE$ were diagnosed were examined for the presence of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ or by post mortem histopathological evaluation of the bone marrow and spleen [ 3 , 4 ]	1
19	In Sicily ( southern Italy ) , no case of infection was found by cytological and histological examination of spleen , liver and bone marrow of 120 necropsied cats living in an endemic area [ 5 ]	1
20	The same negative results were obtained in Egypt when spleen cytology and culture were performed on 28 stray cats , and six of them displaying @DISEASE$ were negative also from skin [ 6 ]	1
21	Conversely , in Jordan , amastigotes were detected in liver and spleen smears from about 20 % of 78 stray cats [ 7 ] .	1
22	The exclusion criterions for cases were presence of @DISEASE$ at auscultation , or minors whose parents or legal guardian declined to sign the informed consent statement	1
23	Controls were patients hospitalized for surgery or in a routine outpatient practice environment , aged between 2 and 59 months , without any symptoms suggestive of @DISEASE$ ; suspicion of infection of other site was not an exclusion criteria	1
24	Cases and controls were matched for age ( ± 1 year ) and calendar date of hospital admission ( ± 1 month ) to take seasonality into account	1
25	Thus , 61 % of patients were recruited during the rainy season ( May to October ) while 39 % were recruited during the dry season ( November to April ) .	1
26	Organ samples were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 48 h , routinely processed for histology and 4 - μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE )	1
27	The infundibulum , magnum and uterus were examined for the presence of : ( a ) heterophilic infiltrate ; ( b ) lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate ; ( c ) the presence of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ ; ( d ) @DISEASE$ ; ( e ) the presence of @DISEASE$ and / or cell debris within the lumen	1
28	For each of these pathological features , a score was given as follows : 0 absence of the feature , 1 mild , 2 moderate , 3 severe	1
29	For each section scores were averaged to obtain a mean histopathology score	1
30	Mean scores were averaged for each oviduct section and sampling time .	1
31	We compared the laboratory and radiologic findings between the Adv and Non - Adv groups ( Table 2 )	1

35	@GENE$ ( CNIs )	1
36	Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids , while tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic	1
37	Both drugs bind with high affinity to a family of @GENE$ ( also called @GENE$ ) , which present in a variety of immune cells	1
38	Immunophilindependent signal transduction via @GENE$ represents a key event in the activation of T cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes @GENE$	1
39	Cyclosporine A ( CyA ) binds to @GENE$ , while tacrolimus ( Tac ) binds to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
40	The binding blocks the @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ and subsequently inhibits @GENE$ - induced T cell proliferation by the blockage of @GENE$ production	1
41	Intriguingly , in addition to their promoting role in @GENE$ signalling , @GENE$ are catalysts of protein folding and contribute to the invasion ability of several coronaviruses [ 41 ]	1
42	As to @DISEASE$ , it is well established@GENE$ ilins have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production	1
43	Recent data suggest that @DISEASE$ replication is dependent on the interact@GENE$ clop@GENE$  p@GENE$ n @GENE$  polymerase ) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo s@GENE$ tranded RNA [ 42 ]	1
44	Given th@GENE$ munophilins can work as a supportive role in @DISEASE$ infection , it is rational to find out that CyA is capable of the anti - HCV activity through mediating a speci@GENE$ of @GENE$ ins to NS5B RNA [ 43 ]	1
45	As CyA inte@GENE$ h cy@GENE$ d cyclophilin B , it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV	1
46	However , there is controversy about the anti - HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo @GENE$  contrast , Tac does not have any anti - HCV activity [ 44 ] .	1

54	We demonstrated that PGE 2 increased normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through induction of @GENE$ , an @GENE$ implicated in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of @DISEASE$ growt@GENE$ DK1 siRNA an@GENE$ DK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth	1
55	The PGE 2indu@GENE$ DK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of @GENE$ E 2 receptor subt@GENE$ EP4 and@GENE$ EP4 siRNA	1
56	In addition , we showed that induction@GENE$ DK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of @GENE$ to@GENE$ ein	1
57	Silencing@GENE$ Jun using siRNA and point mutations@GENE$ tes in @GENE$ ter resulted in blockade@GENE$ DK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2	1

59	In experimentally - infected deer mice , @GENE$ can be detected in serum as early as 10 days post infection , and neutralizing antibody can be detected after three weeks post infection [ 13 ]	1
60	Similarly , experimentally - infected bank voles produce @GENE$ two to three weeks after inoculation [ 14 ] and rats experimentally infected with SEOV also produce @GENE$ within two weeks post inoculation [ 52 ]	1
61	The presence of @GENE$ in these naturally and experimentally infected reservoirs is an indicator of class switching and affinity maturation , events that are mediated by T cells [ 53 ]	1
62	Thus , rodents mount adaptive T cell / B cell immune responses to their reservoir hantaviruses ; however , it appears to be inadequate for virus clearance	1
63	While inflammatory signatures are present [ 13 , 20 , 54 ] , the magnitude of these signals appears to be modest relative to expression levels found in a Syrian hamster pathology model of @DISEASE$ [ 55 ]	1
64	It is noteworthy that immunization of rodent reservoirs @GENE$ ige@GENE$ mids encoding the antigen protects from subsequent challenge [ 56 , 57 ] , suggesting infection can be prevented in reservoir hosts .	1
65	The TNS and SBS methods have worked favourably in the livestock network described here	1
66	While one must take care when making inference from a subnetwork to the full network [ 28 ] , it would be of great interest to the broader study of disease spread on partially observed networks to test these strategies further on livestock networks such as those available in other European countries [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ]	1
67	The results of this work provide evidence of the viability of using partially sampled data to predict disease spread in livestock [ 21 ] and humans [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] , and will inform data collection strategies in situations where complete knowledge of the network is impossible ( e	1

72	To determine ciliary beat frequency , both the brain slices and the respiratory cells in culture were placed in an incubation ( 37 ° C ) chamber and were observed via an inverted microscope system ( Nikon TU1000 , Kingstonupon - Thames , UK )	1

77	At least 512 or 1 , 024 frames were captured , respectively .	1
78	This study was a single - center , retrospective cohort study	1
79	We reviewed the medical records of patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital ( Gangwon Province , South Korea , the Referral Hospital for Gangwon Province ) for @GENE$ EASE$ treatment between January of 2014 and December of 2016	1
80	Based on the unique characteristics of the Korean military medical system , all military personnel was treated initially in the military hospital despite a lack of diagnostic modalities	1
81	Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Armed Forces Medical Command ( AFMC - 16051 - IRB - 16 - 041 ) , which waived the need for informed consent because of the retrospective observational nature of the study .	1
82	The M1 family of @GENE$ represents a large number of @GENE$ that cleave single amino acid residues from the @GENE$ terminus of peptide substrates	1
83	One member of this family that has been well studied is @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , a @GENE$ known to cleave biologically active peptides and aide in coronavirus entry	1
84	The proteolytic activity of @GENE$ promotes @DISEASE$ angiogenesis and @DISEASE$ making it an important target for @DISEASE$ therapy	1
85	To understand the substrate specificit@GENE$  APN for the development of targeted inhibitors , we used a global substrate profiling method to determine@GENE$ - P4 ′ amino acid preferences	1
86	The key structural features of@GENE$  APN pharmacophore required for substrate recognition were elucidated by x - ray crystallography	1
87	By combining these substrate profiling and structural data , we were able to design a selective peptide inhibito@GENE$  APN that was an effective therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo against APN - expressing @DISEASE$ models .	1
88	The inhibitory effect of some of the essential oils on the production of @GENE$ reported in this chapter seems to be mediated by suppressing gene expression of these @GENE$	1
89	Such was described by some authors because they found that the essential oils studied significantly suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of the @GENE$ in stimulated cells , assuming therefore , that the inhibitory effect of these essential oils on the expression of the @GENE$ occurs mainly at transcriptional level [ 103 , 116 , 123 , 124 ]	1
90	Thyme essential oil , mainly constituted by pcymene and thymol , only at high concentrations ( 5 , 000 mg / L ) significantly inhibited total mRNA @GENE$ expression in the mouse colon in which @DISEASE$ was induced by @DISEASE$ , not inhibiting signifi@GENE$ IL - 6 expression [ 125 ] .	1
91	In addition to the ability of some essential oils to scavenge free radicals , there is also evidence that some essential oils possess anti - inflammatory activity	1
92	For example , chamomile essential oil has been used for centuries as an anti - inflammatory and also for alleviating the symptoms associated with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and other pronounced irritation [ 17 ]	1
93	However , there are other examples of essential oils ( eucalyptus , rosemary , lavender , millefolia ) along with other plants ( pine , clove and myrrh ) that have been used as mixed formulations as anti - inflammatory agents [ 86 ] .	1
94	We compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Thai CaKoVs against those of reference viruses from the US , UK , Italy , China , and Korea ( Tables 2 and 3 most variable region of @GENE$ is @GENE$ , especially @GENE$	1
95	Putative @GENE$ at @GENE$ ( P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was also observed in Thai CaKoVs as well as reference viruses ( Table 4 )	1
96	In this study , unique amino acids were found in Thai and Chinese CaKoVs at the position , 65 V , 67D , 119L , 138T , 150P , 151M , 153D , 201S , 204Q , 205Q , 201Q , 213T and 241E ( Table 4 )	1
97	Analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among Thai CaKoVs ( Table 5 ) .	1
98	My main concern relates to the assumption of equal health risk associated with both outdoor - and indoor - generated PM2	1
99	5	1
100	The authors discuss this briefly in the Discussion section but this assumption is highly uncertain since almost all of the published epidemiology is based on outdoor PM2	1
101	5	1
102	The paper would benefit from greater emphasis on the sensitivity of the results to this assumption	1
103	Perhaps , the analysis ( or part of it ) could be repeated without the effects of indoorgenerated PM2	1
104	5 or with a reduced exposure - response coefficient ?	1
105	During the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak , mutations within H1N1 accumulated at a relatively constant rate ( Figure 1 )	1
106	The strains sequenced at the end of the pandemic had approximately 80 more mutations than the 2009 reference genotype	1
107	The line of best fit reveals a slope of 42	1
108	1 mutations accumulated per year ( 3	1
109	2 × 10 - 3 mutations per site per year )	1
110	Given that the data were collected from viral strains circulating worldwide , the correlation between mutation count and the date of collection was surprisingly good ( r 2 = 0	1
111	77 ) .	1
112	Even though recent studies have shed light on the role of innate immunity during @DISEASE$ , much remains unknown	1
113	For example , the role of the TLR - TRIF and TLR - MyD88 p@GENE$ in patho@GENE$ and viral recognition	1
114	Furthermore , most studies were performed using LGTV and TBEV , and although they are closely related to POWV , LIV , KFDV , and OHFV , their interactions with the innate immune response might differ	1
115	Although IFN has been shown to st@GENE$ ly control viral tropism and pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ , few antiviral ISGs have been identified	1
116	Vi@GENE$ shown to be the most im@GENE$ ISG in cortical neurons , however , othe@GENE$ Gs that target TBEV expressed in astro@GENE$  and granular cell neurons are yet to be identified and very little is known about the early response against the @DISEASE$	1
117	We also know very little about how the innate immune response regulates the neuroinvasion of neurotropic @DISEASE$ , and the specific interactions between the tick vector and the different viruses .	1
118	Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL was performed following a standardized protocol as previously described [ 14 ]	1
119	Briefly , BAL was performed by instillation of three consecutive aliquots of sterile saline solution ( 20 - 30 - 30 ml ) into the bronchial tree at the area that was most abnormal on the chest radiography	1
120	The right middle lobe or lingual segment was chosen in patients with @DISEASE$	1
121	BAL fluid that was first retrieved was discarded , and BAL fluid that was subsequently retrieved was collected	1
122	The total cell count was determined using a hemocytometer	1
123	The corresponding amount of BAL fluid for 10 3 cells was centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a Thermo Shandon Cytospin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc	1
124	, Waltham , MA , USA ) , at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature	1
125	The slide was airdried and stained with Wright - Giemsa stain	1
126	Differential cell counts that included percentages of neutrophils , lymphocytes , alveolar macrophages , and eosinophils were determined .	1
127	Upon recognition , the different @GENE$ will recruit distinct @GENE$	1
128	@GENE$ recruits @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 121 ] , @GENE$ and 8 recruit @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 122 ] , whereas the @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , recruit @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( also known as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ) [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ]	1
129	Ligation of @GENE$ and downstream recruitment of the @GENE$ result in the activation of transcription factors @GENE$ and @GENE$ and @GENE$ , which translocate to the nucleus and induces the expression and subsequent secretion of @GENE$ [ 127 ] .	1
130	Various other factors - including underlying medical conditions and smoking - can increase the risk of @DISEASE$ by compromising pulmonary clearance mechanisms and the host immune response [ 47 ] , potentially influencing the selection of pathogens in both the URT and LRT	1
131	Age plays a major role in @DISEASE$ risk	1
132	In developed countries , such as the USA , the risk of @DISEASE$ is highest in individuals who are 65 years or over ( Fig	1
133	1 ) [ 48 ]	1
134	The elevated risk in the elderly is likely due to impaired host defenses and an increase in comorbidities - @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and underlying @DISEASE$ increase risk of @DISEASE$ that can occur from @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( reviewed by Akgün et al	1
135	[ 49 ] )	1
136	In developing countries , the burden of @DISEASE$ is greatest in young children [ 2 ] due to their inability to physically remove and immunologically deal with bacterial pathogens ( reviewed by Siegrist [ 50 ] )	1
137	Very young children also have the greatest prevalence in the nasopharynx of common @DISEASE$ pathogens : S	1
138	pneumoniae , H	1
139	influenzae and M	1
140	catarrhalis [ 23 , 51 ]	1
141	Increased carriage may be an important risk factor for @DISEASE$ if the URT bacterial community structure is a determinant of @DISEASE$ etiology	1
142	Unfortunately , the majority of carriage studies have been conducted among children < 5 years of age , which limits our ability to establish the role of nasopharyngeal carriage in other age groups .	1
143	@DISEASE$ were generally localised to cutaneous areas in grey squirrels ( Fig	1

168	Is the question posed original , important and well defined ?	1
169	Our assays offer several advantages over assays for SQPV ( Atkin et al	1
170	2010 ; Fiegna et al	1
171	2016 ; McInnes et al	1
172	2009 ) and SADV ( Everest et al	1

174	g	1
175	insufficient DNA purification and PCR inhibition ) via the use of a specific squirrel endogenous IC	1
176	In fact , the latter factor proved important in 7 out of 24 faecal samples analysed when screening samples , when , despite apparently adequate amounts of DNA , no amplification for the PGK assay ( or either pathogen assay ) was recorded	1
177	In the absence of an IC , these samples could have been classed as negative and highlight that a differing extraction process is required for faecal samples	1

179	To address whether ADP - ribosylation plays a broad role in viral immunity , we wished to take a comprehensive evolutionary approach to look for evidence of rapid evolution in all of the @GENE$	1
180	We reasoned that evolutionary signatures of recurrent adaptation , such as those previously observed in @GENE$ , might reveal other @GENE$ that are involved in host - virus interactions	1
181	We therefore screened all 17 @GENE$ and their @GENE$ for signatures of recurrent positive selection	1
182	Contrary to expectations that most @GENE$ are involved in ' housekeeping ' functions , we found that nearly one third of @GENE$ bore signatures of recurrent genetic conflicts	1
183	In addition to @GENE$ , our evolutionary screen revealed four other @GENE$ that have evolved under very strong positive selection in primates : @GENE$ , 9 , 14 and 15	1
184	Two of these genes ( @GENE$ and 15 ) have also undergone dramatic gene turnover ( gain and loss ) during vertebrate evolution , an additional hallmark of gene innovation also seen in @GENE$ such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 38 , 39 ]	1
185	Based on their rapid evolution , we hypothesize that these four additional @GENE$ are involved in as - yetundescribed host - virus conflicts	1
186	Importantly , we anticipate that the identification of these rapidly evolving @GENE$ and domains will enable future experiments to elucidate the role ADPribosylation plays in viral replication and host immunity .	1
187	Current techniques for cellular delivery of antivirals include targeted liposomes in cell culture and in mice [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] , receptor - mediated endocytosis through antibody binding in cell culture and in mice [ 15 ] , retroviral vectors in cell culture [ 16 ] , as well as adenoviruses in vaccine delivery [ 17 ]	1
188	However these techniques present certain limitations and concerns : low efficiency [ 11 , 15 ] , immunogenicity [ 14 , 15 ] , stability and rapid clearance in bloodstream [ 18 ] for liposomal reagents , and immunogenicity and viral integration on host gene expression for viral vectors [ 15 , 19 ] .	1
189	The study individuals were prioritized in groups according to the transmission intensity of the @DISEASE$ case they were exposed to , as follows : contact with super - spreading events ( 5 or more individuals infected ) [ 21 ] , contact with spreaders who infected 1 to 4 individuals , and contact with non - spreaders	1
190	We selected study subjects according to this prioritization of groups , and the selection rates were 48	1
191	8 , 16	1
192	4 , and 15	1
193	8 % , respectively	1
194	We also categorized the subjects according to their exposure intensity ( i	1
195	e	1
196	, status when they were exposed to the @DISEASE$ case ) , as follows : inpatients or outpatients at a @DISEASE$ - affected hospital , cohabiting family members or paid caregivers of the @DISEASE$ case , visitors of the hospitalized @DISEASE$ case , healthcare workers employed at a @DISEASE$ - affected hospital , and colleague of the @DISEASE$ case	1
197	We selected more subjects from the categories of family , patients , and visitors ( Table 1 ) .	1
198	Again , after January , there was a gradual decline in specimen collection rate from February ( 8	1
199	5 % ; n = 17 ) to May ( 0 % ) , followed by 2 % ( n = 4 ) and 1 % ( n = 2 ) collection rates in June and July , respectively	1
200	The specimen collection rate started rising sharply in August ( 11 % ; n = 22 )	1
201	In brief , most of the specimens ( 90 % ; n = 180 ) were collected during the study period between August and February	1
202	Further analysis of seasonality in terms of individual viral and bacterial pathogens will be elaborated in the later part of the article .	1
203	The route of transmission has important ramifications in terms of the host immune response where , presumably , a mucosal response occurs with aerosol transmission and a localized response at a bite site	1
204	Experimental data have also shown that patterns of the expression of genes related to the immune response are different in infected males and females [ 32 ] , and it is likely these differences have important roles in hantavirus ecology	1
205	Spillover to other rodent species also occurs [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , but it is unknown if the rodents remain infected	1
206	Recent work has shown that deer mice are experimentally susceptible to @DISEASE$ ; however , virus is cleared several weeks after infection [ 37 ]	1
207	A pronounced Th2 / Tfh gene expression profile occurs , inclu@GENE$  - 4 pathway activation , that does not appear to be substantially activated in @DISEASE$ - infected deer mice [ 13 , 38 ]	1
208	This system provides an opportunity t@GENE$ st factors that are important for sterilizing immunity that clears infection .	1
209	@GENE$ and @GENE$ are comprised largely of a @GENE$ that exhibits low intrinsic activity ( Cohn et al	1
210	, 2009 ; Kee et al	1
211	, 2010 ; Faesen et al	1
212	, 2011 )	1
213	Biochemical and proteomic studies showed that two @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( also known as @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ , interact with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Cohn et al	1
214	, 2009 ; Sowa et al	1
215	, 2009 ; Kee et al	1
216	, 2010 )	1
217	@GENE$ stimulates the activity of three @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , a @GENE$ which regulates the @DISEASE$ DNA damage pathway ( Cohn et al	1

225	, 2011 )	1
226	Intriguingly , a large - scale proteomic analysis of DUB -@GENE$ K293 cells revealed that 36 % of the 75 DUBs @GENE$ zed interact with a WDR p@GENE$ gesting a broad role for WDR p@GENE$ gulating DUBs @GENE$ a et al	1
227	, 2009 ) .	1
228	At present , @GENE$ have been described to welcome incoming viral particles and retain them into endosomal vesicles , where they are subsequently degraded [ 7 , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
229	Interestingly , this mechanism of inhibition seems to be active against both pH - dependent and - independent viruses that require or not the low pH of endosomes to trigger viral - to - cell membrane fusion [ 22 , 23 ]	1
230	The finding that pH - independent viruses can also functionally access the cytosol from endosomal vesicles likely explains the broad antiviral effects of @GENE$ against these diverse classes of virus [ 24 ] .	1
231	@DISEASE$ was less common in this study population , with only two cats having concurrent @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ and three cats with @DISEASE$ alone	1
232	It was considered that there may have been a lack of awareness or appreciation of @DISEASE$ in the cats given the absorptive nature of litter that could have made @DISEASE$ less recognizable to owner	1
233	The FCS chart included images of stool within litter to help educate and increase awareness of the owners participating in this study ; however , overall frequency of @DISEASE$ remained low and did not significantly change over the 4 - week period .	1
234	Blood collected from STG90 and wild - type mice was centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm for 10 min , and plasma was stored at 220uC until analysis	1
235	Plasma levels of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and other @GENE$ were analyzed using an automatic blood chemistry analyzer ( Selectra II , Merck , Germany ) .	1
236	Most stakeholders considered @DISEASE$ a significant threat to Singapore and global health , but they also mentioned that it was not given the highest priority in the list of local healthcare challenges until several outbreaks of @DISEASE$ changed the perception of policymakers and administrators with regards to its risk and standing	1
237	Until the early 2010s , issues such as ageing population and @DISEASE$ were rated much higher in priority compared to @DISEASE$ .	1
238	Using 50 mg / ml of @GENE$ or Den3 , transcytosis of @GENE$ alone increased approximately 3 fold from about 0	1
239	4 % at pH 7	1
240	4 to about 1	1
241	3 % at pH 6	1
242	0 ( Figure S4 )	1
243	However , the effect of @GENE$ transcytosis on @GENE$ alone does not appear as strong as the effect on @GENE$ , where , for example , with complexes made with 50 mg / ml of @GENE$ or @GENE$ , there was about an 8 - fold increase in transcytosis under conditions allowing @GENE$ engagement	1
244	This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of @GENE$ by the epithelial cells at both pH 6	1
245	0 and pH 7	1
246	4 ; @GENE$ thus internalized can engage @GENE$ in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells [ 41 ]	1
247	The internalization of @GENE$ , on the other hand , likely depends primarily on @GENE$ engagement at the surface of the cell at pH 6	1
248	0 .	1
249	The literature on @DISEASE$ spoke to two of the four themes of the politics of epidemics , namely the credibility of evidence informing response pathways and the attribution of @DISEASE$ disease responsibility .	1
250	We carried out competition experiments to assess whether the @GENE$ V mRNA@GENE$ ariant or a@GENE$ ng RNA from poliovirus Figure S4 )	1
251	Consistent with expectation , a dose - dependent reduction in frameshifting efficiency was observed upon addition of short , uncapped transcripts containing the @D@GENE$ SV @GENE$  loop IV RNAs , but not wit@GENE$  control mRNA with the C - rich stretch mutated .	1
252	VOC controls can be reached by comprehensive labelling systems for low emission products	1
253	Dampness controls need to combine structural improvements with - 12 - active / online and passive warning sensors	1
254	The most challenging element was considered to be particulate matter	1
255	The proposed 25 % reduction can be achieved with target exhausts in kitchens , avoiding use of candles and improved design of combustion devices .	1
256	The airflow pattern in this airplane cabin was first simulated in the steady - state	1
257	The inlet velocity was 2	1
258	994 m / s , corresponding to 9	1
259	7 L / s / person	1
260	The air exchange rate for the supply inlet conditions was 36	1
261	52ACH	1
262	The boundary conditions are shown in Table 2 [ 8 , 18 , 19 , 22 ]	1
263	The effects of the human thermal plume on the airflow motion was also considered and numerical simulated in the computational geometry	1
264	The surface temperature of the seated passengers was numerical set , following the method given by previous studies [ 18 , 19 , 22 ]	1
265	Since the inhalation and exhalation airflow velocity in the breathing zone of the person was small [ 30 , 31 ] , the influence of the respiration on aerosols transmission can be regarded as insignificant	1
266	So the personal respirations of the passengers were not simulated in this work [ 18 ]	1
267	For the respiratory activities of the index patient , breathing and cough is very common for @DISEASE$ infector	1
268	According to previous studies , the droplets expelled by breathing are much smaller and fewer than that of coughing [ 32 ]	1
269	So in this work , coughing was considered as the main aerosol release process of the index patient , and the dissemination process of the coughing droplets were numerical simulated .	1
270	@GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ have been described as important @GENE$ for monocyte recruitment ( 37 ) ( 38 ) ( 39 )	1
271	Consequently , we determined the @GENE$	1
272	The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate	1
273	Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals	1

279	Two datasets were created for phylogenetic analyses	1
280	Dataset 1 was designed to assess the spatial structure of vampire bat - associated Bartonella across Latin America and therefore included our new sequences plus all previously reported @GENE$ from Desmodus rotundus	1
281	Dataset 2 was designed to capture the relatedness of the new sequences to all previously described Bartonella spp	1
282	regardless of isolation source , which comprised sequences generated in this study plus sequences obtained by conducting a BLAST search of each new sequence against GenBank , selecting the top 10 hits , and removing duplicates	1
283	For both datasets , consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT	1
284	Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in @GENE$ using the GTR + gamma model suggested by jModeltest2 [ 56 ]	1
285	For dataset 1 ( Desmodus - associated sequences ) , we fit a codon partitioned substitution model by linking rates in @GENE$ 1 and 2 separately from codon position 3	1
286	For dataset 2 , we used a simpler non - partitioned model because the more complex codon - partitioned model failed to converge	1
287	Dataset 2 included one sequence from Brucella abortus ( Genbank Locus : MIJI01000003	1
288	1 ) as an outgroup [ 13 ]	1
289	Both datasets were run for 2	1
290	5 million generations with convergence checked and burn - in periods selected by assessing posterior traces in Tracer [ 57 ]	1
291	With dataset 1 , we analyzed spatial clustering of @DISEASE$ by country ( Belize , Guatemala , Mexico , Peru ) using Bayesian Tip Association Significance Testing ( BaTS ) [ 58 ]	1
292	We here selected 1 , 000 trees from the posterior distribution of the MrBayes run a@GENE$ red the country - level clustering to a null distribution from 10 , 000 trees with swapped tip associations [ 58 ] .	1
293	To determine which domain ( s ) of @GENE$ is responsible for the association with @GENE$ , a series of @GENE$ of @GENE$ were constructed ( Figure 2A ) and tested for the interaction with @GENE$ by Co - IP assay	1
294	The results showed that @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were capable of binding @GENE$ ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that the @GENE$ is critical for the NS5A @GENE$ interaction	1
295	in a yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) system	1
296	Yeast Y2HGold strain was cotransformed with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) as a bait and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) as a prey	1
297	As a positive control , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain	1
298	Cotransformation of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ was used as a negative control	1
299	All the yeast colonies cotransformed with the above @GENE$ were grown on synthetically defined ( SD ) medium lacking His and Leu ( SD / - 2 ) , SD medium lacking His , Leu , Trp and Ade ( SD / - 4 ) and SD / - 4 medium containing 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - α - D - galactopyranoside ( X - α - Gal ) and aureobasidin A ( Aba ) ( SD / - 4 / @GENE$ - α - Gal / Aba ) ; ( B ) @GENE$ - transferase ( @GENE$ ) pulldown assay	1
300	The @GENE$ or GST - NS5A fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) were purified with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with the lysate of HEK293T cells overexpressing the @GENE$	1
301	After washing with cold PBS , the bound proteins were subjected to sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( 10 % ) and Western blotting using the anti - GST polyclonal antibody ( PAb ) ( 1 : 2000 ) and the anti - Myc monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) ( 1 : 1000 ) ; ( C ) Coimmunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) analysis of Myc - tagged eEF1A and Flag - tagged NS5A	1
302	HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids ( + ) or empty vectors ( - ) for 48 h	1
303	The transfected cells were lyzed and incubated with a mouse anti - Flag MAb , followed by incubation with the Protein G - Agarose for 6 h at 4 ˝ C	1
304	The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti - Flag MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) and a rabbit anti - Myc PAb ( 1 : 500 ) ; ( D ) Co - IP analysis of eEF1A and NS5A by the anti - Myc MAb	1
305	HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids ( + ) or empty vectors ( ´ ) , the cell lysate was collected at 48 h post - transfection ( hpt ) , incubated with the anti - Myc MAb and Protein G - Agarose	1
306	The immunoprecipitate was examined by Western blotting using the anti - Flag MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) and the anti - Myc PAb ( 1 : 500 ) ; ( E ) Effects of RNase A / T1 treatment on the NS5A - eEF1A interaction	1
307	Extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing different proteins were treated or untreated with RNase A / T1 for 1 h prior to Co - IP and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies	1
308	The total RNA in the immunoprecipitate was visualized by ethidium bromide - staining ; ( F ) Colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A	1
309	HEK293T cells were cotransfected with p3ˆFlag - NS5A and pMyc - eEF1A	1
310	Cells were fixed at 48 hpt and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect 3ˆFlag - NS5A ( green ) and Myc - eEF1A ( red ) with mouse anti - Flag and rabbit anti - Myc antibodies	1
311	The position of the nucleus is indicated by DAPI ( blue ) staining in the merged image	1

315	The second method on which Iterative HFold builds , called HFold - PKonly , is similar to @GENE$ except that @GENE$ may only contain @GENE$ that cross @GENE$ in @GENE$	1
316	The prediction provided by @GENE$ can be useful in cases where @GENE$ does not produce a @GENE$ .	1
317	Many computational methods for predicting the secondary structure of an RNA ( or DNA ) molecule are based on models of the free energy of loops [ 23 , 25 , 26 , [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] 48 ]	1
318	Table 1 summarizes the energy constants and functions used in our energy model for pseudoknotted structures	1
319	The values of these energy parameters are those of the DP09 parameter set of Andronescu et al	1

322	Finally , we were able to identify proteins from Zika virus that have been just recently related to autophagy	1
323	Independent studies have shown that Zika virus activates autophagy and that the formation of autophagosomes is crucial to the replication of the virus	1
324	[ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] It appears that the nonstructural proteins @GENE$ and @GENE$ are responsible for the induction of autophagy in infected cells by inhibiting the AKT @GENE$ signaling , and both of them contain 3 WxxL motifs	1
325	80 , 82 Very little is known about the relation between @DISEASE$ and autophagy modulation	1
326	We have found several proteins encoded by Zika genome@GENE$ n LIR motifs @GENE$ d be good candidates for experimental validation .	1
327	We have extracted natural geranylated flavonoids from P	1
328	tomentosa and shown that they exhibit notable kinetic properties against @GENE$ from C	1
329	perfringens , a bacterium causing various @DISEASE$	1
330	We also found that diplacone is the most effective inhibitor among these flavonoids	1
331	This inhibitor also shows a time - dependent competitive inhibition pattern	1

338	Furthermore , aryl groups ( phenyl or benzyl ) may form a potential dipole - dipole interaction with Phe353 .	1
339	Virus replication was assessed by quantification of the virus - associated @GENE$ activity by [ 32 P ] - thymidine triphosphate ( TTP ) incorporation , using an @GENE$ as described elsewhere [ 58 ]	1
340	To determine the replication capacity of HIV - 1 following infection with HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 or the field isolate 4lig7 , the respective replication profiles were depicted as diagram ( y - axis : RT activity ; x - axis : dpi )	1
341	To calculate the arithmetic mean of the values obtained from experiments performed in HLAC from different donors the area under the curve of each replication profile was calculated and defined as the corresponding replication capacity	1
342	In every experiment the replication capacity of the untreated wt was set to 100 % and compared with the inhibitor treated samples .	1
343	Throughout the study , ovaries were productive as multiple follicles were visible during necropsies .	1
344	In conclusion , although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases , with the limited available data , and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression , smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID - 19 .	1

349	We compare four imperfect data types : random sampling of movements ( weighted edges ) , random sampling of farms ( nodes ) , SBS [ 30 , 36 ] of farms and targeted sampling of farms	1
350	If appropriate , we then scale the sampled networks up , so that the original number of movements is used for the epidemic simulations	1
351	In the UK , selling and buying of livestock often takes place through livestock markets	1
352	Previous work suggests that these markets played a substantial role during the 2001 @DISEASE$ outbreak [ 10 ]	1
353	As animals from different farms are kept in close proximity , there is a risk of disease transmission between batches of animals resulting in spread of infection to multiple farms	1
354	Moreover , it is known that movements from markets cover a large geographical area [ 37 ]	1
355	Therefore , we investigate the potential role of markets in disease transmission between farms .	1
356	We confirm the association of @DISEASE$ with infection burden and present evidence for putative interaction with sports activity and dietary patterns .	1
357	The infection caused by @DISEASE$ has an average incubation time of 5 days ( 2 - 14 days range )	1
358	The host , in this time period , shows no symptoms of infection	1
359	The clinical symptoms of the disease range from mild symptoms of @DISEASE$ like @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ to severe forms such as @DISEASE$ , as well as @DISEASE$	1
360	Patients may also suffer from @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$	1
361	The less commonly occurring symptoms include @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ without any hint of @DISEASE$ [ 29 ]	1
362	Studies advocate that @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , increase the risk of @DISEASE$ and its severity [ 30 ] , though further proof is required .	1
363	In addition to of higher health benefits , in comparison with the filtration - based scenario 2 the advantage is that with source control the lower dilution need ( i	1

367	The plant materials were washed thoroughly and separated into different parts , namely , root , bulb , stem , leaves , flower , and anther .	1
368	Distinct classes of ODN have been shown to induce differential immune responses [ 20 ]	1
369	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) consist of @GENE$ in a phosphodiester core , flanked on both ends by @GENE$	1
370	@GENE$ of this class are characterized by their potential to both induce massive @GENE$ secretion by pDCs [ 12 ] and increase NK cytotoxicity [ 21 ] , rendering them ideal candidates as prophylactic enhancers of innate immunity to @DISEASE$	1
371	Conversely , class B@GENE$  B@GENE$ ch encode multiple CpG mot@GENE$ osphorothioate backbone , promote monocyte maturation and B cell activation , thus substantially supporting the development of humoral immune responses [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]	1
372	Both CpG - A@GENE$  - B@GENE$ dicated immunostimulatory properties in immune cells of mice , primates and many domestic species in vitro [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] , while in vivo studies in outbred animals have mainly been carried out with CpG - B@GENE$ 32 , 33 ]	1
373	Concerning the cat , specifically synthesized CpG - A@GENE$ es were recently shown to induce IFNγ [ @GENE$ ; CpG - B@GENE$ es indicated the capability to induce proliferation of feline cells [ 35 ] , and CpG - B@GENE$ anted allergen indicated potential for immunotherapy in a feline @DISEASE$ model [ 36 ]	1
374	Although class C [ 37 , 38 ] and class P ODN [ 39 ] were developed in more recent years in an effort to combine the advantageous effects of both CpG @GENE$ CpG @GENE$ increase immunogenicity , CpG @GENE$ in the strongest inducers of type@GENE$ ribed to date .	1
375	Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$	1
376	Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone	1
377	Evolutionary analyses of pathogen g@GENE$ ly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of @DISEASE$ viruses , but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility , mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene@GENE$ cal data on host movement can be combined	1
378	Here , we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human @DISEASE$ subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human @DISEASE$ worldwide	1
379	Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human @DISEASE$ while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread , we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows , whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance	1
380	Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global @DISEASE$ diversity	1
381	By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009 , we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated	1
382	In conclusion , the global dynamics of @DISEASE$ are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes	1
383	The integrat@GENE$ troduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control .	1
384	Profiling of Host Cell Response to Successive Canine Parvovirus Infection Based on Kinetic Proteomic Change Identification @GENE$ 	1
385	Given that a recent report suggested that @GENE$ could be associated to exosomes upon overexpression in HEK293T cells [ 30 ] and given that exosomes share numerous characteristics with retroviral particles , we carried out @GENE$ - depletion assays to determine whether @GENE$ were associated to HIV - 1 virion particles or to co - purifying exosomes	1
386	This assay takes advantage of a technique developed by the Ott lab that is based on the fact that @GENE$ is incorporated in exosomes , but is excluded from retroviral particles [ 31 ]	1
387	Given that @GENE$ is a T cell marker , we first obtained stable cell lines expressing each @GENE$ in SupT1 cells and then infected these cells with high MOIs of HIV - 1 to obtain a large number of virion producing cells	1
388	Virion particles were then retrieved 6 days after and were then treated with CD45magnetic beads or not prior to WB analysis ( Figure 2E )	1
389	Under these conditions , @GENE$ was efficiently removed Figure 2 @GENE$ are @GENE$	1
390	A ) HEK293T cells were transfected with @GENE$ coding @GENE$ and HIV - 1 and two days after , both cell lysates and supernatant purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion were harvested and analyzed by WB	1
391	The panels present typical results obtained out of 10 independent experiments	1
392	B and C ) HEK293T cells were transfected as above by maintaining a fixed amount of @GENE$ and by varying the amount of DNAs coding the different @GENE$	1
393	Virion particles were purified by ultracentrifugation , normalized by exo - RT and either analyzed by WB to determine the amount of @GENE$ incorporated onto the virion particles ( B ) , or used to challenge HEK293T cells to determine their infectivity ( C )	1
394	D ) Virions produced in the presence of @GENE$ were first concentrated and purified through sucrose as described above then layered onto a linear OptiprepTM velocity gradient ( 5 to 20 % w / v ) for an ultracentrifugation step of 45 minutes at 28 , 000 rpm	1
395	Aliquots were harvested from the top of the gradient , precipitated with @GENE$ and analyzed by WB	1
396	The proportion of CA and IFITMs present in each fraction with respect to the total CA and IFITMs in all fractions was determined by densitometry and is presented here solely for IFITM3 due to space constraints	1
397	The density of each fraction was determined prior to TCA precipitation with a bench densitometer and is presented here as a dotted grey line ( g / mL )	1
398	The graph and associated WB panels are representative of 3 independent experiments	1
399	E ) Virion particles produced from SupT1 cells stably expressing Flag - IFITMs were subjected or not to CD45 depletion , prior to WB analysis	1
400	The Western blot panels are representative of 3 independent experiments	1
401	by viral preparations	1
402	However , the amount of IFITMs present in HIV - 1 viral preparations was unaffected by the treatment , except for a small decrease observed in the case of IFITM1	1
403	Overall , these results indicate that IFITMs are bona fide virion - associated proteins .	1
404	Given that we had observed resistance mutations in both @GENE$ after passaging virus in polyamine - depleted cells , we hypothesized that viral @GENE$ activity may be modulated by cellular polyamines	1
405	While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance @GENE$ activity [ 32 , 33 ] , a role for polyamines in viral @GENE$ activity has never been reported	1
406	Toward this end , we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines	1
407	Following incubation with a drug , cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h , at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis	1
408	Lysates were analyzed for the presence of @GENE$ , a cellular target of the @GENE$	1
409	We observed that in infected cells , a distinct @GENE$ band was present ; however , in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm , @GENE$ cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A )	1
410	We were unable to visualize full - length @GENE$ , likely due to its large size .	1
411	With resistance mutations emerging in @GENE$ , we next hypothesized that these mutations may enhance viral replication in polyamine - depleted cells by maintaining proteolytic activity	1
412	To test this , we generated @GENE$ through site - directed mutagenesis of our @GENE$	1
413	We then cotransfected these @GENE$ and the wildtype	1
414	In total , 76 ( 13	1
415	8 % ) of 552 @DISEASE$ patients were positive for HAdV	1
416	The prevalence of HAdV among inpatient children with @DISEASE$ in Northern China was 20	1

418	2 % , n = 24 ) ( P < 0	1
419	0001 )	1
420	Most of the @DISEASE$ occurred in children aged 6 months to 2 years ( Table 2 )	1
421	The seasonal distribution indicated that most of the @DISEASE$ occurred during the winter and spring ( Table 3 )	1
422	However , no season variation was shown for @DISEASE$ in this study .	1
423	@DISEASE$ is usually associated with the proliferation of one or more strains of β - hemolytic ETEC in the small intestine of pigs , in particular those that express fimbrial adhesins F4 ( K88 ) or @GENE$  [@GENE$ 	1

425	The genetic predisposition of the pig is primordial for the development of @DISEASE$ [ 28 ] .	1
426	Each specimen in pool 1 ( patients T32 , T794 , T359 , T560 and T524 ) was analyzed individually using the @GENE$ - specific real - time reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) targeting the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ 5 ′ - CCA TCA GCA GTT ACY GGG TCT GT - 3 ′ ; @GENE$ 5 ′ - CGT GGC TCC AGG TGA YTG T - 3 ′ ; probe 5 ′ - FAM - TTT CCG CAT ATC CC - MGB _ NFQ - 3 ′ ) under the following cycling conditions : 50 ° C for 30 min ; 95 ° C for 15 min ; 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 ° C and 1 min at 55 ° C	1
427	Patient T359 was confirmed positive for @GENE$ ( Ct value = 29	1
428	6 ; Figure 1 )	1
429	The initial T359 nasopharyngeal specimen was reanalyzed individually by NGS	1
430	NGS data were analyzed with ezVIR and completed by performing a de novo analysis	1
431	As shown in the ezVIR phase 2 report , 91	1
432	5 % coverage of the @GENE$ was obtained ( 305 mapped reads ) , with a maximum coverage depth of 11 - fold	1
433	Phylogenetic analysis of the @GENE$ ( 1077 nucleotides long ) obtained from de novo assembly 5 shows the closest nucleotide homology ( 97	1
434	8 % ; Figure 1 ) with the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , corresponding to @GENE$ )	1
435	The presence of a @DISEASE$ ( PIV - 4 ) was also detected in the ezVIR phase 2 report , with lower signals for both parameters ( 174 mapped reads , 38	1
436	5 % genome coverage , maximum coverage depth of sevenfold )	1
437	However , using the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 commercial assay ( Fast - track Diagnostics , Sliema , Malta ) , the PIV - 4 genome wa@GENE$ in the specimen , suggesting a viral load below the limit of detection of this assay ( the limit of positivity was Ct values ⩽ 37 ) @GENE$ y contrast , in agreement with the ezVIR phase 2 report for pool 1 ( Figure 1 ) , patients T32 and T794 were confirmed positive for PIV - 2 ( Ct value = 21	1
438	6 ) and PIV - 4 ( Ct value = 31 ) , respectively , by specific real - time RT - PCR	1
439	This finding suggests that the PIV - 4 - negative result in patient T359 reflects a very low viral load rather than potential mismatches between the assay target and the viral genome sequences of some PIV - 4 circulating in this specific area during the study	1
440	For this reason , PIV - 4 is considered unlikely to be responsible for the respiratory symptoms in this patient	1
441	Furthermore , an intrinsic consequence of highly sensitive NGS technology is the increased detection of interspecimen contamination	1
442	Therefore , the presence of several thousands of PIV - 4 mapped reads in pool 1 and pools 4 , 5 and 6 allows the possibility of potential contamination from neighboring PIV - 4 - positive samples .	1
443	To investigate the effects of @GENE$ on the CSFV replication , stable PK - 15 cell line overexpressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was generated and infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0	1

445	The @GENE$ expression in the CSFV - infected PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells was decreased at 48 and 72 h post - infection ( hpi ) , compared with that in the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3A , B )	1
446	Real - time RT - PCR analysis revealed that the @GENE$ copies in the PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi , compared with the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3C )	1
447	Additionally , yields of infectious virus in culture supernatant of PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were decreased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 3D )	1
448	The results indicated the @GENE$ negatively modulates the CSFV replication .	1
449	MINI REVIEW Function of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme @GENE$ in the Nervous System and Its Regulation by @GENE$ 	1
450	We defined a case of @DISEASE$ according to the World Health Organization case definition for all hospitalised children in whom the onset of illness occurred within 7 days of admission [ 22 ]	1
451	Basic demographic and clinical information and laboratory results were recorded for each patient using a standardised form	1
452	Specimens were collected on the day of admission	1
453	Two separate banks of specimens between May 2007 and March 2010 were used in this investigation	1
454	The first set consisted of 259 nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA ) specimens collected from paediatric patients with @DISEASE$ in Beijing ( Northern China )	1
455	The second specimen bank comprised 293 induced sputum ( IS ) specimens from paediatric patients with @DISEASE$ in Zhejiang Province ( Eastern China )	1
456	All of the samples were collected from the patients at the first day of admission and placed in viral transport medium and stored at - 80 ° C until tested .	1
457	One or more specific influenza - associated diagnoses / complications were reported for 42 ( 89	1
458	4 % ) of the 47 children ( Table 4 )	1
459	The most frequent diagnosis was @DISEASE$ ( 61	1
460	7 % ) , followed by @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ ( 31	1
461	9 % ) , and secondary @DISEASE$ ( 25	1
462	5 % )	1
463	@DISEASE$ was reported for 10 ( 21	1
464	3 % ) and @DISEASE$ for six children ( 12	1
465	8 % ) ; other complications were rare	1
466	Thirty - nine of the 47 patients ( 83	1
467	0 % ) underwent a chest radiograph .	1
468	Irrespective of the overall common suppressive action in draining LN during @DISEASE$ , the function of endogenous Foxp3 @GENE$  migrating to and residing in the CNS throughout persistence remains obscure	1
469	Despite the prolonged reduction of Tregs by DT - mediated depletion , we found no evidence of altered pathogenesis	1
470	Regulation of the CNS autoimmune responses by Foxp3 @GENE$ is also ineffective during @DISEASE$ ( 48 )	1
471	Despite @GENE$ + Treg accumulation within the inflamed CNS , their functions were abrogated by pro - inflammatory cytokines @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
472	Expression of both cytokines during @DISEASE$ infection ( 49 ) suggests they may have similar suppressive activity on l@GENE$ oxp3 + Treg	1
473	Alternatively , a potential defici@GENE$ Treg access to @DISEASE$ , with perivascular retention , may explain their inability to regulate @DISEASE$ and will require further investigation	1
474	It is also possible that residual Foxp3 + Tregs dete@GENE$ ter DT treatment may be sufficient to control @DISEASE$	1
475	The minor Foxp3 + Treg population d@GENE$ d at day 28 p	1
476	i	1
477	presumably comprises rebound Tregs , as well as a small proportion of DT insensitive Foxp3 + cells detected in adult DEREG mice ( 23 )	1
478	While rebound Tregs are dysfunctional ( 28 ) , DT - resistant Foxp3 + Tr@GENE$ t against lethal @DISEASE$ and may thus suffice to control the SR CD4 + T cells during @DISEASE$ ( 23 )	1
479	It nevertheless remains intriguing that residual Foxp3 + Tregs in CLN appear to exert more@GENE$ ssive capacities than in the CNS	1
480	In contrast to the lack of Foxp3 + Treg suppressive function within @GENE$ S , IL - 27R − / − mice displayed increased v@GENE$ SR CD4 + T cell responses , implicating Tr1 cells as a major regulator of @DISEASE$ during @DISEASE$	1
481	Impaired IL - 27 signaling was associated with decreased IL - 10 + vir@GENE$ cific CD4 + T cells and delayed viral control ( 15 )	1
482	The present results indeed confirmed that Tr1 cells dampened the virus - specific Th1 cell response within the CNS	1
483	However , a greater increase of SR CD4 + T cells was observed in the CNS of IL - 27R − / − mice , indicating that Tr1 cells are also critical in limiting autoimmunity during chronic JHMV infection	1
484	It remains to be determined whether Tr1 cells restricting SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection are myelin - specific , as Tr1 regulatory function efficacy was shown to be dependent upon antigen specificity ( 50 , 51 )	1
485	The mechanisms associated with Tr1 - dependent suppression of CNS SR T cells may involve IL - 10 secretion , granzyme B , and perforin production , inhibitory molecule expression , or metabolic regulation ( 52 )	1
486	Finally , the implication of SR CD4 + T cells in promoting tissue damage and clinical autoimmunity during JHMV infection remain unclear , as increased myelin - specific CD4 + T cells in IL - 27R − / − mice correlated with a moderate decrease , rather than expected increase in demyelination ( 15 )	1
487	It cannot be excluded that despite their increased frequency , the overall low numbers of myelin - specific CD4 + T cells are insufficient to achieve effector threshold levels required to affect myelin loss or tissue damage	1
488	Prolonged studies may be necessary to reveal altered tissue damage , as demyelination in IL - 27R − / − mice was quantified only until day 30 p	1
489	i	1
490	( 15 )	1
491	It also remains a possibility that compensatory mechanisms occur in the absence of Tr1 cells	1
492	IL - 10 is critical in limiting demyelination during JHMV persistence and is produced by both Foxp3 + Tregs and Tr1 cells	1
493	Surprisingly however , no difference in IL - 10 mRNA levels was detected between WT and IL - 27R − / − mice during chronic JHMV infection ( 42 ) , indicating another cell type may compensate for the lack of Tr1 cells .	1
494	Quantification of @GENE$ and RNA from cells of SCH07072 , muSCH , and HeLa was carried out by harvesting the cells at 2 hours post infection ( HPI ) with HSV - 1 , 6	1
495	5 HPI , and 25 HPI for immediate early stage , early stage , and late stage , respectively as summarized in Figure 5A	1
496	RNA was isolated from cells and mouse tissues ( liver , muscle , lung , and brain ) using Corezol reagent ( CoreBio System ) [ 41 ]	1
497	@GENE$ was synthesized from 5 mg of total RNA using @GENE$ hexamers and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
498	All primers were designed using the Primer 3 program	1
499	The expression levels of @GENE$ [ @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ] [ 42 , 43 ] , @GENE$ [ @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ] [ 44 , 45 ] and @GENE$ [ @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ] [ 46 , 47 ] were analyzed by Rotor - Gene 3000 ( Corbett Research , Sydney , Australia ) (	1
500	The @GENE$ of eukaryotic cells is mostly modified by methylation and interacts with various @GENE$ such as @GENE$ [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]	1
501	Figure 6 shows that @GENE$ did not hydrolyze methylated or @GENE$ when the activity of @GENE$ was , 1	1

503	This result indicates that @GENE$ in the nucleus was protected from @GENE$ because @GENE$ is mostly methylated and histone - bound	1
504	, @GENE$ in SCH07072 cells are expressed at lower working concentrations than we tested in our in vitro analysis shown in Figure 6 .	1
505	Analysis of variance testing revealed a number of statistically significant age and gender differences	1
506	On the ' Justification ' sub - scale , female respondents scored significantly higher than males [ F = 11	1

509	With respect to age , older respondents ( > 65 yrs ) indicated greater agreement that use of quarantine is justified than did the young ( 18 - 35 yrs ) [ F = 4	1

518	Third , the @DISEASE$ policy context represents a policy arena where certain groups engage in " behaviors " that might conflict with the overall goal of controlling @DISEASE$	1
519	Vested interests are more noticeable than in other health policy areas since different professional groups coexist in the @DISEASE$ policy arena and there is substantial profit to be made from selling antibiotics [ 29 , 30 ]	1
520	In Singapore , vested interests were mentioned among pharmaceutical companies in marketing for higher sales of their antibiotics for their own profits ; among private practitioners as they make substantial profits when dispensing antibiotics ; and among some veterinarians who prescribed antibiotics even when not clinically needed	1
521	Our previous research in other settings ( i	1
522	e	1
523	, Pakistan and Cambodia ) also suggested several considerations and vested interests around antibiotic use which can hinder the control of @DISEASE$ in the human and animal health sectors [ 29 , 30 ]	1
524	For example , it was reported that among doctors there are monetary incentives to prescribe certain antibiotics as these are often negotiated with pharmaceutical companies	1
525	It was also recounted that a large proportion of the income at hospital level and in pharmacies comes from prescribing antibiotics and as a result it might be difficult to introduce stewardship programs to curb their prescription	1
526	While these reports were present in Cambodia and Pakistan , they were absent in Singapore	1
527	Monetary incentives were not mentioned that often by our participants and were absent at hospital level .	1
528	This study was based on data from a prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 2010 to May 2013	1
529	All patients admitted to the medical ICU of Asan Medical Center , a 2 , 700 - bed tertiary care university - affiliated hospital in Seoul , Republic of Korea , with suspected severe @DISEASE$ were prospectively identified and monitored until discharged [ 14 ]	1
530	The data collected included patient demographics , underlying diseases or conditions , illness severity scores including Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) , type of @DISEASE$ , laboratory data including microbiological tests , length of ICU stay , and outcome	1
531	The prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed	1
532	This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study	1
533	All patients information was anonymized and deidentified prior to analysis .	1
534	Even though the insertions of the @GENE$ have different breakpoints from the @GENE$ , they are very close so it was possible to design assays for the @GENE$ and @GENE$ events utilizing a common set of primers within the @GENE$ ( Figure 1 )	1
535	When used in conjunction with primers for the plant sequence at the border of each event , they are able to detect each event ( Figure 2 )	1
536	Since they have 50 % of @GENE$ in common , it was important to determine whether there was any cross reaction between the assays	1
537	Specificity of the two assays was tested using @GENE$ for each event	1
538	No cross - reaction between the two targets was observed ( Figure 2 ) .	1
539	@DISEASE$ ( HCV ) was a member of Flaviviridae family virus , and seven major genotypes ( Genotype 1 [UNK] 7a ) have been identified with distinct regional distribution patterns	1
540	@DISEASE$ is a major cause of @DISEASE$ worldwide , and @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ has increasingly become the leading indication for @DISEASE$ ( LT )	1
541	It has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by HCV RNA detection using the poly@GENE$ hain reaction occurs almost universally [ 1 ]	1
542	The natural history of @DISEASE$ reinfection is substantially changed after LT with accelerated rate of @DISEASE$ recurrence of 8 - 44 % in 5 - 7 years [ 2 ]	1
543	It has been pointed out that HCV reinfects the liver graft at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ]	1
544	The virus source is attributed to the blood itself with a high probability [ 4 ] .	1
545	In many cases , infection by extra - cellular pathogens has been shown to alter @GENE$ activity in order to facilitate the survival of pathogens or host	1
546	As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens , @GENE$ activation is required for resistance to a variety of @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
547	However , many viruses such as @DISEASE$ , exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through κB response elements located @GENE$ 2 ]	1

551	The autoimmune aspects of @DISEASE$ have recently been reviewed [ 118 ]	1
552	Self - antigen responses to a variety of targets have actually been well described in @DISEASE$	1

558	Cells were stained with @GENE$ , as indicated for 15 min at 22 ° C , then washed thrice with dPBS , and fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA )	1
559	Data were collected with a BD LSR Fortessa X - 20 flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software	1

561	Z - stack images ( seven images separated by 1 μm ) were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser - scanning confocal microscope at × 40 objective magnification then compressed into a maximum intensity projection with accompanying software	1
562	For each region of each mouse , three to six images were taken from two different sagittal sections spaced at least 50 μm apart	1
563	The number of DAPI - positive nuclei also positive for @GENE$ and @GENE$ were counted by an individual blinded to the conditions .	1
564	@GENE$ were edited , assembled and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm in Geneious Prime ( Biomatters Ltd	1
565	, Auckland , New Zealand ) ( although alignment was uncontroversial with no gaps needed )	1
566	Sequences were translated in MegaX , and amino acid substitutions compared to the ICTV reference FPV sequence ( FVP - 3 Genbank accession no	1
567	EU659111 ) were identified	1
568	To determine the evolutionary history of the outbreak sequences from Australia , New Zealand and Dubai , we performed a phylogenetic analysis including these sequences and representative @GENE$ of FPV and CPV taken from GenBank	1
569	In addition , we included an @GENE$ sequence obtained from tissues of a healthy feral cat from Tasmania , Australia , sampled in 2010 ( Genbank accession no	1
570	MN603976 ) , for comparison	1
571	This resulted in a total data set of 205 sequences , 1774 nt in length	1
572	Phylogenetic analysis of these was performed using the PhyML program [ 13 ] and employing the GTR + I + Γ model of nucleotide substitution and a combination of Nearest - Neighbor Interchange ( NNI ) and Sub - tree Pruning & Re - grafting ( SPR ) branch swapping	1
573	Nodal support was assessed using SH - like branch support	1
574	Finally , the five CPV sequences included were used as an outgroup clade to root the tree .	1

578	These latter five markers of @DISEASE$ are secreted in the blood and show consistent changes with the increasing stage of @DISEASE$ when compared with the markers used in the FibroTest and enhanced @DISEASE$ ( ELF ) , Hepascore and FIBROSpect tests	1
579	In the present study , the levels of apolipop@GENE$ d in the progression of @DISEASE$ from @DISEASE$ to @DISEASE$	1
580	Therefore , further studies , with a larger number of samples , are required in order to better establish the@GENE$ recursor as a potential biomarker for @DISEASE$ progression .	1
581	Post - translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation are common molecular targets of conflict between viruses and their hosts	1
582	However , the role of other post - translational modifications , such as ADPribosylation , in host - virus interactions is less well characterized	1
583	ADP - ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the @GENE$	1
584	The majority of the 17 @GENE$ are poorly characterized	1
585	However , one @GENE$ , @GENE$ , has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive ( diversifying ) selection in primates	1
586	Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic ' arms races ' with @GENE$	1
587	To identify additional @GENE$ that may be involved in host - virus interactions , we performed evolutionary analyses on all @GENE$ to search for signatures of rapid evolution	1
588	Contrary to expectations that most @GENE$ are involved in ' housekeeping ' functions , we found that nearly one - third of @GENE$ are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection	1
589	We identified a @GENE$ of @GENE$ , a component of @GENE$ , to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages , suggesting this region serves as an important host - pathogen specificity interface	1
590	We also found positive selection of @GENE$ , 14 and 15 , the only three @GENE$ that contain both @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
591	@GENE$ uniquely recognize , and in some cases can reverse , protein mono - ADP - ribosylation , and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the @GENE$	1
592	Furthermore , @GENE$ and @GENE$ have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution , consistent with recurrent gene innovation	1
593	Together with previous studies that implicated several @GENE$ in immunity , as well as those that demonstrated a role for @GENE$ in host immune evasion , our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition , recognition and removal of ADP - ribosylation is a critical , underappreciated currency in host - virus conflicts .	1
594	Codon usage can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequency , which differs greatly among organisms	1
595	Specifically , after accounting for dinucleotide biases , the proportion of codon usage bias explained by mutation pressure often increases , as seen in human RNA viruses [ 25 ]	1
596	Our study revealed that CpG and the eight @GENE$ are notably deficient in ORFs of 48 @GENE$	1
597	The explanation for the @DISEASE$ is immunologic escape	1
598	A high CpG content may be detrimental to small DNA ( or RNA ) viruses , as unmethylated CpGs are recognized by the host ' s innate immune system ( Toll @GENE$ a pathogen signature [ 32 ]	1
599	As with verte@GENE$ hy@GENE$  face a high chance of mutation at CpGs , that would result in a reduction of this dinucleotide [ 9 , 33 ]	1
600	We found that DVPVs and live attenuated virus of genotype 1 have lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide compare with wild viruses of polioviruses genotype 1	1
601	The most popular explanation for lower frequencies of CpG in ORFs @GENE$ PV @GENE$ at when OPV viruses turning into VDPV genotype 1 , a lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide maybe help VDPV out of the host immunity .	1
602	No amino acid changes were unique to the 2003 samples as compared to the 2009 / 10 outbreak samples from the Eureka area and further south ( Table 2 ) ; however distinctive nucleotide changes were present in the noncoding and @GENE$	1
603	Temporal and genetic data indicate that the outbreak began in south Humboldt Co	1
604	and spread north to Arcata and three amino acid changes characterized samples from Arcata area and further north ( Table 2 )	1
605	Whether or not these genetic changes contributed to the explosive increase in @DISEASE$ that occurred primarily in Arcata during 2009 would require further study ( Fig	1
606	2 ) .	1

611	For example , a pseudoknot - free structure has level 1 , and an @GENE$ has level 2	1
612	In another example , when representing the secondary structure in dot bracket format , the number of different brackets used to represent the structure is the level of the structure	1
613	@GENE$ can handle structures up to level 3	1
614	• scoring model : The energy model used to produce posterior probabilities for each @GENE$ is called " scoring model "	1
615	@GENE$ has 3 different @GENE$ models , namely " @GENE$ " , " McCaskill " and " @GENE$ "	1
616	• refining parameters : The procedure of recalculating the base pair probabilities based on the original prediction results is referred to as " refining parameters "	1

618	According to the findings of this study nurses have various unmet needs when they are doing their job	1
619	Participants expressed the need for special support from the management	1
620	They were in need of adequate supplies of specialized protective N95 masks , in - service training , workshops , proper equipment , and a daily diet for @DISEASE$ nurses	1
621	A study by Sodeify et al	1
622	[ 30 ] revealed that poor working conditions , lack of resources , special managerial support from the hospitals in South Africa were the reasons why nurses left South Africa to go and work abroad .	1
623	They must ensure procurement of good quality personal protective materials such as N95 respiratory masks , gloves , and aprons and also follow their usage protocol .	1
624	In this example , method 3 of Iterative HFold outperforms the other methods	1
625	Because the input structure @GENE$ consists of just one @GENE$ , method 1 ( @GENE$ ) outputs a pseudoknot - free structure containing @GENE$	1

684	Molecular Sciences Review B Cells and Antibodies in @DISEASE$ 	1
685	We hypothesized that bacterial infection might indeed be an independent inflammatory stimulus in persistent preschool @DISEASE$ , and chose to study a selected group of patients without @DISEASE$ .	1
686	Estimating R 0 from Initial Epidemic Growth Rate	1
687	Thirty - three children , 12 girls and 21 boys with a median age of 10 months ( range 4 - 38 m ) , were assessed because of unexplained persistent @DISEASE$ despite ICS therapy	1
688	Administrated ICS dosages ranged from 100 - 500 mcg fluticasone daily or equivalent , with a variable treatment duration of 1 - 10 months	1
689	Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the study population with respect to allergy and reflux testing results , and familial and environmental risk factors for @DISEASE$	1
690	Only 7 of 13 ( 53	1
691	8 % ) children suffering from @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , were treated for @DISEASE$ prior to FOB + BAL .	1
692	We present our findings under five main themes identified from analysis of participants ' responses	1
693	The first theme examines the policy context and discusses whether @DISEASE$ as a policy issue is a priority in Singapore	1
694	The second theme discusses the level of @DISEASE$ awareness among policymakers , professionals , and the general population	1
695	The third and fourth theme discusses the perceived facilitators and challenges to combat @DISEASE$ in the Singaporean context	1
696	Finally , the fifth theme reflects on the reported strategies to increase awareness and combat @DISEASE$ based on participants ' perceptions .	1
697	As shown in Figure 2A , which pertains to pseudoknotted structures of the HK - PK data set , when provided with ≈ 1 % of the @GENE$ structure as input , Iterative HFold ' s bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measures has higher accuracy than those of HFold	1
698	Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90 % of @GENE$ is available , after which HFold is more accurate	1
699	Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about @GENE$ is known because it can add both pseudoknot - free and @GENE$	1
700	In particular , using methods 3 and 4 ( see Section ' Iterative HFold ' ) Iterative HFold first finds a low energy @GENE$ that includes the given input structure ( by extending the stems of the given structure ) , and then adds @GENE$ to further lower the energy of the overall structure	1
701	However , when the vast majority of @GENE$ of @GENE$ are provided as input , @GENE$ dominates as it keeps the @GENE$ of the input structure , thereby often adding @GENE$ of G small	1
702	When 100 % of @GENE$ is provided as input , HFold ' s bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval is ( 85	1
703	74 % , 91	1
704	87 % ) , compared with ( 79	1
705	36 % , 87	1

708	oils , El - Ghorab et al	1
709	( 2010 ) [ 79 ] reported almost similar trends in both methods	1
710	Cuminum cyminum , mainly constituted by cuminal , γ - terpinene , pinocarveol , , carotol , α - pinene , sabinene , β - terpineol and linalool , presented the best activity .	1

717	The superoxide anion scavenging activity of Portuguese Thymus oils were evaluated by the enzymatic @GENE$ system [ 53 ]	1
718	From the 28 essential oils evaluated , only Thymus zygis ssp	1
719	sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in diferent places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity > 50 %	1
720	In Thymus zygis ssp	1
721	sylvestris prevailed thymol or carvacrol , whereas in Thymus capitellatus oils , borneol and 1 , 8 - cineole dominated	1
722	Such results seem to indicate that the phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion , as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging [ 53 ] .	1
723	The selection of the receptor destroyer @GENE$ for this study is motivated by its following properties	1
724	@GENE$ belongs to the @GENE$ of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from @GENE$	1
725	Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from @GENE$ in order to enable the virus budding	1
726	Moreover , it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces	1
727	In particular , since variations in the @GENE$ can lead to the evolution of more potent strains , studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential .	1
728	The use of models in epidemiology dates back almost a century , and while traditional models have often been highly successful in explaining observed dynamics [ 17 , 20 , 28 , 29 , 41 ] , our results show that within a strict management setting , epidemiological details can make a crucial difference	1
729	Although a body of theoretical work [ 25 , 26 , 30 ] has demonstrated the importance of incorporating realistic distributions of latent and infectious periods into models of endemic disease , few studies have considered the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease [ 42 ] .	1
730	We conducted the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of risk factors of @DISEASE$ globally	1
731	In addition to the previously suggested risk factors , occupational exposure and contact with pigs or pork without skin protection , we identified the ingestion of food with a high risk of contamination with S	1
732	suis serotype 2 to be an important risk factor for @DISEASE$	1
733	To investigate eating habits as a risk factor of @DISEASE$ , we focused on potential ' ' high risk ' ' dishes common in Vietnam	1
734	These include fresh or under - cooked blood , tonsils , tongue , stomach , intestines and uterus	1
735	Such food items typically are undercooked when eaten as a main dish ( as opposed to as components of well cooked main dishes such as rice or noodle soups ) , as was generally the case in our patients	1
736	By multivariate analysis , we demonstrated that eating these ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to admission was a significant risk factor for this infection	1
737	Eating habits were also confirmed as a risk factor during a relatively small @DISEASE$ outbreak in Thailand , associated with consumption of fresh pig blood	1
738	[ 12 ]	1
739	Eating pork was not associated with @DISEASE$ cases in a matched case - control study conducted during the outbreak in Sichuan province in 2005 [ 13 ]	1

759	Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples according to date and geography ( Figure 3 )	1
760	The sequence data obtained from samples collected between 1995 - 1996 differed from the 2003 - 10 samples by four amino acid changes in the @GENE$ ; L12Q , D427G , P485L , and S501P , and each involved a change in polarity ( Table 2 )	1
761	One amino acid change , G428S , characterized samples obtained from the southern region versus from the northern region	1
762	Samples from Arcata were also defined by nucleotide changes and samples from the southern region of Humboldt Co	1
763	, Loleta , Fortuna , and Hydesville , grouped together as did most of the Eureka samples ( Figure 3 , Figure S5 )	1
764	The exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka , which consistently grouped with the Arcata samples ( Figures 1 and 2 )	1
765	Figure S6 )	1
766	Skunk 2 from 1995 differed from all other samples at site 69 where a Y was present rather than an H ( Table 2 ) .	1
767	A previously mentioned , @DISEASE$ is a complex disease that may result from interaction between several infectious agents	1
768	However , most epidemiological studies have focussed on monitoring the effect of only one pathogen in the occurrence of this disease , and there is inadequate information concerning other relevant enteric pathogens such as viruses and parasites	1
769	Some investigations of mixed infections in @DISEASE$ showed that rotavirus was considered to be an important enteric pathogen in weaned piglets with a prevalence of 77	1
770	5 % , followed by E	1
771	coli , @DISEASE$ , sapovirus and Cryptosporidium parvum with prevalence of 55 , 10 , 2	1
772	5 and 2	1
773	5 % respectively [ 48 ]	1
774	In addition , infection by the @DISEASE$ ( PRRSv ) results in an impairment of the immune response of piglets , permitting ETEC to cause a @DISEASE$ leading to death [ 49 ]	1
775	However , these data were reported more than 10 years ago and are unlikely to reflect the current epidemiologic situation .	1
776	@DISEASE$ ( HCV ) is a small - enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family	1
777	Since first identified in 1989 , @DISEASE$ has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide	1
778	Mostly @DISEASE$ has a uniform natural history , from @DISEASE$ to the development of @DISEASE$	1
779	The current therapy for @DISEASE$ consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin	1
780	On the@GENE$ E$ is also the leading indication for liver transplantation	1
781	However , posttransplant @DISEASE$ re - infection of the graft has been reported to be universal	1
782	Furthermore , the graft after @DISEASE$ re - infection often results in accelerated progression to @DISEASE$	1
783	In addition , treatment of recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies	1
784	Taken together , poor outc@GENE$ DISEASE$ re - infection , regardless of grafts or recipients , poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons	1
785	The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding @DISEASE$ re - infection after transplant : risk factors , current therapeutics for @DISEASE$ in different stages of liver transplantation , cellular function of HCV proteins , and molecular mechanisms@GENE$ 	1
786	Hopefully , this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome .	1
787	The association between maternal immune activation ( MIA ) and subsequent @DISEASE$ in offspring has become increasingly recognized , with both epidemiological evidence and research findings in various animal models [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]	1
788	MIA against viral or bacterial infections influences the developing fetal central nervous system ( CNS ) , and increases the risk of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) later in life [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]	1
789	It has been suggested that MIA has a strong impact on microglial development , and @DISEASE$ disturbance disrupts neurogenesis , neuronal migration , and myelination , thus leading to consequent @DISEASE$ of the offspring 2	1
790	Based on these findings , MIA is believed to be a disease primer 1	1
791	It has also been reported that MIA and MIA - induced fetal neuroinflammation stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and disturbances in pro - inflammatory cytokine production in the fetal brain@GENE$ eported to Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure	1
792	Since MIA has been considered to be a cause of @DISEASE$ in offspring , including @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ , we subsequently evaluated the effect of LPS and maternal administration of HW on short - term memory , sociability , social novelty , and sensorimotor gating	1
793	As shown in Fig	1
794	2A , spontaneous alternation was markedly reduced in the LPS group than in the Control group ( p < 0	1
795	001 ) in the Y - maze test , which is indicative of impaired short - term memory	1
796	Treatment with H 2 significantly attenuated the @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( p < 0	1
797	05 )	1
798	There was no difference in the total number of arm entries among the three groups ( Control , 24	1

805	Following this , the peptides within the V8 and H8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the T cell epitope specificities	1
806	We subdivided the peptides from H8 and V8 in four new pools each containing five peptides ( H8	1

809	1 , V8	1
810	2 )	1
811	In addition , we separately tested the two 15 - mer peptides # 89 and # 90 , which were shared between pools H8 and V8	1

826	Yet , the stimulation with subpools V8	1

834	Of note , the stimulations with the 15 - mer peptides # 89 ( N 353 - 367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK ) or # 90 ( N 357 - 371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP ) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of IFN - γ producing cells ( mean levels about 71 - 107 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes ) in mice that had been vaccinated with MVA - MERS - N by both immunization routes ( Figure 4b )	1
835	CD8 + T cells purified from mice receiving non - recombinant MVA or mock vaccine ( PBS ) did not produce @GENE$ following stimulation with peptides from subpools @GENE$ 1 - H8	1
836	2 and with peptides # 89 and # 90	1
837	When checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools , we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides # 89 and # 90 were part of the subpools V8	1
838	2 and H8	1
839	2 , whereas these peptides were absent in V8	1
840	1 and H8	1
841	1	1
842	This data suggested that the overlapping 15 - mer peptides # 89 and # 90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS - CoV N - specific CD8 + T cell responses .	1
843	Interestingly , elevated @GENE$ was shown in the spinal cord but not brainstem or muscle of infected mice ( untreated group vs	1
844	isotypetreated group )	1
845	Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated @GENE$ expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of @GENE$ in the muscle ( Fig	1
846	7C )	1
847	These @GENE$ downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral - induced pathogenesis , and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues .	1
848	The iLIR @ viral database is a web resource freely available to the academic community at http : / / ilir	1

850	Various functionalities are accessible under specific menus	1
851	The ' Classification ' menu gives access to the complete list of putative @GENE$ in @GENE$	1
852	Two virus taxonomic systems have been used : the nomenclature used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) to name the species , genus and families of each of the viruses cited in the database , and the Baltimore classification system that groups viruses depending on their genome and kind of replication ( @GENE$ , dsRNA , @GENE$ , ssRNA and reverse - transcribing viruses ) ( see Methods )	1
853	63 , 64 For each specific family or group of viruses , the data are presented in a table containing ( i ) the clickable UniProtKB accession number of the protein , ( ii ) the information related to the @GENE$ ( position , sequence , PSSM score , if the pattern is recognized as an @GENE$ or @GENE$ and the presence of the motif in an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ) , ( iii ) the name of the protein and ( iv ) the name of the species	1
854	For some genera , no @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) could be identified ; for accuracy in the classification , these are listed but appear in red ( Fig	1
855	1 ) .	1
856	All data was entered into a Microsoft Access database and transferred to IBM SPSS 21	1
857	0 for statistical analysis	1
858	Data was analysed descriptively ( percentages , or median with inter - quartile range , IQR )	1
859	Comparisons between groups were assessed for significance ( p < 0	1

861	) which is quickly converted to hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , spontaneously , or by the enzyme @GENE$	1
862	Hydrogen peroxide can then also be reduced by transition metal ions generating the hydroxyl radical ( HO • ) , one of the strongest oxidizing agents that can rapidly react with polyunsaturated fatty acids , resulting the production of peroxyl radicals ( ROO • )	1
863	Peroxide hydrogen can also oxidise halide ions ( Cl - ) to hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , which is a strong oxidant that can react with amines producing chloramines , some of them being very toxic [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
864	These radicals are commonly known as ROS ( reactive oxygen species )	1
865	Nevertheless and during an inflammatory process , there is also the generation of other free radicals named RNS ( reactive nitrogen species )	1
866	Nitric oxide ( • NO ) and peroxynitrite anion ( ONOO - ) are two examples of this sort of radicals	1
867	Nitric oxide is produced in large quantities by the inducible @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in activated macrophages and neutrophils during defence and immunological reactions	1
868	However this reactive species can also exerts its toxicity by generating the peroxynitrite anion after reacting with the superoxide anion radical [ 22 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .	1
869	RT - PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm virus accumulation in the three 3D8 scFv TG lines after PRV inoculation	1
870	Figure 8A shows that @GENE$ was detected in the muscle and brain of @DISEASE$ , STG69 , and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms	1
871	Immunohistochemical analysis w@GENE$ tibody supported the viral gene expression data ; only @DISEASE$ mice with a high infection rate had Purkinje layer cells from the brain that stained dark brown after diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) staining ( Figure 8B ) .	1
872	@GENE$ infiltrate the CNS during acute @DISEASE$ and are retained together with both virus - specific and SR T cells during persistence ( 13 , 19 )	1
873	However , their role in regulating endogenously primed T cell populations of viral , and more importantly , SR specificity has not been addressed	1
874	To specifically investigate a function of Foxp3@GENE$ g @DISEASE$ persistence , we infected DEREG mice , in which DT treatment abrogated the vast majority of @GENE$ under homeostatic conditions but retained a minor fraction thereby circumventing @DISEASE$ ( 22 )	1
875	We first confirmed that transgene expression in DEREG mice does not alter @DISEASE$ pathogenesis compared to syngeneic WT mice	1
876	Clinical disease onset and progression , viral clearance , and CNS inflammatory responses were similar between the two groups ( data not shown )	1
877	The extent and severity of @DISEASE$ within spinal cords was also not altered ( data not shown )	1
878	Moreover , high fluorescent intensity of eGFP expressed un@GENE$ ontrol of the Foxp3 promoter in@GENE$ bled a distinct separation of the Foxp3 + population among CD4 + T cells compared to direct intracellular Foxp3 - staining @GENE$ mice ( Figure 1A )	1
879	Most importantly , no significant differences in the frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells during @DISEASE$ were found comparing the two groups ( data not shown )	1
880	Validation of Foxp3 expression in DE@GENE$ ce thus facilitated characterization of Foxp3 + Treg kinetics @GENE$ urse of infection	1
881	The frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + cells remained stable at ~ 15 % within CLN at all time points ( data not shown )	1
882	By contrast , within both brain and spinal cord , Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells peaked at day 7 p	1
883	i	1
884	and then rapidly decreased at day 10 p	1
885	i	1
886	( Figure 1B )	1
887	However , while the frequency of Foxp3 + Tregs was main@GENE$  % within the brain after day 10 p	1

889	( Figure 1B ) , a sustained rebound was observed in spinal cords after day 14 p	1
890	i	1
891	during chronic infection ( Figure 1B )	1
892	The sustained increase in the fraction of Foxp3 + T at later time points , specifically within the spinal cord , was not attributed to viral replication , as infectious virus is cleared by day 14 p	1
893	i	1
894	, and viral RNA levels continuously decline after day 10 p	1

899	( 12 ) rather implicates that the second wave of Tregs is pathology - driven and functions to limit emerging SR CD4 + T cell responses .	1
900	We now discuss two aspects of the statistical model for these daily chest radiograph counts : distribution and scale	1
901	Although the outcome variable of interest is counts , like other researchers in the field [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] , we model the data using a Gaussian rather than Poisson process	1
902	The reasons are : ( i ) A normal approximation to the Poisson random variable is reasonable when the mean number of radiograph counts is large , as in this study ; ( ii ) Gaussian time series models are easier to fit , diagnose , and interpret ; ( iii ) The theory for filter - based methods commonly used for detecting the outbreak signature in such data is well developed for Gaussian processes	1
903	In some applications , count data are transformed when Gaussian models are used	1
904	Transformations , such as log or square root , are used to parameterize multiplicative models or to stabilize the variance	1
905	We use the original scale instead of transforming the data , like other researchers in the area , for ease of interpretation	1
906	This is especially important when we analyze filter - based detection methods in this article	1
907	For the same reason , we do not model the number of chest radiographs per daily ED visits ( i	1
908	e	1
909	, the proportion of radiographs )	1
910	The filter - based theory , allows us to directly assess the effect of additive stochastic outbreaks signatures upon the radiograph series .	1
911	The Annotation Support Server also provides the ability to take as input a set of functional roles ( in the controlled vocabulary established by the subsystem collection ) and to produce a detailed estimate of which subsystems are represented by those functional roles	1
912	That is , one can also use the server to develop a metabolic reconstruction based on the functional roles that have been assigned to the @GENE$ .	1
913	In other work , it has been suggested that whilst endogenous @GENE$ could co - localise with @DISEASE$ R@GENE$ - LC3 showed significantly reduced co - localisation [ 56 ]	1
914	This may provide an explanation for some of the earlier experimental discrepancies	1

916	In addition , although the absence of the complete autophagy pathway due to a la@GENE$  ATG7 did not alter MHV replication , reduced expressi@GENE$ f LC3 by RNAi did significantly reduce virus replication	1
917	Furthermore , viral protein expression could be rescued in the presen@GENE$ G120A [ 56 ]	1

921	However , under normal conditions , the ERAD machinery must be regulated to prevent premature removal of proteins before they have been folded [ 59 ]	1
922	During ERAD tuning , parts of the ERAD machinery are removed from the @GENE$ somes to down regulate the pathway [ 57 , 58 , 6@GENE$  LC3I is recruit@GENE$ som@GENE$ SEL1L [ 57 ] and possibly acts@GENE$ otein [ 60 ]	1
923	This work has highlighted a rol@GENE$ r LC3 as part of the ERAD tuning pathway , but not autophagy , in the replication of MHV	1
924	Whether this pathway is involved in the replication cycles of other coronaviruses remains to be determined .	1
925	Over the past few years , numerous viruses have been detected in bats and these viruses seldom cause any overt disease ( with the exception of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) [ 1 , 16 , 37 ]	1
926	Detection of virus and absence of disease have led researchers to suggest that bats are likely the reservoirs of these viruses	1
927	Asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( Middle Eastern @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) ) , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ]	1
928	For a species to be a viral reservoir , the virus needs to persist in the population	1
929	Two probable ways in which this can happen are ( 1 ) virus infection and clearing from infected individuals is an ongoing process and introduction of naïve individuals maintains the virus in the population and ( 2 ) individuals infected with the virus are able to maintain the virus in the form of a persistent infection	1
930	Although either or both of these possibilities may influence the bat - virus relationship , there is considerable evidence for the maintenance of some viruses in bat populations by continued , low - level persistence .	1
931	The @GENE$ functions as the modulation of viral RNA replication via interacting with @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 8 ]	1
932	In addition , the @GENE$ can inhibit the @GENE$ - mediated translation through binding to the @GENE$ located in the @GENE$	1
933	A previous study showed that the @GENE$ - interacting @GENE$ were screened using @GENE$ analysis , and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription , protein degradation , protein folding and metabolism [ 26 ]	1
934	Recently , @GENE$ has been identified to interact with the @GENE$ and enhance viral RNA replication [ 27 ]	1
935	In this study , @GENE$ was identified as a novel @GENE$ and a negative regulator of CSFV replication	1
936	@GENE$ had not been identified in the previous study , probably due to the different cell types ( endothelial cells vs	1
937	primary macrophages ) used to construct the @GENE$ [ 26 ]	1
938	We showed that @GENE$ and @GENE$ were colocalized in the cytoplasm	1
939	As @GENE$ is the component of the @GENE$ , whether @GENE$ is also localized in the @GENE$ needs further investigation .	1
940	The study population was predominately male between 15 and 84 years of age , of them , approximately 84 % of participants were between the ages of 20 and 59 years	1
941	The participants were enrolled from the governorates of Abu Arish , Al Aridah , Al Darb , Al Aydabi , Baish , Dhamad , Fifa , Jazan , Sabya , and Samtah	1
942	A small percentage ( 16	1
943	9 % ) of participants reported themselves to be semi - nomadic , with possible movement outside of the Jazan region	1
944	Nearly half ( 44 % ) of participants were from the Jazan Governorate	1
945	Among participants , 25 % reported some form of contact with domestic animals including camels , cattle , horse , goats , or sheep and 17 % reported daily contact with domestic camels during the 12 months to enrollment ( see Table S1 ) .	1

947	The general procedures were the same as those for the Ni - NTA columns , although the buffers used in the @GENE$ columns were different	1
948	PBS solution ( pH 7	1
949	4 ) was used for equilibration	1
950	After the sample was loaded , the same PBS solution was used to wash the column	1
951	Finally , the glutathione solution ( 50 mM Tris - HCL , 10 mM reduced glutathione ) was used to elute the protein of interest	1
952	All purified @GENE$ igens were found to be > 90 % pure based on SDS / polyacrylamide gel analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining	1
953	Eluents with high OD 280 were collected into a membrane bag and dialysis was performed overnight at 4 [UNK] C in a buffer ( PBS buffer )	1
954	Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method@GENE$ bumin as the standard .	1
955	In the current study , we examined the effects of the cell cycle status on EV - D68 viral replication , as well as the impact of EV - D68 virus on the host cell cycle	1
956	Our data show that EV - D68 replication is integrally associated with the host cell cycle , though the pattern of regulation differs distinctly from that of EV - A71	1
957	These results further increase the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential target for the treatment and prevention of @DISEASE$ .	1
958	Yes .	1
959	We have analyzed a publicly available @DISEASE$ steady - state , whole - lung transcriptome data set generated from 51 @DISEASE$ strains ( Alberts et al	1
960	2011 ) to interrogate the molecular phenotype of the pulmonary myocardium	1

968	Meanings were organized into themes , and themes evolved into theme clusters and eventually into theme categories .	1
969	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a @GENE$ that plays a regulatory role in the expression of many important genes of inflammation ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ )	1
970	The human monocyte cell line THP - 1 is often used as a model for tissue macrophages	1
971	Zhou et al	1
972	( 2007 ) [ 149 ] showed that 1 , 8 - cineole inhibited the @GENE$ synthesis and nuclear localization induced by LPS in THP - 1 cells but did not affect the LPS - induced @GENE$ expression in nuclei	1
973	Therefore , the authors concluded that 1 , 8 - cineole may preferentially block the effect of @GENE$ by inhibiting the synthesis of @GENE$ and preventing @GENE$ nuclear internalization instead of @GENE$ inhibition [ 149 ]	1
974	Some authors reported that α - pinene clearly inhibited the translocation of @GENE$ into nuclei in LPS - stimulated THP - 1 cells , through the increase of expression of @GENE$ [ 150 , 151 ] .	1
975	The anti - inflammatory activities of @GENE$ are partially effectuated by inhibition of @GENE$	1
976	@GENE$ are able to attenuate @GENE$ function either by interfering with the transcription activating capacity of the @GENE$ or by regulating genes that suppress the activation of @GENE$	1
977	By physical interaction with components of the @GENE$ , @GENE$ impairs binding of @GENE$ to the DNA and subsequent activation of @GENE$	1
978	Secondly , @GENE$ activation results in increased expression of @GENE$ , the @GENE$ that prevents the transfer of @GENE$ to the nucleus [ 134 , 135 ]	1
979	On the other hand , Inoue et al	1
980	( 2000 ) [ 136 ] consider that @GENE$ expression is regulated by a negative feedback loop , mediated through @GENE$ , especially in macrophages , indicating that @GENE$ participates in cell type - specific control of @GENE$ expression .	1
981	The role played by markets in disease transmission may have a significant effect upon the predictability of the sampling methods	1
982	When markets do not contribute to disease transmission , only a very small percentage of nodes needs to be sampled using the TNS method	1
983	However , when we make the assumption that all batches on a market are well mixed , a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled	1
984	We also find that in this case , the RMS method requires sampling of a much smaller percentage of movements than the nonmarket scenario	1
985	This is unsurprising - markets represent very highly connected nodes in the network , and therefore when they are explicitly included in the model , an RMS approach will preferentially sample movements to and from these highly connected nodes	1
986	The model currently assumes that livestock do not stay overnight on markets , in line with Defra policy , and hence any infectious markets would become susceptible the following day	1
987	Should this not be the case , the role of markets in disease transmission may be slightly altered	1
988	Therefore , our results suggest that a more thorough , disease - specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context - specific optimal sampling strategies	1
989	However , our sensitivity analysis shows that TNS is the preferred sampling strategy for all studied transmission rates and infectious periods .	1
990	Next , the effect of @GENE$ protein on the expression of two @GENE$ - @GENE$ and @GENE$ was measured by performing real time quantitative RT - PCR of these @GENE$ in ORF2 expressing Huh7 cells , which were treated with TPA for 6 hours prior to RNA isolation	1
991	As expected , @GENE$ and @GENE$ transcript level was decreased in ORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells ( Figure 5D )	1
992	These experiments indicates that @GENE$ , by virtue of its ability to inhibit @GENE$ activity , suppress TPA induced @GENE$ and @GENE$ RNA synthesis .	1
993	Statistical analyses did not describe significant differences in virus load expressed as either genomic copies or TCID 50 among the different organs .	1
994	Post - mortem examinations and histological analyses were performed on all of the euthanized birds in experiments 1 and 2	1
995	Results from experiment 2 will be first presented , to mirror the progression of the disease through time .	1
996	@GENE$ can be used to identify a @GENE$ Since the expression of @GENE$ has previously been used as a marker for pulmonary myocardium ( Millino et al	1
997	2000 ; Mommersteeg et al	1
998	2007 ; Ye et al	1
999	2015 ) , we reasoned that genes with expression that correlated with @GENE$ expression ( trait ID 1422536 _ at , mean expression 11	1

1001	The top 100 transcripts that correlated with @GENE$ in the BXD whole - lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph	1

1008	5 and 0	1
1009	7 ( orange lines )	1
1010	( B ) The functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified	1
1011	All proteins except @GENE$ and @GENE$ had known roles in cardiac function including @GENE$ , regulation of @GENE$ assembly , ion transport , transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation , and hormone signaling .	1
1012	For immunohistochemical staining , unfixed frozen liver sections were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then incubated with blocking buffer ( 1 % @GENE$ in PBS ) for 30 min at room temperature	1
1013	Subsequently , the sections were incubated with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) for 2 h at room temperature	1
1014	After being washed with PBS , the sections were incubated with streptavidin - Alexa Fluor 488 ( Invitrogen )	1
1015	The nuclei were stained with 4 ' , 6diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI )	1
1016	Fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser microscope ( Laser scanning microscope 510 , Carl Zeiss ) .	1
1017	Various HCV transgenic mouse models have been developed and used to examine immune response to HCV expression and the effects of pathogenic @GENE$ on hepatocytes [ 4 , 16 , 17 ]	1
1018	However , these transgenic mice develop tolerance to the @GENE$ ; therefore , examining immune response to @GENE$ has been difficult .	1
1019	@GENE$ are known to regulate cell cycle progression ( Sherr , 1994 )	1
1020	To identify the key molecules and signaling pathways that may mediate the inhibition of cell entry into S phase by EV - D68 , we examined the protein expression profiles of host @GENE$ and @GENE$ by Western blotting of @DISEASE$ cells at 0 , 16 , 20 , 24 , and 28 h post - infection	1
1021	Among the mol@GENE$ s @GENE$ , CDK6@GENE$ yclinD ( which mediate cell cycle progression in G0 / G1 ; Massagué , 2004@GENE$ d CD@GENE$ clinE1 ( which mediate cell cycle transition from G0 / G1 to S phase ; Hinds et al	1
1022	, 1992 ) , the express@GENE$ f CDK6 was not changed , and the express@GENE$ clinE1 was increased at 24 h post - infecion ( Figure 3B ) , while all of them were significantly decreased in virus - infected cells as compared to mock - infected cells at 28 h post - infection ( Figures 3B , G )	1
1023	Furthermore@GENE$ 2 mRNA level was decreased by EV - D68 infection ; however , there were no significant differences between the virus and mockinfected gro@GENE$ n @GENE$ , @GENE$ ycl@GENE$ clinE1 mRNA levels ( Figure 3C )	1
1024	Therefore , EV - D68 infection inhibits host expression of s@GENE$ oteins , which is consistent with its ability to inhibit G0 / G1 to S phase entry , and the modulation is likely to occur transcriptional@GENE$ r CDK2 and post - transcriptional@GENE$ r @GENE$ , @GENE$ yclinD@GENE$ clinE1 .	1
1025	@GENE$ are often essential for viral replication , so we also evaluated whether EV - D68 might exert its host cell cycle regulatory function via its @GENE$	1
1026	Our results confirmed that the @GENE$ increases the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase by decreasing the expression of the @GENE$ and S phase related - cell cycle proteins @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , while @GENE$ decreases the percentage of cells in G2 / M phase by decreasing the expression of G2 / M - related proteins @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
1027	These findings raise the possibility that the @GENE$ and @GENE$ may function coordinately in the context of an EV - D68 infection to enhance the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 and increase the G0 / G1 to G2 / M ratio	1
1028	It is noted that @GENE$ of EV - A71 mediates cell cycle arrest at S phase , while @GENE$ of EV - D68 mediated cell cycle at G0 / G1 , although until now the detailed reason of the difference is not clear , it is speculated that @GENE$ of same amino acid sequence might bind with a same target which is responsible for the function of cell cycle arrest , while 172 of different amino acid sequence might bind other different factors which is responsible for different ability of cell cycle regulation , and this part will be investigated in the future .	1

1031	It has been postulated that PF and FeL may share a common pathomechanism ( molecular mimicry ) when they co - exist in the same cat [ 56 ] .	1
1032	In general , anti - Leishmania antibodies should always be evaluated by laboratories using serological methods validated in cats .	1
1033	In an effort to assess both the breadth of the effects conferred by treatment with a CpG - A and possible variability in the responses obtained in individual cats , the mRNA expression of ten genes relevant to early immune responses was measured in ODN 2216 stimulated PBMCs of fourteen cats divided in four different age groups ( group 1 : 10 weeks ( n = 4 ) , group 2 : 1	1
1034	5 years ( n = 4 ) , group 3 : 7 years ( n = 4 ) , group 4 : 14 years ( n = 2 ) )	1
1035	Only slight individual variability in gene induction was observed after 24 h stimulation of immune cells from adult cats ranging between 1	1
1036	5 and 14 years of age ( Figure 2B - D )	1
1037	Overall , the mRNA expression profile Figure 2D )	1
1038	Moreover , all individual @GENE$ subtypes tested were induced at similar levels in the cells of four adult cats from group 2 ( Figure 2E )	1
1039	Increased levels of @GENE$ were also measured in most individuals of groups 2 - 4 , with @GENE$ more systematically increased than @GENE$	1
1040	The cells from these cats indicated a typical Th1 orientation after stimulation , with enhanced transcription of @GENE$ in 9 / 10 and @GENE$ in 6 / 10 animals , together with absent or only low induction of @GENE$	1
1041	Stimulation of PBMCs with ODN 2216 also created an optimal environment for NK cell activity , as indicated by the increases in mRNA expression of the NK cell stimulator @GENE$ by up to 20 - fold and of the NK cell effector @GENE$ by up to 7 - fold	1
1042	The cells of those cats ( c08 , c09 , c12 ) that had most effectively proliferated ( Figure 1A ) and / or exhibited the strongest expression of @GENE$ ( Figure 1B - E ) following ODN 2216 stimulation also consistently expressed the highest mRNA levels of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
1043	PBMCs of cat c08 ( group 2 , Figure 1B ) were also by far most responsive to stimulation with ODN 2216	1
1044	When cells from kittens of group 1 were stimulated , higher individual variability was observed than in adult animals ( Figure 2A )	1
1045	The PBMCs of only 2 out of 4 cats from this group could be stimulated with ODN 2216 to increase mRNA expression of the tested genes	1
1046	In both individuals , not only the mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was enhanced at much lower levels than observed in adult cats but the overall immune response favored a Th2 direction , characterized by upregulated IL - 4 and downregulated IL - 12 mRNA levels ( Figure 2A ) .	1
1047	There are two very popular methods for monitoring lipid peroxidation : determination of conjugated dienes ( absorbance at 234 nm ) and the TBARS ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ) assay	1
1048	This method measures the malonaldehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition , which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid ( TBA )	1
1049	However , TBARS is representative of a rather late stage of lipid oxidation , when the oxidation substrate has undergone substantial transformation [ 29 ]	1
1050	There are other methods , including the determination of peroxide value , iodine value , chromatographic measurement of volatile compounds , formic acid measurement [ the Rancimat method in an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids ( formic acid ) produced during the auto - oxidation of lipids at 100 ºC or above ] [ 5 ] .	1
1051	In frame with the results of our in vitro experiments , the administration of ODN 2216 in vivo could promote an antiviral state in the domestic cat in the absence of adverse reactions	1
1052	Just as stimulated PBMCs exhibited high mRNA expression of @GENE$ and only a marginal increase in mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines @GENE$ and @GENE$ , treated cats showed significantly increased @GENE$ expression in their blood and lacked @DISEASE$ generally linked with administration of immunostimulatory molecules in vivo	1
1053	Additionally , although our in vivo studies included a limited number of cats , the strength of responses to ODN 2216 stimulation in vitro and in vivo for individual animals strongly correlated , indicating that individual sensitivity to stimulation most likely can be predicted with in vitro experiments	1
1054	Our data further show that a single subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 sufficed to induce the systemic presence of antiviral @GENE$ 36 h in the plasma of treated cats ; during this time , an increase of Mx express@GENE$  of at least 4 - fold in the blood of treated cats was indicative of significant inhibition of viral replication in vitro	1
1055	These observations support possible resistance to @DISEASE$ by ODN 2216 for several days , a phenomenon described already in mouse models [ 89 ] .	1
1056	We also investigated innate immune responses induced by @DISEASE$ infection of porcine NEC , and our data indicate a mild and delayed induction of the proinflammatory cyto@GENE$ L - @GENE$ L - 8 and undetectable levels of @GENE$ kines , su@GENE$ [UNK@GENE$ d TNF , contrasting wit@GENE$ okine responses induced by common @DISEASE$ ( 58 ) ( 59 ) ( 60 )	1
1057	As for IFN @GENE$ ich are important muco@GENE$ uced by respiratory epithelial cells , we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level , confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium , which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract	1
1058	This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on @DISEASE$ and by the observed induction o@GENE$ 1 , a potent negative regulator of th@GENE$ N pathway and consequently also of the expression o@GENE$ s ( 61 )	1
1059	This is in accordance with a report describin@GENE$ 1 induction during @DISEASE$ infection ( 36 ) .	1

1063	18 The ability of the consensus ZIKV @GENE$ ne to induce cellular and humoral immune responses in this mouse strain was investigated	1

1067	The serum was collected from immunised mice at days 0 , 14 , 21 , and 35 , and splenocytes were harvested from mice 1 week following the final immunisation ( day 35 )	1
1068	The splenocytes from vaccine - immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response as indicated by levels of SFU per 10 6 cells in an ELISpot assay ( Supplementary Figure S3A )	1
1069	The results from ELISA analysis , using rZIKV@GENE$ capture antigen , show detectable anti @GENE$ y 14 ( titres of ~ 1 : 1 , 000 ) and these levels were boosted with subsequent vaccinations with binding antibody titres reaching at least 1 : 100 , 000 ( Supplementary Figure S3B , C )	1
1070	By comparison , the PRNT 50 titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1 : 60 ( data not shown )	1
1071	The results indicate that IFNAR@GENE$  mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV @GENE$ ne are capable of generating anti - ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses supporting further study in this model of putative vaccine effects in a pathogenic challenge .	1

1076	Along with the antiviral property of their anti - HIV - 1 @GENE$ , Chaubey et a l	1
1077	and Tripathi et a l	1
1078	investigated the virucidal effect of their conjugates and their potential use as microbicide [ 92 , 94 ]	1
1079	They showed that pre - incubation of HIV - 1 virions with these molecules rendered them noninfectious and blocked further cell infection	1
1080	Two hypotheses may explain these results ( Figure 1 )	1
1081	The conjugates may have been able to enter the virion particles and bind to the @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
1082	The @GENE$ may also have altered or disrupted the viral envelope through the interaction of the @GENE$ moiety with the viral lipid bilayer , thereby inhibiting host cell infection	1
1083	The authors showed that brief exposure of virions to @GENE$ - PNA conjugates blocked endogenous reverse transcription within virion particles , arguing in favor of a virucidal effect due to the @GENE$ interaction with the @GENE$	1
1084	However , their work set the stage for exploring anti - HIV - 1 activity displayed by CPPs on their own	1
1085	CPPs share structural similarities and membrane - binding properties with another class of peptides : the antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) [ 31 ]	1
1086	AMPs are small peptides carrying basic and hydrophobic residues	1
1087	They are found in all living organisms	1
1088	Mainly produced by leukocytes and epithelial cells , they are major players in the innate immune response against infectious agents	1
1089	Interestingly , AMPs have been put forward as one potential class of novel antivirals	1
1090	Their antimicrobial activity has been reported against both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses , blocking viral infection in different ways [ 110 ] : they can directly inactivate the virion through disruption of its envelop or interaction with its @GENE$ ; they can act on infected cells possibly through interactions with @GENE$ resulting in alterations in cellsignaling pathways required for virus replication ; they can block the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome of the host cell , thereby interfering with viral replication ; finally , they can interact with and inhibit @GENE$ essential to the virus replication [ 111 ]	1
1091	In view of the similarities between CPPs and AMPs and of the reports of anti - HSV - 1 effects of some peptides , CPP ' s potential intrinsic antiviral activity undoubtedly deserves further investigation .	1

1104	On average , 31 % of over 15 - year olds smoke daily or occasionally in EU countries and the smoking figures are lower only in Finland ( 25 % ) , Sweden ( 25 % ) and Slovakia ( 22 % ) [ 21 ] .	1
1105	Dampness may also be created by condensation and may thus increase at higher ventilation rates	1
1106	Carbon monoxide is lethal at high exposure levels and more efficient dilution by higher ventilation may not be sufficient	1
1107	However , for all these pollutants the benefits of higher ventilation rates are calculated assuming the mass - balance for a constant source term .	1
1108	The input can be either copy - pasted or uploaded from a file	1
1109	@GENE$ accepts IDs from five databases ( Table 1 ) including GenBank ( gi or accession number ) and @GENE$ ( accession number or entry name ) that are automatically recognized in and extracted from the input data prepared in several formats : as part of tree ( ' newick ' and ' nexus ' ) and alignment ( ' fasta ' , ' msf ' , ' clustalw ' , ' nexus ' , ' phylip ' , ' mega ' and ' stockholm ' ) or supplied as a plain list ( Figure 2 )	1
1110	Examples of IDs , unique and non - unique , in alignment , tree , and plain list are available for testing purposes	1
1111	@GENE$ may accept input with non - unique IDs , e	1
1112	g	1
1113	@GENE$ accession number or @GENE$ name , that are most popular among researchers	1
1114	Since these IDs may be associated with multiple entries , @GENE$ must decide which entry is to be used to retrieve annotation	1
1115	The adopted approach is to use the most recent entry that might be not the one the user aimed at to retrieve annotation	1
1116	The user may request automatically generated ID - to - name log ( see below ) for checking the quality of the conversion	1
1117	To ensure unequivocal ID processing the user must use UIDs in input	1
1118	UIDs from one database can be used to query another non - cognate database in which it may be not recognized at all or recognized as non - unique IDs ( The user has a choice of reading @GENE$ output either on the " Execution " web page , or at a separate web page in plain text mode , or receiving it via e - mail	1
1119	For tree input , @GENE$ generates , additionally to the standard output , a respective tree drawn to facilitate visual inspection of the generated names in graphic format	1
1120	The web page output can be enhanced with links to cognate entries accessible through the generated names .	1
1121	To define the key prime - side interactions accounting for the inhibition of these @GENE$ , the peptide @GENE$ was modeled into our @GENE$ crystal structure ( Fig	1
1122	4A )	1
1123	For modeling purposes , the P1 residue was selected as leucine since we had solved a crystal structure with that residue in the P1 position - we were unable to get a crystal structure of norleucine - and leucine was the second most favored P1 residue in our MSP - MS assay	1
1124	The first three residues ( Leu1 - His2 - Ser3 ) were modeled from a poly - alanine structure and last two residues ( Pro4 - Trp5 ) were from the structure of @GENE$ complexed with substance P , which also contains a proline at the 4th position ( PDB ID : 4HOM )	1
1125	As predicted from the @GENE$ structural data , the side chain of Leu1 in both peptides points into a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by @GENE$ M349 , Q208 , and F467 ( Fig	1
1126	4B )	1
1127	The side chain of His2 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of pAPN residue A346	1
1128	Pro4 forms a turn in the peptide , whereas the side chains of Ser3 and Trp5 both form VDW interactions with APN residue Y472 ( Fig	1
1129	4C ) .	1
1130	A strong association with relative humidity was also found for hMPV infections	1
1131	Association with meteorological factors has not previously been described for this virus	1
1132	Belonging to the Pneumovirinae subfamily [ 53 ] , both RSV and hMPV could require similar conditions for transmission and infectivity	1
1133	In contrast , PIV3 was strongly and positively correlated with both temperature and rainfall , but not with relative humidity	1
1134	A study in Singapore found no such associations for PIV3 [ 54 ]	1
1135	It is also interesting to note that , in our study , InfB infections showed an inverse correlation with relative humidity , temperature and rainfall , while @DISEASE$ infections did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors	1
1136	In Singapore , InfA outbreaks were also not associated with meteorological factors , but InfB infections were reported to positively correlate with rainfall [ 54 ] .	1
1137	Not unexpectedly , RSV was by far the most common virus in our study , identified in 15	1
1138	1 % of all @DISEASE$ cases and 37	1
1139	7 % of viral positive cases	1
1140	Etiology studies in developing countries that included viruses have identified @DISEASE$ in a median of 20 % ( 5th to 95th percentile 1 to 53 ) of @DISEASE$ cases [ 30 ] and in 6 % to 96 % ( mean 39 % ) of @DISEASE$ cases with a viral etiology [ 1 ]	1
1141	It should be noted that many of these studies also included @DISEASE$	1
1142	A recently published denominator - based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three @DISEASE$ epidemics reported that 13 % of cases with @DISEASE$ were attributable to @DISEASE$ infection , which was diagnosed using IF [ 31 ]	1
1143	In India , RSV accounted for 17 % of hospitalized cases with @DISEASE$ in New Delhi [ 32 ] and 7 % of @DISEASE$ cases included in a 3 - year longitudinal community study in Haryana [ 28 ]	1
1144	After RSV , InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study , as reported elsewhere [ 1 , 3 , 28 ]	1
1145	We detected hMPV in 4	1
1146	2 % of @DISEASE$ cases	1
1147	It is estimated that @DISEASE$ worldwide accounts for 5 to 7 % of @DISEASE$ in young children requiring hospitalization [ 33 ]	1
1148	In India , hMPV was detected in 3	1
1149	2 % of 662 children hospitalized for @DISEASE$ over a 2 - year period from April 2005 [ 34 ] .	1
1150	Prospective , active surveillance was conducted in PICUs of paediatric hospitals in Bavaria , Germany	1
1151	On December 31 st , 2010 roughly 2 , 001 , 700 children < 17 years of age were registered in Bavaria [ 21 ] , representing 16 % of the German population in this age group [ 22 ]	1
1152	The annual study population was defined as the sub - group of all children in Bavaria at least 1 month and < 17 years of age .	1
1153	In our study , @GENE$ was also shown to interact with the @GENE$ ( Figure 4A )	1
1154	In line with this , the adapter function of @GENE$ in @GENE$ recruitment and subsequent @GENE$ activation was perturbed by @GENE$ ( Figures 4B - D ) , which plausibly contributed to the @GENE$ antagonism of the @GENE$ ( Figures 1 - 3 )	1
1155	The @GENE$ is a @GENE$ that was shown to co - localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - Golgi intermediate compartments in the perinuclear area	1
1156	22 Although @GENE$ is known to adapt the mitochondrial transducer @GENE$ , it is not associated with mitochondria but rather with the Golgi apparatus and ER - Golgi intermediate compartments in unstimulated conditions , 30 , 54 rendering it susceptible to interaction with the @GENE$	1
1157	Upon stimulation with ligands or viral infection , @GENE$ appears on @GENE$ originating from Golgi	1
1158	Retention of @GENE$ in ER - to - Golgi compartments and inability to form Golgi fragments rendered @GENE$ expression inefficient	1
1159	54 Therefore , whether @GENE$ - containing Golgi fragment formation is affected by @GENE$ warrants further analysis	1
1160	This may serve as a novel mechanism by which @GENE$ counteract host @GENE$ production .	1
1161	Contact was defined as meeting at least one of the following four criteria : 4 being within 2m of a confirmed patient , staying in the same space as a confirmed patient for over 5 minutes , contact with a patient ' s respiratory or digestive secretions and contact with specimens from confirmed patients before the sample was packaged	1
1162	Contact within the same space was graded into four levels according to distance of contact and wearing of PPE	1
1163	Without full @GENE$ protection : Grade 1 was defined as contact within 2m , and Grade 2 was defined as contact at over 2m	1
1164	With full @GENE$ protection : Grade 3 was defined as contact within 2m , and Grade 4 was defined as contact at over 2m .	1
1165	The weekly episodes of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ were analyzed with a mixed - effects negative binomial generalized linear model	1
1166	Fixed effects in the model were week , diet , and the interaction between	1
1167	The random effects were animal nested within clinic	1
1168	For vomiting , the change from week 0 to weeks 1 - 4 for each diet and between diets was tested	1
1169	For @DISEASE$ , the change from week 1 to weeks 2 - 4 for each diet and between diets was tested	1
1170	The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV@GENE$ ne , a@GENE$ dy on @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive / negative and retaining the same contrasts	1
1171	This same model was altered to have a response of the total vomiting occurrences over the 4 weeks and fixed effects of diet and age	1
1172	Vomiting was also modeled against the initial Spec fPL values using a negative binomial model , as before , however with the change in vomiting from baseline as the interaction between	1
1173	Random effects were animal nested within clinic	1
1174	The same hypothesis tests were also performed comparing the change between weeks within and between diets .	1
1175	Early automated methods , including the laser lightscattering spectroscopy , photodiode and photomultiplier methods were developed to calculate ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) based on changes in light intensity around beating cilia under the microscope [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
1176	More recently , a number of bespoke image analysis software programs have been developed to automatically compute CBF from video files captured using video microscopy [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]	1
1177	This software computes changes in pixel intensity over time ( as shown in Figure 1A ) to Hertz using fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) , a function that has been used frequently for this application [ 14 , 15 ]	1
1178	However , the studies that describe this software lack two important elements : comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow - motion video replay of cilia , and the measurement cilia that beat at very high frequencies [ 8 , 9 ]	1
1179	This is important as some phenotypes of @DISEASE$ display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz	1
1180	In this paper , we describe software that was validated by comparing results to those obtained by direct measurement of high - speed video recordings of cilia	1
1181	The program also runs using open - source software	1
1182	To evaluate a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies we studied both human respiratory cilia and ependymal cilia from the rat brain	1
1183	Respiratory cilia usually beat at less than 16 Hz [ 7 ] and brain cilia usually beat at over 36 Hz	1
1184	To obtain CBF measurements above 16 Hz , we slowed the frequency at which ependymal cilia beat by adding the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin , which we have previously shown to reduce ependymal CBF [ 4 ] @GENE$ liaFA program has been made freely available and may be downloaded in Additional file 1 .	1
1185	Monitoring ecological dynamics and interactions among bats and other wild and domestic animals coupled with behavioral and socio - economic studies of humans in shared ecosystems are hallmarks of a One Health approach [ 14 ]	1
1186	Such approaches are necessary to proactively detect and minimize the emergence and impact of @DISEASE$	1
1187	To be effective , a One Health research agenda must synergize with individual experts in bat ecology , physiology , behavior , and genetics , as well as linking in with experts across veterinary and human health sciences	1
1188	One approach to most efficiently leverage this collective expertise and quickly share knowledge across scientific disciplines is to tap into existing scientific networks	1
1189	The multiple bat research networks of the world ( Figure 1 ) pose a unique resource and opportunity in this regard	1
1190	However , these networks currently have differing levels of coordination , resources , and active participation , making this approach more difficult in some geographic areas	1
1191	Creating a combined bat conservation and @DISEASE$ research network de novo would allow for full integration of these two disciplines from the start by supporting efforts to conserve bat populations and their critical roosting and foraging habitats and helping to safeguard human health from bat - associated viruses	1
1192	Western Asia is the only contiguous block of countries that currently lacks an organized network of bat researchers (@GENE$ presenting a conservation void in terms of global bat conservation [ 4 ] and an opportunity to integrate initiatives to proactively monitor public health through virus surveillance .	1
1193	iLIR @ viral : A web resource for @GENE$ in viruses	1
1194	Given the prevalence and high titers of @DISEASE$ and its wide host range [ 21 ] , it is not surprising that the field - collected control colonies were also tested positive for DWV at low levels	1
1195	Since our experimental data clearly show that @DISEASE$ transmission to ants is feasible via food , we assume that either ( 1 ) DWV - contaminated food must have been given to the ant colonies in captivity prior to our experiments or alternatively , but not mutually exclusive , ( 2 ) the D	1
1196	hydei flies used as control food were DWV positive , which we regard as unlikely , or ( 3 ) the control colonies had consumed @DISEASE$ - infected food prior to field - sampling by the company	1
1197	Given the latter case , this would support the view that @DISEASE$ transmission to M	1
1198	rubra also occurs in the field , which would be in line with other studies showing the presence of viruses , originally described from honeybees , in ants [ 29 , 37 ]	1
1199	A closer look at the controls also reveals that the viruses are not equally distributed within these naturally infected colonies	1
1200	It would be interesting to see if the uneven distribution is due to age - related division of labor and non - stochastic interaction patterns [ 73 ] , i	1
1201	e	1
1202	, foragers might have a higher exposure risk compared to in - house workers	1
1203	Considering the low viral titers in the controls , it is possible that the viruses persist in M	1
1204	rubra as a covert infection that might turn into an overt infection under suitable conditions , e	1
1205	g	1
1206	, parasite infections as in honeybees [ 26 ] .	1
1207	Furthermore , the decisions with regard to the type of research , the study population and the research beneficiaries often lack transparency , are also dominated by the most powerful	1
1208	The case of the @DISEASE$ , dubbed the @DISEASE$ that never really was ^ ( Evans 2010 ; Bonneux and Van Damme 2010 ) , demonstrates the potential consequences of private and uncommunicated decision - making processes in research and development	1
1209	In the case of the @DISEASE$ , allegedly scientists conducting research and advising the World Health Organization on the virus were compensated by drug companies	1
1210	This may have introduced bias ( Evans , 2010 , p	1
1211	296 )	1
1212	By increasing fear of a global pandemic , scientific research funded by pharmaceutical companies justified the stockpiling of antiviral supplies , thus increasing their vaccine sales ( Evans 2010 ) .	1
1213	Rapid Evolution of @GENE$ Suggests a Broad Role for ADP - Ribosylation in Host - Virus Conflicts	1
1214	The diagram of @GENE$ dataflow is shown in Figure 1	1
1215	The user submits @GENE$ , defines a format of conversion , and selects a database to be searched	1
1216	Currently available databases include GenBank / RefSeq / GenPept , UniProt , EMBL , SeqHound and EnsEMBL ( @GENE$ for Human sequences )	1
1217	@GENE$ extracts @GENE$ from the input and queries the database with these IDs to locate associated annotation	1
1218	After retrieving annotation , @GENE$ designs names according to a name template that defines name structure and annotationbased content for submitted entries	1
1219	The final step of the @GENE$ - mediated processing is substitution of submitted @GENE$ in the input with the designed names to return results to the user .	1
1220	The 2003 - 2004 H5N1 highly pathogenic @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) outbreaks in Japan were the first such outbreaks in 79 years in Japan	1
1221	Epidemic outbreaks have been occurring in Southeast Asia , with the most recent in 2010	1
1222	Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the @DISEASE$ outbreaks in these countries remains elusive	1
1223	Our studies strongly suggested that field and laboratory studies focusing on mechanical transmission by blow flies should be considered to control @DISEASE$ outbreaks , in particular in epidemic areas , where there are high densities of different fly species throughout the year	1
1224	In this paper , we review these field and laboratory entomological studies and discuss the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 viruses .	1
1225	Anti - EV71 viral drugs and vaccine are being developed , but their protective efficacy could not be efficiently evaluated due to lack of proper animal model	1
1226	Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse - adapted strain of EV71 [ 5 ] , innate immunodeficient mice [ 6 ] , or monkey models [ 7 ]	1
1227	The intraperitoneal ( i	1
1228	p	1
1229	) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms	1
1230	Administration of mouse - adapted EV71 strain 4643 ( Tainan / 4643 / 98 ) to 1 - d - old ICR mice caused @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [ 8 ]	1
1231	Challenge of 1 - d - old BALB / C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [ 5 ]	1
1232	A deficiency in typ@GENE$ the AG129 mouse cause @DISEASE$ after infection with the non - mouse adapted EV71 strain ( 5865 / SIN / 00009 ; [ 6 ] )	1
1233	The EV71 BrCr strain , an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [ 9 ] , was demonstrated to induce @DISEASE$ of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ , but no @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ in cynomolgus monkeys [ 7 ]	1
1234	These models are not perfect for @DISEASE$ or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71	1
1235	Viral pathogenesis in mouseadapted EV71 - infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe ( up to one week old of mouse age ) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71	1
1236	In addition , innate immunity , particularly type I IFN , involved for the EV71 @GENE$ athogenic phenotype was reported [ 10 , 11 ] .	1
1237	The ability of BAL fluid cellular analysis to distinguish between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ was assessed using ROC analysis ( Table 3 last The sensitivities , specificities , positive predictive values , negative predictive values , positive likelihood ratios , and negative likelihood ratios are summarized in Table 4	1

1272	Evidence indicates that nurses have a heavy workload and they work under pressure on a daily basis	1
1273	They are expected to have high levels of independence , well - developed problem - solving abilities , and leadership responsibilities	1
1274	Regardless of all the skills they have acquired they still express needs that are not met by the healthcare managements	1
1275	The following sub - themes were developed under support needs for the nurses : good ventilated working environment , good infection control and prevention measurements , and special support from management .	1
1276	According to the findings of the present study even though the support structure from the management is available , there is a need for special support for @DISEASE$ patients	1
1277	Lack of support from the management confuses the nursing staff and causes staff to lose interest in their job	1
1278	The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Manyisa and van Aswegen [ 28 ] , which revealed that South African hospitals ' working environments lack resources and managerial support .	1
1279	The TNS method is consistently found to provide most accurate predictions of epidemic size , regardless of the county of disease introduction and disease parameters	1
1280	In Devon , only 3 % of the nodes require sampling for the TNS method to predict epidemic sizes at 6 weeks , compared with 10 % , 20 % and 80 % for the SBS , RMS and RNS methods , respectively , with similar effects seen at 12 weeks and for the full epidemic ( electronic supplementary material , figure S17 )	1
1281	Similar behaviour is observed in Aberdeenshire ( electronic supplementary material , figure S19 )	1
1282	The values for S min for the full epidemic for all sampling methods for epidemics seeded in the three counties are summarized in electronic supplementary material , table S1 .	1
1283	Markets may play a key role in amplification of disease transmission [ 37 ]	1
1284	The @DISEASE$ explicitly states whether a movement went through a market and , if so , which market was used	1
1285	This allows us to construct networks that include markets as nodes	1
1286	The above - listed sampling schemes can all be applied to this situation	1
1287	There is significant uncertainty regarding the level of contact of animals from different batches ( farms ) on a market , and therefore the risk of transmission between animals during their stay on the market	1
1288	For this reason , we investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3 )	1
1289	In the first scenario , we assume no within - market transmission , such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm	1
1290	We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced ( this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network )	1
1291	In the second scenario , we assume no segregation and no biosecurity at rspb	1

1297	In this case , we use the @DISEASE$ data to determine which batches of cattle move through a market	1
1298	When an infected batch moves to a market , that market becomes infected and we then assume that infection can be transmitted to all possible destination farms ( as determined based on the destinations of all batches that move from the market ) with an equal probability	1
1299	A graphic depicting how the network is altered by the inclusion of markets is shown in the electronic supplementary material , figure S3 , and pseudo - code for the updated epidemic process is shown in the electronic supplementary material , algorithm 2 .	1
1300	Assessment of cytotoxic T cell responses of reservoir hosts has not been reported	1
1301	Most assays that assess CTL functions require susceptible syngeneic target cells , which have been difficult to obtain with reservoir hosts	1
1302	Susceptible primary cell lines from reservoir hosts have been produced [ 37 , 78 ] , but these are typically obtained from embryonic fibroblasts , thus matching of @GENE$ for use in CTL assays is difficult .	1

1318	The Eurasian red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) in the UK , has suffered a severe reduction in its abundance and distribution ( Bosch and Lurz 2012 ) , coinciding with the introduction of the non - native Eastern grey squirrel ( Sciurus carolinensis ) in the 1900s ( Gurnell and Pepper 1993 ; Usher et al	1
1319	1992 )	1
1320	A combination of modelling ( Rushton et al	1
1321	2006 ; Tompkins et al	1
1322	2003 ) , experimental infection studies ( Tompkins et al	1
1323	2002 ) and field data ( Chantrey et al	1
1324	2014 ) indicates that a major part of the decline of UK red squirrel populations is due to infection by @DISEASE$ ( SQPV )	1
1325	This pathogen is thought to have been introduced with the grey squirrel , a theory supported by a high prevalence of exposure despite an absence of clinical disease ( Bruemmer et al	1
1326	2010 ; Sainsbury et al	1
1327	2000 ) , an association between seropositive grey squirrels and the appearance of clinical cases of @DISEASE$ in red squirrels ( McInnes et al	1
1328	, 2013 Sainsbury et al	1
1329	2008 ) and an association of the pathogen in both squirrel species during an outbreak of disease in red squirrels ( Chantrey et al	1
1330	2014 )	1
1331	Programmes to reintroduce red squirrels in the UK have been hampered by disease : by SQPV in Norfolk ( Carroll et al	1
1332	2009 ) and adenovirus in squirrels ( SADV ) in other areas of the UK ( Everest et al	1
1333	2008 ( Everest et al	1
1334	, 2012b Martinez - Jimenez et al	1
1335	2011 )	1
1336	SADV appears to cause mortality in wild red squirrels ( Duff et al	1
1337	2007 ; Everest et al	1
1338	2012a ) , although the impact on a population scale is largely unknown with subclinical infections also reported ( Everest et al	1
1339	2014 ) .	1
1340	The ability to inhibit @GENE$ and @GENE$ production but not @GENE$ was attributed to 1 , 8 - cineole , santoline , spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide , major constituents of the essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh	1
1341	leaves [ 109 ]	1

1343	oil , mainly constituted by 1 , 8 - cineole along with α - pinene , camphor and p - cymene was only able to reduce the pro - inflammatory @GENE$ production in the mouse colon in which @DISEASE$ was induced by 2 , 4 , 6 - trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS ) , not suppressin@GENE$ β [ 110 ] .	1
1344	The use of restrictive measures such as quarantine draws into sharp relief the dynamic interplay between the individual rights of the citizen on the one hand and the collective rights of the community on the other	1
1345	Concerns regarding @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) have intensified the need to understand public perceptions of quarantine and other social distancing measures .	1
1346	Two of the 28 @DISEASE$ patients were infected with resistant bacteria ( 3MRGN Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and MRSA )	1
1347	In 11 @DISEASE$ patients , bacterial pathogens such as Legionella ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , and @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) were identified in BAL samples	1
1348	@DISEASE$ were more frequent in the @DISEASE$ group ( p = 0	1
1349	046 ; Pearson ' s chi - squared test ) , especially @DISEASE$ ( p < 0	1
1350	05 )	1
1351	In more than half of the @DISEASE$ patients , @DISEASE$ was diagnosed according to the results of BAL samples , radiological findings , and clinical symptoms	1
1352	One or more of the following viruses could be detected in BAL samples : influenza ( n = 10 ; 36 % ) and @DISEASE$ ( n = 9 ; 32 % )	1
1353	@DISEASE$ included HSV ( n = 7 ; 25 % ) , CMV ( n = 2 ; 7 % ) , and HHV6 ( in BAL and blood ; n = 1 )	1
1354	In 7 of the IVIG - treated patients , @DISEASE$ was diagnosed in urinary tract ( n = 4 ) and abdominal samples ( n = 2 )	1
1355	In addition , one patient suffered @DISEASE$	1
1356	In three @DISEASE$ , no causal pathogen could be identified ( 11 % ) .	1
1357	Using Metacore TM software , we were able to suggest the main pathways related to @DISEASE$	1
1358	Interestingly , a pathway that involved the degradation of CFTR@GENE$ significantly enriched in our study	1
1359	CFTR@GENE$  tran@GENE$  functions as an ATP @GENE$ ISEASE$ can lead@GENE$ everal diseases related to the reduction of chloride secretion and the increase of sodium uptake 54	1
1360	Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in @DISEASE$ epithelial cells and that CFTR may be effectiv@GENE$ cell repair after injury 18 , 55 , 56	1
1361	@DISEASE$ is normally cytopathic in infected F81 cells	1
1362	Typical CPEs appear as@GENE$ sh of monolayer cells prompted by detached cells	1
1363	These results provided us hints that CPV may trigger @DISEASE$ and @GENE$ ence the cell pathological change by reducing the wound healing of infected cells .	1
1364	A Top 20 data - dependent acquisition mode was selected in the mass spectrometer , with automatic switching between MS and MS / MS	1
1365	Full - scan MS mode ( 350 − 1800 m / z ) was operated at a resolution of 70 , 000 , with an automatic gain control target of 1 × 10 6 ions and a maximum ion transfer of 60 ms	1
1366	The precursor ions were fragmented by high - energy collisional dissociation and subjected to MS / MS scans with the following parameters : resolution , 17 , 500 ; automatic gain control , 5 × 10 6 ions ; maximum ion transfer , 70 ms ; intensity threshold , 5 , 000 ; and normalised collision energy , 29 % .	1
1367	The exponential growth in the size of biological databases has established the need for high performance computing ( HPC ) in bioinformatics	1
1368	Typically , an HPC setup operates in a cluster computing environment consisting of multiple computers that communicate over fast switches	1
1369	For popular database scanning applications such as BLAST and HMMER the benefits of clusters are immediate and linear speedups can be easily achieved	1
1370	However , the evolving challenges in life sciences cannot be all addressed by off - the - shelf bioinformatics applications	1
1371	Life scientists need to analyze their data using novel approaches published in recent journals or based on their own hypotheses and assumptions	1
1372	Quascade - MP2 has been developed to address this need	1
1373	It is a visual prototyping tool created especially for data - driven , high performance scientific applications .	1
1374	Variant or drifted viral strains may lower the sensitivity of detection resulting in a decreased quantitation of the viral load and underestimation of disease incidence [ 19 ]	1
1375	We checked the new @GENE$ for nucleotide differences in the @GENE$ targeted by our diagnostic @GENE$ and probes ( Additional file 7 : Table S4 ) used for HMPV detection	1
1376	Up to eight primer - and probetemplate mismatches were identified ( Fig	1
1377	4 ) : one mismatch in the @GENE$ in HMPV group A ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig	1
1378	4a ) ; one mismatch in each of the @GENE$ in group B ( F gene - based rRT - PCR assay , Fig	1
1379	4b ) ; and 5 different mismatches with the @GENE$ - gene based rRT - PCR assay ( Fig	1
1380	4c )	1
1381	Note , the @GENE$ gene - based @GENE$ assays are different or specific to the two HMPV groups .	1
1382	@DISEASE$ : pathogenesis and therapeutic developments	1
1383	The most common clinical signs reported in @DISEASE$ include @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and they have been described in more than half of the cases ( Table 4 )	1
1384	Some cats showed only @DISEASE$ alone [ 13 , 52 , 56 , 58 ] , while others with @DISEASE$ showed a combination with systemic signs [ 12 , 14 , 21 , 26 , 36 , 51 , 60 , [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] 68 ]	1
1385	Conversely , other cats did not have any skin detectable lesions on clinical presentation [ 11 , 36 , 50 , 54 , 55 , 57 , 66 , 69 , 70 ] .	1
1386	For the first time , we have demonstrated that maternal H 2 administration improved MIA - induced @DISEASE$ of offspring , including short - term memory and social interaction at postnatal 3 - 5 weeks	1
1387	Previously , we reported that maternal H 2 administration suppresses microglial activation in the same model	1
1388	In the present study , H 2 also suppressed the activation of astrocytes , both in vitro and in vivo	1
1389	Taken together , these results suggest that H 2 exerts a protective role against MIA - induced @DISEASE$ through the suppression of microglia and astrocytes	1
1390	As a result , mature oligodendrocytes were restored and neurons were protected from damage , thus leading to improved long - term neurological outcomes following maternal H 2 administration	1
1391	Prenatal exposure to LPS also resulted in a transient reduction in body weight of the offspring between P6 - P10 , which was attenuated by maternal H 2 administration	1
1392	This might be due to a change in the activity of the hypothalamic - pituitary axis 35	1
1393	@DISEASE$ neonatal growth has been reported to contribute to poor neurologic outcome 36 , thus , the transient decrease of weight observed in this model might be related to the @DISEASE$ in the offspring .	1
1394	In contrast to CanL , @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
1395	5 ) is rare in the feline disease [ 36 , 52 , 68 ]	1
1396	Other uncommon dermatologic presentations include @DISEASE$ where @DISEASE$ can be found [ 37 , 52 ]	1
1397	@DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
1398	6 ) , which is also uncommon in FeL [ 12 , 36 , 52 , 62 , 64 ] , may be associated with other @DISEASE$ concurring in @DISEASE$	1
1399	infantum infected cats such as @DISEASE$ [ 64 ]	1
1400	Mild to severe @DISEASE$ is rare in FeL [ 58 , 64 , 65 ] and in some cases with a @DISEASE$ other compatible causes co - existed such as @DISEASE$ [ 52 ] , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 56 ] or @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 14 ]	1
1401	Skin histopathology of lesions associated with @DISEASE$	1
1402	infantum has shown that the most commonly observed alteration is a @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 51 , 56 , 59 , 60 , 68 ] .	1
1403	The study protocol , informed consent statement , clinical research form , any amendments and all other study documents were submitted to and approved by the institutional ethics committee ( Comité National d ' Ethique pour la Santé et les Sciences de la Vie )	1
1404	Written informed consent was obtained from all participants .	1
1405	The AIV standard curve was carried out for each run together with the samples	1
1406	All tests were performed on the Bio - Rad CFX96 real - time PCR system and analyzed using the Bio - Rad software .	1
1407	The non - parametric Mann Whitney test was used to compare the virus load of tracheal and cloacal swabs , and to establish whether virus loads in the oviducts were significantly different from those reported in the rest of the organs	1
1408	Oviposition , eggshell thickness , and numbers of misshaped and discoloured eggs were expressed as daily means for each group	1
1409	We compared the weekly means among groups using the Wilcoxon matched - pairs signedranks test , a two - tailed P value	1
1410	Statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism 5	1
1411	0 software ( GraphPad Prism , GraphPad Software , La Jolla CA , USA ) and the significance level was set at P < 0	1
1412	05 .	1
1413	The prevention and control of @DISEASE$ at the global scale relies critically on our understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination	1
1414	Here , we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide	1
1415	Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global @DISEASE$ spread , an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies ( e	1
1416	g	1
1417	[ 5 ] ) , but has , until now , remained difficult to obtain from empirical data	1
1418	The dominant predictors of @DISEASE$ spread will undoubtedly be scale - dependent , as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas ( Fig	1
1419	2 ) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel , such as workplace commuting [ 9 ]	1
1420	This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales , where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious , provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available	1
1421	One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of @GENE$ worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location , which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes	1
1422	More representative sampling across the globe , or within a more geographically confined area of interest , will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures	1
1423	In particular , if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [ 34 ]	1
1424	In addition , many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution , for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin - destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes .	1
1425	Using this approach , we could reliably justify the ICTV classification of 14055 out 15589 proteins loaded into the database .	1
1426	The above reviewed studies contain a common message : CPP - conjugated antiviral agents hold great promise as novel preventive and therapeutic modalities against @DISEASE$	1
1427	The remarkable antiviral effects of PPMOs against lethal infections with EBOV , VEEV , FLUAV and DENV , and against the usually - lethal infections with PV1 and WNV , call for a wider use of CPPs in the delivery of antiviral drugs	1
1428	CPP - conjugated antivirals also show promise in inhibiting the reactivation from latent infections of viruses such as HSV - 1	1
1429	Moreover , the assessment of CPP antiviral properties and the understanding of their molecular mechanisms could lead to the exploitation of these activities for the development of microbicides to inactivate virions after exposure .	1
1430	Following common practice [ 36 , 58 ] , we measure the accuracy of a predicted RNA secondary structure relative to a reference secondary structure by F - measure , which is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value ( PPV )	1
1431	We define these values as follows :	1
1432	We provide a high level description of our Iterative HFold algorithm .	1
1433	Sequences were considered part of the same genotype if they had > 96 % identity in @GENE$ , an established cut - off for Bartonella species identification [ 53 ]	1
1434	Sequences with > 99	1
1435	7 % similarity were considered the same genetic variant [ 54 ]	1
1436	We used a Chi - squared test with the p value generated via a Monte Carlo procedure with 1000 simulations [ 55 ] to assess whether our defined Bartonella genotypes were associated with region ( i	1
1437	e	1
1438	, Belize , eastern Peruvian Amazon , western Peruvian Amazon ) .	1
1439	that the presence of the @GENE$ during the viral infection phase can lead to a higher percentage of infected cells ( Fig	1
1440	8A )	1
1441	In nonpolarized macrophages , this enhancement of infection by JEV was statistically significant for @GENE$ alone , for @GENE$ combined with @GENE$ , and for @GENE$ combined with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Fig	1
1442	9A )	1
1443	In IL - 4 - polarized macrophages , a further enhancement of infection was statistically significant for @GENE$ alone , @GENE$ alone , and every combination of @GENE$ with the other @GENE$ ( Fig	1
1444	9B ) .	1
1445	H	1
1446	influenzae was the predominant aerobic bacterial pathogen , isolated in 30	1
1447	3 % of our patients	1
1448	Although previously other authors have had similar results , isolated strains of H	1
1449	influenzae were never further characterised [ 9 , 10 , 20 , 23 ]	1
1450	To our knowledge this is the first report that associates @DISEASE$ with nontypeable H	1
1451	influenzae ( NTHi ) in young persistant @DISEASE$	1
1452	Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that @DISEASE$ present an underlying inflammation induced by @DISEASE$	1
1453	@DISEASE$ , resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses , has previously been reported by others [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]	1
1454	Moreover , in the lower airways of patients with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [ 31 , 34 ] .	1
1455	Etiology and Factors Associated with @DISEASE$ in Children under 5 Years of Age in Mali : A Prospective Case - Control Study	1
1456	We observed one distinct @DISEASE$ epidemic , which peaked between December 2004 and January 2005	1
1457	The epidemic lasted from July 2004 to January 2005 and comprised 70 % of the @DISEASE$ isolates detected during the entire 3year study period	1
1458	Substantial variation in the yearly incidence of @DISEASE$ has also been reported earlier [ 43 , 44 ]	1
1459	Epidemics with this virus have been reported to occur during late winter to spring in temperate climates [ 33 , 45 ] , including North India [ 46 ] , where the majority of hMPV were detected from December to February , and Korea [ 45 ] , where @DISEASE$ peaked between February and April	1
1460	A study in subtropical Hong Kong found @DISEASE$ infections mainly in the spring and summer months [ 47 ] , similar to that of @DISEASE$ [ 48 ] and occasionally @DISEASE$ [ 49 ] .	1
1461	In - house real - time RT - PCRs were performed according to hospital laboratory standard operating procedures for the qualitative detection of @GENE$ and of Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( MP )	1
1462	The target of amplification for hMPV was the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) with primer sequences and method as described by Hopkins et al	1
1463	and 45 cycles were run on real - time PCR ( ABI prism 7900 HT FAST ) [ 17 ]	1
1464	Positive and negative controls were included , and a Ct value of ≤ 37 was considered positive	1
1465	The target of amplification for MP was the @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ escribed by Winchell et al	1
1466	[ 18 ]	1
1467	Both internal DNA control and a positive and negative control were included in the reaction run	1
1468	A Ct value ≤ 34 was considered positive .	1
1469	Gambit ( version 2	1
1470	4	1
1471	6 ) was used to build the geometry domain and generate the cells for CFD simulation	1
1472	The meshes were automatically generated by Gambit according to the mesh type and maximum mesh size	1
1473	The whole region around the seated passengers and the standing person were meshed by unstructured grids of tetrahedron	1
1474	The maximum mesh size was 0	1
1475	03 m and the total number was 9 , 098 , 636	1
1476	Other parts of the cabin ( the aisle behind and in front of the standing person ) were meshed by structured grids of hexahedron	1
1477	The maximum mesh size was 0	1
1478	025 m and the total number was 99 , 264	1
1479	The grid system was chosen based on the grid convergence index ( GCI ) analysis [ 21 ]	1
1480	By comparing the computed velocity magnitudes at 800 selected points in the GCI analysis , finer grid system did not have much improvement in GCI compared to the selected grid system ( GCI finer < 5 % ) [ 22 ]	1
1481	So a grid system containing 9 , 197 , 900 cells was finally adopted in this computational geometry .	1
1482	Presently , @GENE$ readthrough in @GENE$ ( 55 ) and @GENE$ in PRRSV ( 19 , this work ) represent the only two examples of specific modulation of translational decoding ( recoding ) mediated by proteins	1
1483	The participation of @GENE$ in each case may reflect the versatility of these proteins in linking sequence - specific nucleic acid binding with specific protein - protein interactions and serving as a fulcrum for multilateral molecular cross - talk ( 58 )	1
1484	It seems highly unlikely that protein - mediated recoding will be restricted to the two present examples , given the plethora of @GENE$ and other @GENE$ present in @GENE$ .	1
1485	The geometry and stoichiometry of the @GENE$ on the @GENE$ is uncertain and difficult to predict	1
1486	@GENE$ exists as a dimer in solution ( 32 ) , @GENE$ have been shown to be capable of homo - and heteromultimerization and RNA binding by @GENE$ could reflect interaction with single or multiple @GENE$ ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 )	1
1487	Binding assays with optimized @GENE$ generated by in vitro SELEX have revealed that a tandem array of three @GENE$ maximizes @GENE$ binding to its @GENE$ ( 45 ) and several established @GENE$ contain three or more @GENE$ ( 33 , 46 )	1
1488	However , the sequence motifs implicated in @GENE$ binding from gene expression analysis of human cells ( 47 , 48 ) and Caenorhabditis elegans ( 49 ) comprise predominantly two adjacent @GENE$ , although it is not known how strongly @GENE$ bind to these targets , nor whether any other @GENE$ participate in the interactions	1
1489	The EMSA data presented here reveal that alone , @GENE$ and @GENE$ bind weakly to the @GENE$ ( which has two @GENE$ ) , requiring @GENE$ for stable binding	1
1490	Similarly , @GENE$ binds RNA very weakly , but is evident in complexes ( with @GENE$ ) from supershift assays	1
1491	Stable complex formation on the mRNA thus likely depends upon conformational changes in one or both molecular partners and potentially , direct contact between @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
1492	In support of the latter , we found that amino acid substitutions in the putative RBM ) of @GENE$ greatly weakened the association of the complex with RNA , without apparent effect on the interaction with @GENE$	1
1493	Yeast two - hybrid studies ( 35 ) have shown that the reciprocal interaction of @GENE$ and @GENE$ requires the @GENE$ of @GENE$ , including the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and Cterminal extension , and the @GENE$ of @GENE$	1
1494	In light of this , we hypothesize that the association of @GENE$ with @GENE$ would not preclude binding of @GENE$ to RNA	1
1495	An alternative interpretation is that @GENE$ ␤ RBM fails to induce a conformational change in PCBPs necessary for stable RNA association .	1
1496	A similar approach was used in identifying the relevant articles	1
1497	For each epidemic , the search terms included the name of the disease outbreak and the country of interest : BSARS AND Toronto , ^ BZika AND Brazil , ^ and BEbola AND Liberia	1
1498	^ It was vital that each search included the income setting to ensure that the findings were contextually relevant	1
1499	These terms were then combined with the terms Bsociet * , ^ Bsociol * , ^ and Bpolitic *	1
1500	^ Truncation was used to ensure inclusion of all terms , including Bsociety , ^ Bsocietal , B sociological , ^ Bsociology , ^ Bpolitics , ^ Bpolitical , B politician , ^ and Bpoliticization	1
1501	^ The search terms must have Tables 2 , 3 , and 4 summarize the search results for the three outbreaks within the specified contexts	1
1502	The titles and abstracts of the search results were reviewed for relevance to the politics of epidemics	1
1503	All biomedical articles describing biomedical research were excluded	1
1504	All articles that were relevant to the study topic were retrieved and reviewed	1
1505	The initial review involved RA , grouping the search results according to the disease outbreak	1
1506	For each outbreak , @GENE$ first scanned through a couple of papers , identifying the emerging themes	1
1507	Once these were identified , subsequent reviews were structured along these themes , although an open stance was maintained throughout to enable the reviewer to identify any additional relevant themes .	1
1508	We established in vitro cell and in vivo mouse systems harboring @GENE$ and antiviral mechanism against PRV and HSV as DNA viruses with @GENE$	1
1509	The expression patterns of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were identified and the @GENE$ assay and confocal microscopy were performed to investigate the antiviral mechanism shown in our experimental in vitro and in vivo systems	1
1510	Taken together , our data support that the antiviral effect against the DNA virus used in this work was caused by ( 1 ) nuclear @GENE$ activity that inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and ( 2 ) @GENE$ activity in the cytoplasm blocked protein translation .	1
1511	@DISEASE$ is the leading cause of child mortality from @DISEASE$ , accounting for an estimated 1 million deaths annually , and mainly affecting children in developing countries [ 1 , 2 ]	1
1512	Mortality attributed to @DISEASE$ has decreased since 2000 , but remains a major public health concern [ 3 , 4 ]	1
1513	The main known causative pathogens reported are Streptococcus pneumoniae , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) [ 5 ]	1
1514	However , their distribution varies by season and location	1
1515	Data on the etiology and epidemiology of @DISEASE$ in children in developing countries are still insufficient , particularly in sub - Saharan Africa [ 6 ] .	1
1516	PCR confirmation of @DISEASE$ was performed either at the local laboratories of the participating PICUs using influenza - specific PCR , or ( in the majority of cases ) at the central laboratory at the Institute of Virology and Immunobiology of the University of Würzburg using multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses	1
1517	For the latter , respiratory samples were placed in a viral transport medium ( Mast Diagnostica GmbH , Reinfeld , Germany )	1
1518	At the central laboratory , they were tested using the commercial multiplex PCR ' FTD ® Respiratory pathogens 21 ' ( Fast Track Diagnostics , Luxembourg ) to screen for respiratory viruses ( sensitivity and specificity of 99 - 100 % compared to singleplex PCR assays for all included viruses in clinical samples )	1
1519	Pathogens detected by the test kit included @DISEASE$ A and B viruses , @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , parainfluenza virus ( PIV ) 1 - 4 , coronavirus ( CoV ) NL63 , OC43 , HKU1 , and 229E , human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) , human bocavirus ( hBoV ) , adenovirus ( AdV ) , rhinovirus ( RhV ) , enterovirus ( EV ) , @DISEASE$ ( PV ) , and additionally @DISEASE$	1
1520	Samples positive for influenza A and B virus RNA in th@GENE$  analysed to determine the subtype and lineage , respectively	1
1521	Primers and probes specific for influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 were i@GENE$ atory pathogens 21 ' ki@GENE$ influenza A virus RNA but negativ@GENE$ s ( H1N1 ) pdm09 @GENE$  influenza A virus H3 .	1
1522	Given these sociopolitical issues that characterize epidemics , a comparative analysis of the narratives on the politics of epidemics is relevant	1
1523	To date , most of the narratives in the scholarly literature on the politics of epidemics have considered one epidemic in one context ( Dong 2008 ; Morinet et al	1
1524	2016 ; Nyenswah et al	1
1525	2014 )	1
1526	We hypothesize that the narratives may vary depending on the kind and context of the epidemic .	1
1527	Vibratome sections ( 250 μm thick ) of the floor of the fourth ventricle of the brains of infant Wistar rats ( between 9 and 15 days of age ) were prepared to allow ependymal cilia to be viewed on an inverted microscope using a × 40 objective lens	1
1528	Each section was submerged under 4 ml of media 199 ( M199 , Gibco , Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) , as described previously [ 16 ] .	1
1529	The impact of both antibody and low pH suggested @GENE$ involvement [ 34 , 35 ]	1
1530	We knocked down @GENE$ in HEC - 1A cells , verifying lower expression by flow cytometry and by Western blot ( Figure S3A )	1
1531	The knock - down HEC - 1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as did the wild - type cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that @GENE$ knockdown did not affect the ability to form tight junctions	1
1532	Unlike with wild - type HEC - 1A cells , there was no enhanced transcytosis with FcRn - knockdown HEC - 1A cells when either @GENE$ ( Figure 2A ) or polyclonal HIVIG ( data not shown ) were used	1
1533	We also evaluated @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
1534	A mutant designed to abrogate @GENE$ binding ( I253A ) , markedly lowered transcytosis compared with @GENE$ ( Figure 2B ) [ 36 ]	1
1535	The second mutant ( M428L ) , designed to bind with higher affinity to @GENE$ , increased transcytosis compared with @GENE$ ( Figure 2B ) [ 37 ]	1
1536	Binding to @GENE$ ( Figure S3B ) and neutralization of @GENE$ ( Figure S3C ) were nearly equivalent for the wild - type and @GENE$ mutant versions of @GENE$ , indicating that the Fc mutations did not affect @GENE$ - antigen binding	1
1537	Blockade of @GENE$ with	1
1538	In 2009 , the MOH initiated the National Antimicrobial Taskforce ( NAT ) that helped lay down the basics of mandatory surveillance , stewardship , and infection prevention principles in public restructured hospitals	1
1539	The NAT was tasked to formulate hospital programs and policies , as well as to implement measure for monitoring and evaluation of these policies	1
1540	It was later reorganized into the National Antimicrobial Resistance Control Committee ( NARCC ) in 2014	1
1541	Participants highlighted that the strategy adopted to keep efforts sustainable was by working with people on the ground to reinforce the implementation of these programs	1
1542	The MOH ' s knack for looking at global health issues and comparing itself to other countries also helped in funding and formulation of AMR strategies	1

1544	The @DISEASE$ ( DWV ) is a prevalent virus in honeybees with a broad host range spanning at least eight insect orders and three orders of Arachnida [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
1545	This virus is a positive sense single - stranded RNA virus and a harmful honeybee pathogen [ 22 ] , of which at least three distinct genotypes or master variants - type A , B , and C - are known [ 21 ]	1
1546	DWV can cause clinical symptoms such as @DISEASE$ , a shortened abdomen , and a reduced host lifespan [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]	1
1547	Driven by efficient vector transmission via ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor , DWV has become ubiquitous [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] .	1
1548	Representative 3 mm - thick brain tissue sections for immunohistochemical analysis were mounted on silane - coated slides as described by Ramos - Vara [ 49 ]	1

1551	The samples were then treated for color development with the DAB Detection Kit ( Ventana Medical Systems , Germany )	1
1552	The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and delivers the @GENE$ into the cytoplasm	1
1553	Viral DNA synthesis begins shortly after the appearance of the @GENE$ and the temporal program of @GENE$ gene expression ends with the appearance of the @GENE$ , which constitute the @GENE$ of the virus	1
1554	Finally , the virus undergoes a lytic cycle	1

1559	@GENE$ has a unique dual and stereoscopic protection mechanism that includes @GENE$ activity in the nucleus and @GENE$ activity in the cytoplasm	1

1562	Although mosquitoes serve as vectors of many pathogens of public health importance , their response to @DISEASE$ is poorly understood	1
1563	It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response	1
1564	Here , we have used an RNA - Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) infection , identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated	1
1565	Ubiqui@GENE$ rising 12 % of total differentially regulated genes , were selected for further validation by real time RT - qPCR and functional analysis	1
1566	It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor , MG - 132 , decreased @DISEASE$ titers , indicating importance of this pathway during infection process	1
1567	In infection models , the @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo , especially in midguts of mosquitoes	1
1568	Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that @GENE$ acts as a @GENE$ by degradation of @GENE$ via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway	1
1569	We also show that gene knockdown of @GENE$ leads to activation of the Jak @GENE$ pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva	1
1570	Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by @DISEASE$ to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication .	1
1571	These recent structural and biochemical studies complement in vivo studies of the @GENE$ in C	1
1572	elegans	1
1573	Dahlberg and Juo ( 2014 ) showed that the C	1
1574	elegans homologs of @GENE$ and @GENE$ form a stable ternary complex with @GENE$ in HEK293T cells	1
1575	Consistent with prior studies ( Cohn et al	1
1576	, 2009 ; Kee et al	1
1577	, 2010 ; Faesen et al	1
1578	, 2011 ) , full activation of C	1
1579	elegans @GENE$ catalytic activity in vitro requires both @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 )	1
1580	In contrast to the increased degradation of @GENE$ observed in @GENE$ loss - of - function mutants ( Kowalski et al	1
1581	, 2011 ) , overexpression of @GENE$ in neurons does not stabilize @GENE$ ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 )	1
1582	However , co - expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in neurons did increase surface and total levels of @GENE$ as well as glutamate - dependent behavior in an @GENE$ - dependent manner	1
1583	These data suggest that endogenous @GENE$ and @GENE$ may be limiting in vivo	1
1584	Together with data showing that co - expression of the @GENE$ reduces levels of @GENE$ ( Dahlberg and Juo , 2014 ) , these results support a model wherein @GENE$ , when bound to @GENE$ and @GENE$ , deubiquitinates @GENE$ and increases receptor stability and function in vivo .	1
1585	Next , we wanted to detect and identify different @DISEASE$ - associated bacterial pathogens in underfive children	1
1586	Conventional microbiological culture methods and biochemical tests were used to isolate and identify bacterial pathogens in the specimens	1
1587	Among 200 symptomatic specimens , 43 specimens ( 21	1
1588	5 % ) came out as culture positive ( Fig 2A ) .	1
1589	@GENE$ are used for tagging sequences also in multiple sequence alignments and sequence - based phylogenetic trees in various presentations including publications [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] )	1
1590	Notwithstanding UniProt / SwissProt [ 2 ] entry names ( Table 1 ) , these machine - readable IDs are not very informative in human communications	1
1591	Consequently , @GENE$ are commonly replaced by biologically meaningful names and acronyms , e	1

1610	Limited data is available on @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) caused by @DISEASE$ worldwide	1

1612	The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence - based studies and case reports , clinical experience and critical consensus discussions	1
1613	While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for @DISEASE$ , clinical illness due to @DISEASE$ in cats is rare	1
1614	The prevalence rates of feline infection with @DISEASE$ in serological or molecular - based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %	1
1615	Cats are able to infect sand flies and , therefore , they may act as a secondary reservoir , with dogs being the primary natural reservoir	1
1616	The most common clinical signs and @DISEASE$ abnormalities compatible with @DISEASE$ include @DISEASE$ node enlargement and @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ ( mainly on the head or distal limbs ) , @DISEASE$ ( mainly @DISEASE$ ) , feline @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and mild @DISEASE$	1
1617	Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence , as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy	1
1618	Diagnosis is based on serology , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , cytology , histology , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) or culture	1
1619	If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with @DISEASE$ , the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods ( cytology , histology with IHC , PCR , culture ) should be employed	1
1620	The most common treatment used is allopurinol	1
1621	Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases	1
1622	Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy	1
1623	Follow - up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests , serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses	1
1624	Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available .	1
1625	Regardless of age , @DISEASE$ is an important risk factor for @DISEASE$	1

1633	The use of an endogenous IC has allowed the validation of the use of swabs to detect the target pathogens	1
1634	The level of a pathogen on a swab not only depends on the pathogen abundance at the site sampled but also on the amount of sample effort	1
1635	However , it is reasonable to assume that this latter factor will also dictate the amount of reference DNA harvested	1
1636	Hence , the use of an endogenous IC compensates for any variability in sample effort - a potential confounding factor when using swabs to collect samples	1
1637	However , caution is required when comparing swabbed material with tissue samples	1
1638	Relative quantification is the ratio of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) to the reference squirrel DNA ( @GENE$ )	1
1639	Thus , if the sampling method harvests host cells poorly in comparison to viral particles , then an artificially high viral load may be indicated	1
1640	This may , in part , explain why arm swabs yielded by far the highest RQ of SQPV in grey squirrels ( Fig	1
1641	2 )	1
1642	Unsurprisingly , arm swabs show a poorer harvest of squirrel DNA in comparison to other sample types ( Online Resource S10 , Fig	1
1643	S10	1
1644	1 )	1
1645	Yet , in terms of absolute quantities , arm swabs show a proportionally higher number of DNA copies of the @GENE$ ( Online Resource S10 , Fig	1
1646	S10	1
1647	1 )	1
1648	Therefore , the high levels of @GENE$ in arm swabs appear genuine , a conclusion supported by the infection levels in skin sampled from the same site in red squirrels ( see Figs	1
1649	2 and 3 ) .	1
1650	Best multiplex primer and probe panels were derived from AlleleID ® ( Table 1 ; see Online Resource S7 , Fig	1
1651	S7	1
1652	1 for positions on @GENE$ ) ; secondary structures ( hairpins , homo - and hetero - dimerization ) of @GENE$ , probes and templates were assessed within the software used	1
1653	All undesirable secondary structures had a delta G ( ΔG ) > − 2 and melting temperature ( T m ) at least 30 ° C less than the chosen T a	1
1654	These suggested inhibitory secondary structures at the reaction temperature were highly unlikely to form and thus have little detrimental effect on the desired PCR reaction	1
1655	@GENE$ were confirmed to be the same as predicted target sequences ( Online Resource S7 , Fig	1
1656	S7	1
1657	2 - 7	1
1658	7 )	1
1659	Brief comparisons between SYBR ® green and hydrolysis probe methods demonstrated that both chemistries yielded comparable values of C p	1
1660	Moreover , completing the assays as either @GENE$ or @GENE$ had little impact on C p values	1
1661	( A summary of these results is provided in the Online Resource S8 , Fig	1

1664	Optimal primer / probe concentrations varied between 200 and 400 nm for uniplex reactions ( Table 1 )	1
1665	While satisfactory efficiencies ( i	1
1666	e	1
1667	E > 90 % but < 110 % ) with duplex reactions were achieved using the same primer / probe concentrations as for uniplex reactions ( see Online Resource S8 , Fig	1
1668	S8	1
1669	2 - 3 for standard curves ) , triplex reactions required @GENE$ and probes to be of equal concentration ( 200 nM ; as per the manufacturer ' s recommendation ) to achieve reaction efficiencies comparable to those recorded in duplex reactions ( Fig	1
1670	1 )	1
1671	All assays had maximised amplification over a 5 - 10 ° C range in T a , with a T a of 60 ° C acceptable for all assays ( Table 1 )	1
1672	A total of 200 ng of total DNA per reaction provided the best compromise between obtaining a low C p value and maintaining assay sensitivity for both multiplexes .	1
1673	Little is known about the role of the TLR7 / 8 @GENE$ pathway in @DISEASE$ ; however , TLR7 was shown to suppre@GENE$ TV replication within neurons of the brain although it did not affect pathogenesis [ 132 ]	1
1674	What we are aware of ; no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3 - TRIF pathway in @DISEA@GENE$ owever , several studies have looked at the prevalence of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene in @DISEASE$ patients [ 133 ] [ 134 ] @GENE$  ] [ 136 ]	1
1675	In particular , one polymorphism has been investigated the T allele in rs3775291	1
1676	This polymorphism has been shown to reduce TLR3 signaling by about 30 % [ 137 ]	1
1677	Alt@GENE$  the data regarding TLR3 is somewhat conflicting , Grygorczuk @GENE$ 	1
1678	hypothesized that a functional TLR3 facilitates the onset of @DISEASE$ [ @GENE$  by supporting the penetration through the blood brain barrier , but has a protective effect during the established @DISEASE$ [ 134 ]	1
1679	The differences between studies might also be connected to the different subtypes of the @DISEASE$ strain and the genetic background of the studied populations [ 134 ] .	1
1680	Diagnostic performances of BAL fluid cellular components , @GENE$ concentration , and @GENE$ concentration for the prediction of @DISEASE$ 	1
1681	The @GENE$ are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses [ 156 ]	1
1682	The @GENE$ specific @GENE$ was identified to interact with LGTV @GENE$ in a yeast two - hybrid screen	1
1683	@GENE$ expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of @GENE$	1
1684	Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to @DISEASE$ as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by TRIM79α nor did @GENE$ interact@GENE$ 5 of WNV [ 147@GENE$ 	1
1685	While phylogenetic studies can build robust family trees , they do so by focusing only on a limited number of " informative " genomic locations [ 44 ]	1
1686	Even though the @GENE$ is broken into eight separate @GENE$ , unless an individual is infected with two strains simultaneously ( providing an opportunity for reassortment ) , all eight sections are inherited as a set in a form of linkage [ 36 ]	1
1687	Thus , neutral and slightly deleterious mutations are carried along with those mutations under positive or purifying selection	1
1688	This gives us enough information to make many phylogenetic inferences , and we have a wealth of data telling us the history of the various viral lines , but these phylogenetic techniques ignore genetic change within a larger portion of the genome in order to focus on the phylogenetically - informative sites	1
1689	There is abundant evidence for multiple substitutions in specific places that are , in turn , sites of active selection [ 42 ] , but what about the rest of the genome ? Fitch , et al	1
1690	[ 36 ] noted that the main strategy of @DISEASE$ viruses was to outrun the immune system of the host by maintaining a high mutation rate	1
1691	They wondered " why such a virus does not accumulate so many deleterious mutations as to die of its own ineptitude	1
1692	" They further wondered if the only reason @DISEASE$ viruses continued to circulate in mammalian species was because of a sort of " gene therapy " through reassortment with stronger , less mutated avian viruses .	1
1693	In summary , @GENE$ and their expression kinetics in CPV - infected F81 cells were characterised with @GENE$ analysis	1
1694	There were dynamic changes in @GENE$ over the course of infection	1
1695	@GENE$ that are involved in viral defence or apoptosis and are related to @DISEASE$ may be useful for studying anti - viral and oncolytic therapy	1
1696	Finally ,	1
1697	A total of 200 measurements were made for ciliary beat frequency , 100 for ependymal cilia and 100 for respiratory cilia	1
1698	There was no significant difference ( paired t test , P = 0	1
1699	64 ) in the ciliary beat frequency obtained using the direct counting and ciliaFA methods ( n = 200 )	1

1704	All qPCR reactions were carried out using white 96 - well plates sealed with optical clear caps ( Primer Design , Southampton , UK ) and were run in a LightCycler ® 480 II real - time cycler ( Roche , Welwyn Garden City , UK ) , unless otherwise stated .	1
1705	The essential oil of Cheistocalyx operculatus , which chemical composition was not determined , significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced secretion of @GENE$ and TNF - α @GENE$ in RAW 264	1
1706	7 cells , a mouse macrophage - like cell line [ 103 ]	1
1707	However , and some years earlier , some authors had already reported that tea tree oil ( Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel	1
1708	) , mainly its major component ( terpinen - 4 - ol ) , was able to suppress the production in vitro of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , as well as @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ by LPS - activated human blood monocytes [ 106 ]	1
1709	Six years later , Caldefie et al	1
1710	( 2006 ) [ 107 ] also reported the capacity of the essential oil of that species for suppressing @GENE$ and stimulating the secretion of the @GENE$ in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( monocytes and lymphocytes ) stimulated by the lectin @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) from Phaseolus vulgaris L	1
1711	. Also using @GENE$ from Phaseolus vulgaris for stimulating mononuclear cells , Hammer et al	1
1712	( 2000 ) [ 108 ] reported that the essential oils of Taxandria fragrans ( J	1

1725	The mixture of stereoisomers geranial ( E - isomer ) and neral ( Z - isomer ) , known as citral , constitutes the main components of Cymbopogon citratus ( DC ) Stapf	1
1726	( lemongrass ) essential oil	1
1727	This essential oil revealed to be capable to suppress @GENE$ and @GENE$ in LPS - stimulated peritoneal macrophages of normal mice [ 117 ]	1
1728	The same authors attributed similar properties to the eugenol , the main component present in the essential oil of Syzygium aromaticum ( L	1
1729	) Merr	1
1730	et Perry ( clove ) [ 118 ]	1
1731	Other authors also found that eugenol on human macrophages ( U937 ) under the stimulation of LPS blocked the release of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and PGE 2 [ 119 ]	1
1732	Whether some essential oils are able to inhibit the production of @GENE$ such as @GENE$ , some of them , particularly lemongrass , geranium and spearmint and their main components ( citral , geraniol , citronellol , and carvone ) , can also suppress @GENE$ - induced neutrophil adherence responses [ 120 ]	1
1733	According to these authors , those essential oils or their major components do not affect @GENE$ but do affect the neutrophil function to suppress their adhesion	1
1734	Therefore and concerning lemongrass and citral and as reported above , they can also suppress @GENE$ and IL - 6 @GENE$ [ 117 ]	1
1735	In other work , Lin et al	1
1736	( 2008 ) [ 121 ] Therefore , the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be , at least in part , due to the inhibition of @GENE$ release from macrophages , according to the same authors [ 122 ] .	1
1737	Much of the work examining reservoir responses to hantaviruses has been conducted in rats infected with @DISEASE$ and deer mice infected with @DISEASE$ or ANDV	1
1738	Using cDNA arrays , Klein et al	1
1739	[ 77 ] identified nearly 2000 genes that were differentially expressed in male and female rats infected with @@GENE$ ri@GENE$ ly member genes were significantly higher in females , which may reduce transmission from females .	1
1740	The @GENE$ is composed of an @GENE$ and a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
1741	@GENE$ contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , particularly in early @DISEASE$ ( 21 )	1

1743	6 % of RT - PCRpositive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ .	1
1744	The etiology of @DISEASE$ exacerbations was considered as infectious if the episodes were concomitant to a @DISEASE$ documented by the clinical examination and / or laboratory or radiologic investigations ; as allergic when there had been a clear exposition to a likely triggering allergen in a susceptible individual ( known atopic or with a family history of @DISEASE$ or with previous @DISEASE$ episodes ) and with no concomitant @DISEASE$ ; as exerciseinduced when the exacerbation had been precipitated by physical activity ; if no overt cause could be ascertained , the etiology was classified as " unknown	1
1745	"	1
1746	The findings of this study revealed that nurses do not receive personal psychological support	1
1747	Even though the support structure is there in the hospital , their needs are not considered and attended to	1
1748	A study by Mametja [ 16 ] reported concerns that were raised by nurses , that they needed counselling , not only when they have contracted the disease , but for them to cope with the demands of the high number of patients who no longer recover from the illness , but die as the result of @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$	1
1749	The findings of the present study agree with those of the study by Arjun [ 25 ] , which concluded that nurses caring for @DISEASE$ patients did not receive psychological support from the clinical psychologists when they need it ; neither was there a functional employee assistance programme available at the institution .	1
1750	The levels of infection markers , such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ showed no difference between the two groups	1
1751	In addition , total bilirubin and creatinine levels showed no significant difference between the two groups .	1
1752	Reactivation of herpes group viruses may also be one of the factors associated with @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT	1
1753	Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and human herpes virus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation	1
1754	They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [ 27 , 28 ]	1
1755	Recently , a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients ( donor or recipient CMV seropositive ) transplanted for @DISEASE$ was performed to evaluate the associations of @DISEASE$ and disease with recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
1756	It was found that @DISEASE$ infection was associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$ stage [UNK] 2 and @DISEASE$ grade [UNK] 2 [ 29 ]	1
1757	However , their effects on posttransplant @DISEASE$ recurrence still remain questionable	1
1758	Data showed that short - term @DISEASE$ does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [ 30 ] .	1
1759	@DISEASE$ ( syn	1
1760	@DISEASE$ is found both in the Old and New Worlds with dogs as the main reservoir	1
1761	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is an important and complex zoonotic disease whose transmission , pathogenesis , clinical manifestations , diagnosis , therapy and prevention have been extensively studied [ 1 , 2 ]	1
1762	Conversely , in the last century , the cat was usually considered as a relatively resistant host species to @DISEASE$ based on two experimental studies ( see Question 5 ) and on limited numbers of clinical case reports and histopathological descriptions of the presence of @DISEASE$ in necropsies .	1
1763	The implication of @DISEASE$ as a cause of some of these clinical signs has been associated with the presence of the parasite in cytological or histopathological examinations of liver , spleen , lymph nodes , stomach , large bowel , kidney , oral mucosa , nasal exudate and eye tissues [ 13 , 14 , 36 , 50 , 57 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 72 ]	1
1764	However , clinical disease is commonly associated with an impaired immunocompetence due to several causes including @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ and FeLV ) , immunosuppressive treatment and concomitant debilitating diseases such as @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ [ 44 ] .	1

1771	Our evolutionary screen also revealed strong signatures of positive selection in @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
1772	Strikingly , these three genes encode the only three @GENE$ that contain both a @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and are the only @GENE$ to encode more than one @GENE$	1
1773	The @GENE$ is unique among @GENE$ in its ability to recognize @GENE$ [ 47 ]	1
1774	Furthermore , some @GENE$ have recently been shown to catalyze the removal of mono - ADPr [ 15 , 16 ]	1
1775	Although the molecular functions of @GENE$ are unclear , the presence of both @GENE$ and @GENE$ may conceivably allow them to both add and specifically recognize and / or reverse protein ADP - ribosylation	1
1776	This , combined with the presence of @GENE$ in viruses , prompted us to explore in more depth the evolution of other @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
1777	Apart from the @GENE$ , we found no evidence for positive selection in any other @GENE$ encoding a @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that the combination of the @GENE$ is important for their rapid evolution and , consequently , for their putative antiviral roles .	1

1847	Several isolated studies have been conducted since the H5N1 outbreak in late 2003 to monitor the molecular evolution at gene and genome level [ 8 ] , [ 9 ]	1
1848	All these studies involve a phylogenetic analysis at one level or the other	1
1849	However , no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful results for the analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 viruses in particular and @DISEASE$ viruses in general .	1
1850	None of the children were treated with antibiotics in the 7 days prior to FOB + BAL .	1
1851	The results outlined above highlight the pitfalls of making a priori assumptions concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating parameters	1
1852	Depending on the precise details , inappropriate model selection may give rise to either gross over - or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection	1
1853	However , even when parameter estimates are reliable , choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations concerning individual - level control strategies	1
1854	Historically , it has been shown that contact tracing and the effective quarantine of infected individuals and those potentially exposed is an important means of infection management [ 13 , 39 , 40 ]	1
1855	We introduce both these measures into the @GENE$ epidemic model , assuming that there is a small delay in detecting newly infectious individuals , which may represent an asymptomatic phase or uncertainty in diagnosing symptoms ( see Methods and Protocol S1 )	1
1856	As we show in Figure 4 , the precise levels of isolation of infected individuals and of quarantining contacts required to control the outbreak and the predicted level of disease incidence are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed @GENE$ model or a more realistic framework is used .	1
1857	Susceptibility based antibiotic treatment in patients with a significant BAL - culture is routine in our centre	1
1858	In general , antibiotics are administered orally for 10 days ( daily dose : 50 - 75 mg / kg for amoxicillin or amoxicillinclavulanate )	1
1859	7 Of 16 ( 43 , 8 % ) patients responded well to treatment , in 3 of 16 ( 18 , 8 % ) no change in symptoms was noted , and data were missing for 6 patients	1
1860	In 4 of 7 ( 57 , 1 % ) responders however , symptoms relapsed within 2 - 3 weeks after completion of the antibiotic treatment	1
1861	In one of these patients , FOB + BAL was repeated 70 days after the initial procedure	1
1862	NTHi ( > 10 5 colony forming units ( cfu ) / ml ) that was present as sole pathogen in the first BAL fluid was cultured again together with S	1
1863	pneumoniae ( > 10 5 cfu / ml ) .	1
1864	Motivation : This method can work well when the given input structure has a small number of @GENE$ from G big , because G updated contains stems that includes these @GENE$ , but avoids " overcrowding " with further @GENE$ that might prevent @GENE$ from finding pseudoknotted stems .	1
1865	The study highlighted the plight of nurses when caring for patients suffering from @DISEASE$	1
1866	Nurses indicated their emotional distress due to fear of contagion , lack of material resources , as well as poor infection control practices	1
1867	The Occupational Health and Safety Act stipulates measures and standards of practice , however such standards are jeopardized by inadequate financial and resource allocation in the public sector	1
1868	Nurses expressed the need for in - service education and support by managers	1
1869	Managers must ensure that nurses have resources to maintain quality nursing care and receive social and psychological support as they face death on a daily basis	1
1870	While available resources are limited , there is a need to direct resources to the problem , to improve quality of services in the @DISEASE$ wards .	1
1871	Nurse ( N1 ) said : " I believe that it is important to have meetings with doctors and other management to give us in - service training and workshop	1
1872	"	1
1873	To find the memory usage of the programs , we use the Valgrind package [ 66 ] and record the total heap usage as memory usage of each program	1
1874	@GENE$ and @GENE$ are completely written in C and so we can easily find their memory usage by running @GENE$	1
1875	However , @GENE$ program is a perl script that runs a few @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) sequentially	1
1876	So we find the memory usage of each C component using @GENE$ and assign the maximum as the memory usage of @GENE$ .	1
1877	Studies of synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal much about @GENE$ [ 25 ]	1
1878	The overall codon usage among 48 @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ was analyzed in this study	1
1879	First , the ENC values of all the poliovirus samples were analyzed , and the results showed that the majority of polioviruses do not have a strong codon bias ( mean ENC = 53	1
1880	754 > 40 )	1
1881	In addition , together with published data on codon usage bias among some RNA viruses , such as BVDV , H5N1 Table 4 Correlation analysis between the A , U , C , G contents and A 3 , U 3 , C 3 , G 3 influenza virus and SARS - covs with mean values of 51	1
1882	43 , 50	1
1883	91 and 48	1
1884	99 , respectively , one possible explanation for this is that the weak codon bias of RNA virus is advantageous to replicate efficiently in vertebrate host cells , with potentially distinct codon preferences [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]	1
1885	Natural selection and mutation pressure are thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]	1
1886	In this study , the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure , rather than natural selection is the mainly factors on codon usage pattern of polioviruses .	1
1887	Significant @DISEASE$ was evident in 5 / 35 ( 14 % ) of people with @DISEASE$ in the UK , 4 / 15 cases ( 16 % ) in Hong Kong and 104 / 215 cases ( 48 % ) in Sichuan province ' s outbreak [ 2 , 7 , 15 ]	1
1888	In our study , @DISEASE$ were reported in 33 / 101 ( 33 % ) of @DISEASE$ patients compared to 18 / 303 ( 6 % ) of hospital controls and 11 / 300 ( 4 % ) of community controls ( Table 3 )	1
1889	These minor @DISEASE$ may allow direct entry of the bacteria in people with direct contact with infected pigs or pork	1
1890	Contact with pigs within the last two weeks in the presence of @DISEASE$ was associated with a significant high risk of infection ( Table 6 )	1
1891	@DISEASE$ were most often recorded in slaughter house workers , cooks and housewives involved in processing meat	1
1892	Skin protection , including gloves , hand washing and exclusion of people with obvious @DISEASE$ from direct contact with pigs and pork meat , may help to reduce the incidence of the disease .	1
1893	Data were received from 610 cases of @DISEASE$ diagnosed in Australia between January 2014 and September 2018 from 11 animal shelters , 2 rescue societies and 11 veterinary hospitals	1
1894	Of the 610 cases , 87 % were shelter - housed , 12 % were privately owned cats presenting to veterinary hospitals , and 1 % were from foster carers working with rescue societies without premises	1
1895	The distribution of Australian cases by geographic region and year is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1	1
1896	Figure S1 ) .	1
1897	Tables I and II summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients from whom the samples were collected	1
1898	@GENE$ identified 16 different proteins that had ≥ 1	1
1899	5 - fold differences in expression level between the patients with HBV - induced @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , respectively , and the healthy controls ( Table III ) .	1
1900	The roll of B cells and plasma cells in @DISEASE$ is controversial ( summarized Table 3 )	1
1901	Much of the B cell and antibody data reviewed herein show inconsistent , contradictory or unsubstantiated findings	1
1902	Pathological specimens and model systems are variably supportive or inconsistent with what is known from human studies	1
1903	Although B cell and plasma cell infiltration in pathology specimens is intriguing , whether they are bystanders activated by a superantigen effect , are respondin@GENE$ ntigen revealed by inflammation , or specific against an infectious etiology , is currently unknown	1
1904	Like the mouse models and attempts at developing new therapeutics , it is hard to be confident in any one approach without knowledge of the etiology	1
1905	Although published B cell studies relating to @DISEASE$ are somewhat inconsistent , recent data using advanced sequencing techniques show promise for identification of an etiology	1
1906	Since @DISEASE$ is a clinical syndrome without a definitive marker of diagnosis , many of the studies may be influenced by " generous " case definitions of the study participants	1
1907	Most of the studies reviewed do not include detailed clinical information or rigorous case definitions	1
1908	This is a general problem with the literature in this field ; these machinations seem more consistent in clinical trials and epidemiological studies but are rare in bench - science studies	1
1909	This potential selection bias may be negatively influencing reproducible , definitive findings and conclusions	1
1910	This is a rich opportunity for clinical investigators	1
1911	Rigorous studies are needed on those children who present with @DISEASE$	1
1912	If any pulmonary findings are found , bronchial washings should be obtained and stored for potential molecular diagnostics	1
1913	Other samples , such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum , should be taken and banked for future studies	1
1914	Thorough autopsy evaluation should be pursued on any subjects who succumb during the acute or convalescent phases of @DISEASE$	1
1915	Improved reporting and national registries would go a long way in establishing a representative pool of patients	1
1916	Studi@GENE$ tly ongoing on peripheral cytokine profiles , B cells and PBs may show a consistent marker to help define who has @DISEASE$	1
1917	A correlative diagnostic marker , possibly even antibody derived , would be a highly desirable first step in future studies .	1
1918	Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7	1
1919	0 ( GraphPad Software )	1
1920	All data were analyzed using an unpaired t test or two - way ANOVA with Sidak ' s post - test to correct for multiple comparisons , as indicated in the corresponding figure legends	1
1921	A P value < 0	1
1922	05 was considered significant .	1
1923	Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the LPS - induced @DISEASE$ loss	1
1924	In our previous investigation , activated microglia was most accumulated in mainly temporal association area , 8 h after the LPS insult	1
1925	Neurons in this area were reported to be related to @DISEASE$	1
1926	In addition , the association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , especially in Lateral amygdala 26 , 27 , is well known	1
1927	Moreover , the amygdala interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28	1
1928	Based on those findings , we subsequently performed Nissl staining and evaluated the number of neurons in the amygdala , cerebral cortex , and hippocampus to investigate the brain regions related to the results of the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure	1
1929	The quantitative results revealed significant reductions in the number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex in the LPS - treated offspring than in the Control group ( p < 0	1
1930	001 and p < 0	1
1931	001 , respectively ; Fig	1
1932	3A , panels a , b , d , e and 3B ) , but not in the hippocampus ( Fig	1
1933	S1 )	1
1934	The LPS - induced @DISEASE$ in the amygdala and cerebral cortex was improved in the HW + LPS group than in the LPS group ( p < 0	1
1935	05 and p < 0	1
1936	05 , respectively ; Fig	1
1937	3A , panels c , f and 3B )	1
1938	Maternal H 2 administration attenuated LPS - induced oligodendrocytic loss and suppressed astrocytic activation	1
1939	The pathophysiologic mechanisms of the @DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ are incompletely understood ; however , under @DISEASE$ , activated astrocyte was reported to have a potential cause an adverse effect on neurons and oligodendrocyte , which would result in the abnormal behaviors in later life 29	1
1940	The number of oligodendrocytes was evaluated by using Olig2 , a transcriptio@GENE$ or i@GENE$ entiation of cells in the oligodendroglial lineage , and a mature oligodendrocyte marker 30 , 31	1
1941	Compared with the Control group , the number of Olig2 - positive cells was clearly reduced in the white matter , amygdala , and cerebral cortex in the @DISEASE$ group ( p < 0	1
1942	01 , p < 0	1
1943	05 , and p < 0	1
1944	05 , respectively ; Fig	1
1945	4A , panels a , b , d , e , g , h and 4C )	1
1946	H 2 treatment completely blocked the LPS - induced decrease of Olig2 - positive cells in all three regions ( p < 0	1

1951	The viral load can return to the pretransplant values within 4 days after transplantation and may be influenced by the usage of corticosteroids [ 5 ]	1
1952	@DISEASE$ occurs between 2 - 5 months after transplant , and it is characterized by @DISEASE$ [ 4 ]	1
1953	In the early reinfection stage , the @DISEASE$ injury occurs only after 3 weeks	1
1954	@DISEASE$ is established about 6 - 12 months after transplantation	1
1955	The stage of @DISEASE$ is characterized by a decrease of viral load and a pattern of @DISEASE$	1
1956	A variant form of posttransplant @DISEASE$ is @DISEASE$ that occurs in < 10 % of patients , frequently associated with high viral load and immunosuppression	1
1957	Usually , it occurs within 1 - 6 months after transplant and can progress to @DISEASE$ in 3 - 6 months [ 6 ]	1
1958	This form is characterized by very high viral load , cellular ballooning , low inflammation , and a Th2 intrahepatic immunological response	1
1959	These features suggest that the @DISEASE$ is due to a direct @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ .	1
1960	Therefore , the results of this paper highlight how difficult it can be to address @DISEASE$ , especially when considering that Singapore has well - functioning stewardship programs , comprehensive hospital surveillance systems , and some of the latest technologies and innovations to address it	1
1961	The example of @DISEASE$ in Singapore brings to light the increasing need to address the social , economic , political , cultural , and behavioral aspects influencing @DISEASE$ rather than just focusing on the technical solutions	1
1962	Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response , it will be difficult to design appropriate policy interventions	1
1963	In the next paragraphs we provide an example of each of these aspects to highlight their importance in the Singaporean setting	1
1964	We address " the social " by analyzing how @DISEASE$ has been socially constructed in Singapore ; we discuss the influence of " politics " by considering power relations and governance approaches for the successful control of @DISEASE$ ; we address " behavioral aspects " by analyzing vested interests ; and we consider " cultural components " by exploring how patients ' cultural beliefs influence antibiotic consumption .	1

1967	The quarantine of exposed persons ( along with the isolation of infected persons ) has been properly described as the most complex and most ethically and legally controversial intervention within the jurisdiction of public health [ 19 ]	1
1968	Complexity and controversy notwithstanding , the present data indicate a very high rate of public acceptance of quarantine as a means to control the spread of @DISEASE$	1
1969	Indeed , the vast majority of respondents indicated strong support for the use of quarantine in an @DISEASE$ outbreak , for legal penalties against absconders , for social supports for those affected , and for public safeguards against potential inappropriate use .	1
1970	While we believe the data reported here contribute to the goal of better planning and better preparedness , the present study is limited by its sample of respondents who were drawn only from the Greater Toronto Area	1
1971	Our goal was to assess the attitudes and perceptions of those living in an area significantly impacted by the @DISEASE$ outbreak , but further research is now required to determine the generalizability of the present findings to other geographic regions and other populations	1
1972	Also , our survey was conducted after the conclusion of the outbreak ; it is conceivable that public perceptions and attitudes toward the use of restrictive measures could be different during the course of an outbreak	1
1973	Finally , a relatively small proportion of our survey respondents were directly affected by quarantine during @DISEASE$ , which precluded any analysis of differences between those who were directly affected and those who were not .	1
1974	Peroxynitrite is formed by phagocytes for killing invading microorganisms , nevertheless if in high concentrations can oxidise several host biomolecules by nitration with the consequent cellular damages being responsible for diverse diseases [ 26 ] .	1
1975	The number of live and dead mice was counted every 12 hr for 5 days to investigate the viability in each TG line after the femoral muscle was challenged with 10 LD 50 PRV was ( Figure S4B )	1
1976	Figure 7B shows that the viability of @DISEASE$ mice challenged with PRV was 11 % ( 2 / 18 )	1
1977	The viabilities of the STG69 and STG135 lines against @DISEASE$ challenges were about 40 % ( 8 / 20 ) and 17 % ( 4 / 24 ) , respectively	1
1978	However , the STG90 line showed 53 % ( 9 / 17 ) viability	1
1979	These data were described by Kaplan - Meier analysis	1
1980	Mice generally began to exhibit clinical signs of illness 3 - 5 days post - challenge ( Figure 7C ) .	1
1981	HeLa cells were provided by the Korean Cell Line Bank and were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT , USA ) , 100 U / ml penicillinstreptomycin ( Hyclone ) , and non - essential amino acids ( Sigma , St	1

1983	HSV - GFP virus was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC Number : VR - 1544 )	1
1984	The PRV - YS strain was obtained from the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service ( NVRQS ) of Korea .	1
1985	The observation that overexpression of @GENE$ resulted in the inhibition of the CSFV @GENE$ activity prompted an examination of the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ of CSFV	1
1986	@GENE$ pulldown assay showed that the @GENE$ , but not the @GENE$ , could bind to @GENE$ in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 6A , B )	1
1987	Competitive RNA pulldown assay indicated that the association of @GENE$ with the @GENE$ could be inhibited by the unlabeled @GENE$ ( Figure 6C )	1
1988	The results demonstrated that @GENE$ binds to the @GENE$ and inhibits its activity .	1

2003	As mentioned , no viral , bacterial or parasitic agent was evidenced after a broad range of investigations , including blood culture	1
2004	In particular , virological screening included the following specific real - time RT - PCR assays : influenza A and B ; @DISEASE$ ; metapneumovirus ; PIV types 1 and 3 ; rhinovirus ; @DISEASE$ ; coronavirus ( HKU1 , NL63 , 229E and OC43 ) ; bocavirus ; adenovirus ; human herpesvirus 6 ; parvovirus B19 ; @DISEASE$ ; @DISEASE$ ; @DISEASE$	1
2005	She was also screened for antigen detection of adenovirus and rotavirus , and serological assays targeting IgM for @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE@GENE$ d @DISEASE$ were performed	1

2007	Analysis of public data sets The GeneNetwork suite of online programs , incorporating @GENE$ ( Chesler et al	1

2013	( 2011 )	1
2014	Genome - wide association analyses were performed using @GENE$ values measured on a log 2 scale	1
2015	Correlation analysis was performed with Pearson ' s correlation , and outliers were removed	1
2016	For interval mapping , likelihood ratio statistic ( LRS ) scores were plotted on the y - axis vs	1

2023	The genomic intervals analyzed were selected based on the location at which the @GENE$ peak crossed the suggested or significant LRS threshold	1
2024	Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was used to merge multiple @GENE$ expression traits into a single , synthetic trait that represented a cellspecific gene expression signature .	1
2025	Only individuals who consented to participate in the study through a telephone call and gave written consent at the time of study initiation underwent surveys at local public health centers	1
2026	Each participant responded to a questionnaire on exposure and provided a blood sample	1
2027	Following the first serologic test by an enzymelinked immunospecific assay ( ELISA ) , positive or borderline cases were tested using an immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) and a plaque reduction neutralization antibody test ( PRNT ) .	1
2028	Nucleic acids ( both DNA and RNA ) were extracted from 200 μL virus transport medium using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions .	1
2029	This study evaluated 350 banked serum samples collected in July 2012 from individuals with self - reported domestic animal exposure and controls in Jazan Region , KSA , for the presence of @GENE$	1
2030	None of the specimens tested positive using the MERS - S ppNT assay	1
2031	Our negative results suggest population naivety to @DISEASE$ in this region of KSA 1 month after the first earliest case was reported in another region of the country	1
2032	8 At the time samples were collected , there was no known evidence of human or animal infections with MERS - CoV from the Jazan region	1
2033	4 Since then multiple humans in Jazan have developed @DISEASE$ .	1
2034	Purification of @GENE$	1
2035	To purify the @GENE$ , we chose to use a Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) affinity chromatography column for @GENE$ and a glutathione sepharose [UNK] 4B column for @GENE$	1
2036	The two methods are similar as regards experimental procedures but differ in column chromatography and reagents , as described below : i ) Protein purification with Ni - NTA column	1
2037	The column was first equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7	1
2038	8 ) at five times the volume of the beads	1
2039	The sample was then loaded and allowed to flow slowly in order to maximize the amount of protein bound to the beads	1
2040	The flow - through solution was collected for SDS - PAGE analysis later	1
2041	After the sample was completely loaded , washing buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , pH 8	1

2046	The essential oil from the leaves of Juniperus oxycedrus L	1
2047	of the Iberian flora , mainly constituted by α - pinene , showed a great inhibition of @GENE$ - induced NO production in the human chondrocytic cell line C - 28 / 12	1
2048	The same oil and a α - pinene - rich fraction reduced markedly @GENE$ - induced @GENE$ degradation and phosphorylation , @GENE$ - DNA binding activity and NO production [ 152 ] .	1
2049	We further hypothesized that @GENE$ may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication	1
2050	To this end , we treated Veros with 500 µM DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h	1
2051	Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of @GENE$ ( Figure 4C )	1
2052	In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of @GENE$ with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3 - 2A 29K , - 3C 52R , or double protease mutant	1
2053	However , with DFMO treatment , @GENE$ cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A )	1
2054	When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of @GENE$ , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3	1
2055	In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 @GENE$ activity and that the @GENE$ derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity .	1
2056	Observing the development of resistance to DFMO and the emergence of mutants in the passaged virus , we cloned these mutations in the CVB3 parental strain using mutagenic PCR on the CVB3 infectious clone	1
2057	In addition to 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutants , we generated a @GENE$ / 3C 52R double mutant	1
2058	After confirming the presence of the mutations , we generated an infectious virus and measured the virus titer over several rounds of replication	1
2059	Vero cells were treated with 500 µM DFMO or left untreated for four days prior to infection at MOI 0	1
2060	01	1
2061	Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay	1
2062	As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of @GENE$ mutation	1
2063	However , in DFMO - treated cells , the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer , which persisted to 72 hpi	1
2064	Interestingly , the @GENE$ , either alone or in combination , exhibited a Following passage of virus , RNA was extracted , purified , reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced	1
2065	When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental @GENE$ , mutations in the two @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( Q29K ) and @GENE$ ( Q52R ) , were observed	1
2066	Interestingly , these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages	1
2067	Further , the 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutations were not observed in the same lineage	1
2068	Importantly , no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment .	1
2069	To determine whether the infectivity defect of HIV - 1 viral particles produced in the presence of IFITMs was target cell type specific , virions produced as described above were used to challenge primary monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) , MDMs or activated PBLs using appropriate Env pseudotypes ( Figure 1F )	1
2070	The infectivity of viral particles was then assessed by measuring the amount of GFP - positive cells 3 days afterwards	1
2071	Even using different target cells , viruses produced in the presence of IFITMs displayed a characteristic decrease in infectivity , indicating that this phenomenon is independent from the target cells .	1
2072	These results were integrated into a rich and exhaustive description of the lived experience .	1

2095	It was then repeated three times which made up to a total of 16 replicates ( 4 explants × 4 jars )	1
2096	Finally , the cultures were kept in culture room under dark condition at 25 ± 2 ∘ C	1
2097	Developed callus was collected after four weeks and dried in the oven at 50 ∘ C .	1

2105	One of the hurdles to understanding the role of @GENE$ in RNA virus cross - species transmission ( CST ) events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale	1
2106	In 2009 , the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (	1
2107	350 % ) in the number of gray foxes infected with a @DISEASE$ virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County	1
2108	To better understand the evolution of @DISEASE$ , deep - sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged @DISEASE$ virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak	1
2109	For each sample , approximately 11 k@GENE$ b genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform	1
2110	Average coverage was 17 , 4486and this allowed characterization of the @DISEASE$ virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths	1
2111	Phylogenetic anal@GENE$ us sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date ( 1995 vs	1
2112	2009 ) and geographic location ( northern vs	1
2113	southern )	1
2114	A single amino acid ch@GENE$ e G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks , suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region	1
2115	Deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were pre@GENE$ s sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003 - 2010 were present at the sub - consensus level ( as rare variants in the viral population ) in skunk and fox samples from 1995	1

2122	@GENE$ is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes during different cellular conditions	1
2123	One of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of @GENE$ over the infected cell surface , Further , we checked @GENE$ recruitment to the @GENE$ in LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cells by @GENE$ immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay	1
2124	Immunoprecipitation was conducted using an @GENE$ specific for the @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
2125	EGFP expression did not alter @GENE$ recruitment to @GENE$	1
2126	However , full - length or @GENE$ expression decreased @GENE$ recruitment to the @GENE$	1
2127	10 % of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample ( Figure 5B , upper panel )	1
2128	We also checked @GENE$ recruitment to @GENE$ , which showed a similar pattern as observed for the @GENE$ ( Figure 5B , lower panel )	1
2129	As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for @GENE$ , aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with @GENE$ ( specific for SP1 @GENE$ , which also binds to @GENE$ ) and purified @GENE$ was PCR amplified using @GENE$ specific primer	1
2130	As expected , @GENE$ recruitment to the @GENE$ was not altered in ORF2 expressing cells ( Figure 5C )	1
2131	These experiments confirmed that @GENE$ expression specifically prevents p65 @GENE$ association with its cognate response element present on @GENE$ .	1
2132	We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with @DISEASE$	1
2133	Notably , in the largest study that assessed severity , there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support , mechanical ventilation or who had died , and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12	1
2134	However , from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1	1

2153	PAB was confirmed to promote G2 / M arrest after 24 h ( Figure 6C )	1
2154	To assess the effects of PAB on @GENE$ and virulence , @DISEASE$ cells were infected with EV - D68 US / KY / 14 - 18953 strain or EV - A71 at an MOI of 0	1

2161	Furthermore , PAB decreased the TCID50 / ml value of both EV - D68 ( 80	1

2166	These results confirm that G2 / M arrest inhibits both the EV - D68 and EV - A71 strains , which suggest a common approach for therapeutic intervention that might potentially target a broader range of @DISEASE$ .	1

2168	To further examine the potential effect of virus infection on cell cycle transition from G2 / M phase into G0 / G1 , @DISEASE$ cells were treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h for G2 / M phase synchronization and then the cells were mock infected or infected with EV - D68 at 0	1

2170	Next , the cells were treated for an additional 24 h with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or fresh medium	1

2190	Therefore , EV - D68 infection also regulates the cell cycle by promoting exit from G2 / M phase	1
2191	Consistent with these findings , the express@GENE$ clin@GENE$ d CDK1 ( which mediate G2 / M progression ; Coverley et al	1

2194	CDK1 was decreased at the mRNA level upon EV - D68 infection ( transition fromP < 0	1

2196	Therefore , EV - D68 virus promotes cell cycle exit from G2 / M and entry into G0 / G1 by modifying the pathway of G0 / G1 entry at the transcriptional lev@GENE$ r CDK1 and at the post - translational lev@GENE$ clinB1 .	1
2197	As @DISEASE$ is the most common sign , apart from @DISEASE$ , FeL should be included in the differential list when this finding is noted on physical examination as solitary or generalized @DISEASE$	1
2198	This list mainly includes infections with other infectious agents ( FIV , FeLV , FCoV , Bartonella , Mycobacteria , T	1
2199	gondii , Cryptococcus or other @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ or metastatic involvement from other @DISEASE$ .	1
2200	@DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ is a common finding in FeL as also found in dogs [ 2 ] , and @DISEASE$ is occasionally reported [ 37 , 50 ] .	1
2201	To overcome the problem of immune tolerance in mouse models of HCV expression , we developed an HCV model in mice that relies on conditional expression of the @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ and the Cre / loxP switching system [ 5 , 6 ] ; we showed that the injection of an Ad - Cre vector enhanced the frequency of HCV - specific activated CD8 T cells in the liver of these mice and caused @DISEASE$	1
2202	However , the Ad - Cre adenovirus vector alone causes @DISEASE$ in wild - type mice	1
2203	Nevertheless , the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral pro@GENE$ LT level@GENE$ r 2 , 000 IU / L ) [ 5 ] ; HCV core @GENE$ re reduced and expression of this protein was transient ( about 2 weeks )	1
2204	Therefore , this Ad - Cre - dep@GENE$ nt model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to @DISEASE$ .	1
2205	Interestingly , immunization with @GENE$ rapidly suppressed the inflammatory response ; however , immunization with either of the other rVVs did not ( see Figure 6A )	1
2206	This result indicated that rVV - @GENE$ may modulate inflammation via innate immunity , as well as via acquired immunity	1
2207	Reportedly , Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) - dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [ 27 ]	1
2208	@GENE$ and @GENE$ have also been implicated in the recognition of the @DISEASE$ virus [ 28 , 29 ]	1
2209	These findings indicate that@GENE$  on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV - N25 in our model of @DISEASE$ infection ; however , further examination of this hypothesis is required	1
2210	The finding that pathological symptoms in the @DISEASE$ transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous @GENE$ n of@GENE$ g antibodies indicated that the progression of @DISEASE$ depende@GENE$ ines in serum , rather than@GENE$ E$ protein levels in hepatocytes	1

2212	Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of @DISEASE$ in mice fed a high - fat diet [ 34 ] , and pro@GENE$ of T@GENE$ and IL - 6 is elevated in @DISEASE$ mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [ 35 ]	1
2213	These findings indi@GENE$ both cytokines are responsible for HCV - triggered @DISEASE$ , an@GENE$ cytokine neutralization is a potential treatment for @DISEASE$ if antiviral therapy is not successful .	1
2214	Histological examination of the oviducts on day 4 pi indicated that in 2 / 7 of the animals , focal to multifocal @DISEASE$ and a diffuse mild infiltrate of heterophils and macrophages were present in the mucosa of the infundibulum and in the serosa of the magnum	1
2215	In one of these two animals , @DISEASE$ were also described	1
2216	On day 6 pi , in 3 / 7 birds , severe @DISEASE$ involving the full width of the tonaca mucosa , associated with @DISEASE$ and a @DISEASE$ were recorded at the level of the infundibulum ( Figure 5 ) , and in one of these subjects the lesions extended to the magnum and isthmus	1
2217	In the other two subjects , the magnum , isthmus and uterus appeared normal	1
2218	Ten days from challenge , 1 / 7 of the birds showed @DISEASE$ , mild @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ; in 4 / 7 of the birds a mild @DISEASE$ was observed , and in two of these birds , a similar picture was observed at the level of the magnum , while the isthmus and uterus appeared normal	1
2219	On day 18 pi , 3 / 7 of the birds had a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the mucosa of the infundibulum , with follicular organization , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
2220	The histopathology score assigned to the infundibulum , magnum and uterus indicates the infundibulum as the most affected section of the oviduct from 4 to 10 days pi ( Table 2 ) .	1
2221	Let aside the anatomical district of the oviduct , we detected the @GENE$ in organs beyond the digestive and respiratory tracts , namely in the kidney , spleen and brain of 25 % of the layers on day 4 pi , and in the kidneys and spleens of 50 % of the birds on day 6 pi .	1
2222	The importance of zoonotic emerging infections is increasingly recognized , as illustrated by outbreaks of @DISEASE$ and the ongoing threat of human infections with @DISEASE$ virus	1
2223	It is essential to understand transmission dynamics and risk factors for infection , in order to design effective strategies to contain and prevent the spread of @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
2224	@DISEASE$ is an emerging @DISEASE$ , which is increasingly reported in Asia	1
2225	It has become an important threat for human health , illustrated by the explosive outbreak in Sichuan Province China associated with at least 215 cases and 39 deaths in 2005 [ 2 ]	1
2226	In Vietnam , @DISEASE$ infection was first reported in 1996 and the number of human cases has increased annually	1
2227	In Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi , it causes approximately 40 % of all adult @DISEASE$ cases	1
2228	This is more than Streptococcus pneumoniae and @DISEASE$ combined [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .	1
2229	Partial network data constitute a well - known problem , and have been studied extensively in social sciences and other fields , such as epidemiology in humans and livestock diseases	1
2230	While the amount of data available to modellers is increasing , so too are privacy concerns	1
2231	In order to predict the risk of disease spread in humans across large spatial scales , detailed movement networks must be established	1
2232	These networks can be informed using commuting and migration data available from population censuses [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]	1
2233	These data capture long - term trends , but may not be appropriate at predicting movements over a shorter time scale , and therefore can be complemented by the inclusion of other information such as mobile phone data	1
2234	Mobile phone records track locations and times that individuals make and receive calls , and therefore can act as a proxy for shorter - scale movement patterns [ 23 , 26 ]	1
2235	While full access to these datasets is not readily available , previous work indicates that partial samples may be sufficient to accurately predict the risk associated with disease spread across these networks [ 24 , 27 ] .	1
2236	in the whole - lung data set would also be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium	1
2237	We performed sample correlation in the BXD data set and returned the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts ( Supplemental Material , Table S1 in File S2 ; P , 0	1
2238	0005 )	1
2239	This set of 100 transcripts was enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function , including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ )	1
2240	To define genes within this list that were likely to act in a concerted manner in the pulmonary myocardium , we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation	1
2241	0	1
2242	8	1
2243	These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed with lower stringency to visualize potential relationships between them ( Figure 1A )	1
2244	Three @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) were detected by two separate probes and thus the 24 transcripts corresponded to only 21 unique @GENE$	1
2245	All 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle ( Chopra and Knollmann 2013 ; Ding et al	1

2261	These genes can be loosely clustered into functional categories including @GENE$ , regulation of @GENE$ assembly , ion transport , transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation , and hormone signaling ( Table 1 ) .	1

2267	However , more examples of NO inhibition can be reported , for example the production of NO was also inhibited by the citrus peel waste essential oil in LPS - activated RAW 264	1

2271	A1 cells when treated with high concentrations of ( - ) - linalool	1
2272	The same was observed for the @GENE$ expression	1
2273	The same monoterpene inhibited NO release but did not inhibit the increase of @GENE$ expression indicating that the inhibitory activity of linalool was mainly attributed to the @GENE$ enzyme activity [ 142 ] .	1
2274	α - Humulene and trans - caryophyllene , the main constituents of Cordia verbenacea inhibited the LPS - induced @GENE$ activation and neutrophil migration in the rat paw , however unable to inhibit LPS - induced @GENE$ activation [ 113 ]	1
2275	The essential oils of diverse Pimpinella species and their isolates were able to inhibit @GENE$ transcription induced by phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) in SW1353 cells	1
2276	However , they did not present similar activities	1
2277	The most remarkable activity was reported for three Pimpinella species and five pure compounds : Pimpinella corymbosa Boiss	1

2284	These results also indicated the importance of a common structure ( epoxyphenylpropanoid moiety ) present in some of these pure compounds for the best anti - inflammatory activity .	1
2285	The reduction in @GENE$ cleavage by @GENE$ in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral @GENE$ activity , or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication , @GENE$ translation , and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity	1
2286	To directly measure viral @GENE$ activity in cells , we generated a proteasesensitive @GENE$ reporter system	1
2287	In this split @GENE$ system , cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly @GENE$ activity , which can be normalized to a @GENE$ transfection control	1
2288	This system has previously been used to explore the activity of @GENE$ [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion	1
2289	To generate this system , we	1
2290	The study used a non - probability purposive sampling method , since it involves selection of individuals for participation based on their knowledge of a phenomenon that is being studied	1
2291	It was believed that those participants would provide the researcher with the rich data needed to gain insight and discover new meaning in an area of study	1
2292	The inclusion criteria were all nurses with five years ' experience caring for @DISEASE$ patients since it was believed that they would provide information - rich data .	1
2293	The aim of the present study was to investigate long - term outcomes of the offspring in a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced maternal immune activation ( MIA ) model and the effect of maternal molecular hydrogen ( H 2 ) administration	1
2294	We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H 2 attenuates @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , including induced pro - inflammat@GENE$ activation , in the fetal brain	1
2295	Short - term memory , sociability and social novelty , and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y - maze , threechamber , and prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) tests , respectively , at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks	1
2296	The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis	1
2297	Offspring of the LPS - exposed dams showed deficits in short - term memory and social interaction , following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex	1
2298	Maternal H 2 administration markedly attenuated these @DISEASE$ - induced abnormalities	1
2299	Moreover , we evaluated the effect of H 2 on LPS - induced astrocytic activation , both in vivo and in vitro	1
2300	The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS - exposed offspring , but decreased in the offspring of H 2 - administered dams	1
2301	In primary cultured astrocytes , LPS - ind@GENE$  pro - inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H 2 administration	1
2302	Overall , these findings indicate that maternal H 2 administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA - induced @DISEASE$ of offspring later in life .	1

2311	In total , 389 nonduplicate articles were found	1
2312	After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria , 271 citations were considered potentially eligible for inclusion in this review .	1
2313	The phylogenetic tree was built based on alignment of the @GENE$ of the amplicons of HAdV and the relevant prototype sequences from GenBank	1
2314	Fig 1 and Table 3 show that HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most prevalent	1
2315	The strains isolated from Northern China were identified as HAdV - 3 ( n = 10 ) and HAdV - 7 ( n = 24 ) , belonging to HAdV - B ; HAdV - 1 ( n = 6 ) , HAdV - 2 ( n = 1 ) , HAdV - 5 ( n = 2 ) , HAdV - 6 ( n = 2 ) and HAdV - 57 ( n = 1 ) , belonging to HAdV - C ; and HAdV - 37 ( n = 1 ) , belonging to HAdV - D ( Table 4 )	1
2316	The genotypes of most HAdV isolates were identified by alignment to those prototypes from GenBank , with the exception of isolates KM377988 , KM377996 , KM378012 , KM378034 , and KM378038 , which formed a single separate cluster compared to prototypes HAdV - 2 and HAdV - 6	1
2317	HAdV - 37 and HAdV - 57 were also detected in respiratory specimens , which were reported as the pathogens of @DISEASE$ and gastrointestinal , respectively	1
2318	In contrast , HAdV - C was predominant among the strains from Eastern China with HAdV - 1 ( n = 5 ) , HAdV - 2 ( n = 8 ) , HAdV - 5 ( n = 6 ) , and HAdV - 6 ( n = 1 ) , whereas HAdV - B also contained several strains from Eastern China with HAdV - 3 ( n = 2 ) and HAdV - 7 ( n = 1 ) , and HAdV - 4 ( HAdV - E )	1
2319	Table 5 , which indicated that dominant types for single HAdV infection was HAdV - 7 ( 3 cases ) , HAdV - 1 ( 3 cases ) and HAdV - 2 ( 2 cases )	1
2320	Based on the analysis of clinical records , the clinical manifestation of the patients with HAdV infection included fever , cough , and sputum	1
2321	A few cases showed signs of a runny nose , nasal congestion , and gastrointestinal symptoms , such as diarrhoea and vomiting ( Table 5 )	1
2322	Because the prevalence of co - infection of HAdV with other viruses is higher than that of HAdV infection alone , it is difficult to associate the clinical profiles with HAdV infection or specific types .	1
2323	The @GENE$ Server currently supports 127 access functions	1
2324	These functions are listed on a web page generated automatically from the latest version of the code , ensuring that the documentation remains up to date	1
2325	A sample showing the web page description of ids _ to _ sequences is shown ( Fig	1

2327	Over the past few years , numerous viruses have been detected in bats and these viruses seldom cause any overt disease ( with the exception of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) [ 1 , 16 , 37 ]	1
2328	Detection of virus and absence of disease have led researchers to suggest that bats are likely the reservoirs of these viruses	1
2329	Asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( Middle Eastern @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) ) , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ]	1
2330	For a species to be a viral reservoir , the virus needs to persist in the population	1
2331	Two probable ways in which this can happen are ( 1 ) virus infection and clearing from infected individuals is an ongoing process and introduction of naïve individuals maintains the virus in the population and ( 2 ) individuals infected with the virus are able to maintain the virus in the form of a persistent infection	1
2332	Although either or both of these possibilities may influence the bat - virus relationship , there is considerable evidence for the maintenance of some viruses in bat populations by continued , low - level persistence .	1
2333	Although mounting evidence suggests that autophagy is unlikely to play a role in the replication of coronaviruses and the generation of coronavirus replicative structures , several questions remain unanswered	1
2334	Work performed so far focusses mainly of members of the betacoronaviruses , MHV and SARS - CoV	1
2335	Detailed characterisation of the membrane structures induced in cells infected with @DISEASE$ , like @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , or @DISEASE$ , like IBV , needs to be performed	1
2336	Although these viruses are related , it is possible that there are differences in the mechanisms of membrane rearrangement and the types of structures induced	1
2337	In addition , the location of RTC assembly and the site of viral RNA transcription and replication@GENE$ e identified	1
2338	The membranes induced in MHV and SARS - CoV infected cells are complex and how the different structures play a role in virus replication is currently unknown	1
2339	Furthermore , the mechanism by which these rearrangements are generated is not understood	1
2340	Whether MHV induced membranes are altered upon inhibition of ERAD tuning and which proteins might be involved in hijacking the pathway remains unknown	1
2341	Moreover , whether this pathway is important for the replication of other coronaviruses is also unknown .	1
2342	Different analytical techniques have been described for the qualitative and quantitative determination of alkaloids in both wild plant and in vitro culture of Amaryllidaceae including GC - MS [ 2 , 11 , 12 ] , spectrophotometric [ 2 ] , HPTLC [ 11 , 13 ] , and enzyme immunoassay [ 2 ]	1
2343	Few HPLC methods coupled with various detection methods were described for determination of lycorine in Amaryllidaceae plants such as Galanthus species [ 7 ] , Leucojum aestivum , and Pancratium 2	1
2344	Reis , Mandl , and others use time series methods to detect evidence of disease outbreaks at Boston Children ' s Hospital [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] , modeling specific clinical complaints as deterministic trend and seasonalities plus a stationary autoregressive moving average ( ARMA ) process	1
2345	They repeat this process for the visit counts instead of considering a joint modeling procedure	1
2346	The detection algorithm filters one - step - ahead prediction errors [ 5 ] , and looks for values in this residual process that exceed a predetermined threshold	1
2347	Their simulations are based on less realistic deterministic outbreak models	1
2348	Ivanov , et al	1
2349	[ 6 ] use the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average smoother to measure timeliness , sensitivity , and specificity of free - text chief complaints ( information describing patient ' s status on the ED visit )	1
2350	They indicate that the methods are good for detecting relatively large seasonal outbreaks , but not for small outbreaks	1
2351	Burkom , et al	1
2352	[ 7 ] extend this approach using Bayes Belief Networks to improve detection sensitivity and timeliness	1
2353	There are also a number of wavelet - based and smoothing - based methods that can be used to monitor and detect abnormalities of unknown form , occurring over different time scales [ 1 , 8 , 9 ]	1
2354	The use of scan statistics [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] has also gained popularity in recent years	1
2355	Many of the methods based on scan statistics use fixed - effect models for biosurveillance ( also see , e	1
2356	g	1
2357	, [ 13 ] and [ 14 ] for other methods based on fixed - effect models ) .	1
2358	Finally , participants in this study were asked to describe the most important strategies to combat @DISEASE$ and to raise awareness among the population	1
2359	The most often mentioned responses were : the need to project @DISEASE$ costs to draw more attention to the topic ; pushing forward the @DISEASE$ agenda by fear of no treatment ; creating a community of practice ; considering the social aspects of @DISEASE$ in order to develop prevention efforts against @DISEASE$ ; engaging the community and public campaigns on the drivers of @DISEASE$ ; and increasing vaccination rates in children and adult population	1
2360	One important step to realizing these strategies would be to have good quality data obtained from standardized surveillance platforms at the national level	1
2361	This will allow the conduct of outcome research , which can eventually be translated into messages to increase awareness and to push forward the @DISEASE$ agenda	1
2362	For example , Naylor et al	1
2363	used a national mandatory surveillance database in England to quantify the cost and mortality burden of @DISEASE$ , as well as the influence different resistances have on them	1
2364	Such findings will be useful for understanding the health and economic impact of future trends in resistance , and for prioritization of funding and strategies to tackle the problem [ 33 ]	1
2365	In addition , future research could focus on exploring further how the current Singapore National Strategic Action Plan is being implemented ; exploring in more detail the social , political , behavioral and cultural components affecting @DISEASE$ ; and analyzing at greater length what type of @DISEASE$ awareness campaigns could be developed to reach the community and engage civil society organizations .	1
2366	Inclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) patients aged $ 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of @DISEASE$ ( see below for definition ) , and ( 2 ) patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
2367	Exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) patients in whom the pathogen was not identified , ( 2 ) patients in whom BAL fluid analysis was impossible ( due to severe @DISEASE$ or clotting of specimen ) or not performed , ( 3 ) patients with a mixed infection ( identification of bacteria and virus ) , ( 4 ) patients who were treated with antimicrobial agents for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL , ( 5 ) patients with @DISEASE$ , ( 6 ) patients with @DISEASE$ , and ( 7 ) patients with @DISEASE$ .	1
2368	While neither CNS antiviral function nor @DISEASE$ were affected by Foxp@GENE$ eg@GENE$ etion , a potential increase in virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells may be unapparent due to their low frequencies in the CNS	1
2369	Specifically , SR CD4 + T cell frequencies are low within the CNS , although higher than in CLN ( 13 )	1
2370	To verify that their increased numbers in CLN do not lead to enhanced circulation and recruitment to the CNS , we used ELISPOT to determine frequencies of both virus - specific and SR T cells in the CNS	1
2371	Frequencies as well as total numbers of IFN @GENE$ eting M 133 - specific CD4 + T cells were indeed similar in the CNS of both groups ( Figure 5 )	1
2372	Contrasting the CLN , both frequencies and total numbers of IFN @GENE$ eting MOG 35 − 55 - and MBP 60 − 80 - specific CD4 + T cells were also identical within the CNS of DT - treated DTR − and DTR + mice ( Figure 5 )	1
2373	These data were consistent with similar @DISEASE$ and supported a limited role for Foxp3 + @GENE$ olling the CNS SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic @DISEASE$ .	1
2374	Adenoviruses are ubiquitous , non - enveloped , double - stranded DNA viruses [ 1 ]	1
2375	Human adenoviruses ( HAdVs ) are classified into 7 species ( Human mastadenovirus A to G ) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology , whole - genome sequencing , and phylogenetic analyses [ 1 ]	1
2376	The prevalence of different HAdV types varies among different geographical regions [ 2 ]	1
2377	HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [ 1 , 2 ] , including @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
2378	@DISEASE$ is prevalent in children , and is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population in developing countries [ 3 , 4 ]	1
2379	Numerous outbreaks of @DISEASE$ caused by HAdV have been reported during the last decade in many countries including China [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
2380	The HAdV types most commonly found in respiratory samples belong to HAdV - C ( HAdV - 1 , - 2 , - 5 , - 6 ) and HAdV - B ( HAdV - 3 , - 7 ) [ 2 , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] ; however , severe or even fatal disease outbreaks are predominantly caused by only a few types ( such as HAdV - 14 , - 21 and - 55 ) [ 2 , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
2381	The molecular typing by HAdV hexon sequences@GENE$ te the discrimination of types , resulting in timely epidemiological examinations and improved patient care [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
2382	Several studies have shown the association between severe @DISEASE$ in adult and HAdV species [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] ; however , reports among children with severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in China are limited .	1
2383	Of 36 @DISEASE$ patients with underlying @DISEASE$ , four ( 11	1
2384	1 % ) were too young ( < 6 months of age ) to have been immunized against influenza , and for two patients ( 5	1
2385	6 % ) , data on their influenza vaccination status was unavailable	1
2386	Twenty - nine ( 80	1
2387	6 % ) patients from this risk group had not been vaccinated against influenza although they would have been eligible	1
2388	One @DISEASE$ child ( 2	1
2389	8 % ) had been vaccinated in October 2012 , but was diagnosed with @DISEASE$ ( H3N2 ) in January 2013 .	1
2390	In the present study , the authors aimed to describe changes in serum protein levels in patients with @DISEASE$ induced by @DISEASE$ and patients with severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
2391	The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes , similar to α - feto@GENE$ fo@GENE$ ISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
2392	It was not possible in this study to obtain a series of serum samples from individual patients as they progressed through the various stages of @DISEASE$ to severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
2393	However , using iTRAQ and western blotting @GENE$ ral candidate proteins were identified ( namely apolipoprotein J precursor @GENE$ or@GENE$ er s@GENE$ y using a larger number of samples .	1
2394	Autophagy is a multistep process that consists of the isolation of @GENE$ into double - membrane vesicles , called autophagosomes , that shuttle to lysosomes , which serve as end - point degradative organelles	1
2395	It is a catabolic mechanism that enables the removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and proteins , thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and survival	1
2396	1 The autophagic machinery is highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans	1
2397	Among the proteins that take part in this process , the @GENE$ play a central role	1
2398	2 Indeed , these proteins are involved in the elongation and maturation of the autophagosome and its fusion with lysosomes	1
2399	1 , 3 @GENE$ reside on autophagosomal membranes where they can contribute to the recruitment of other core @GENE$ essential for the effective course of the autophagy process	1
2400	1 , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Although originally considered to be a nonselective bulk degradation mechanism , a gathering body of evidence over the past decade suggests that autophagy is much more selective than initially appreciated	1
2401	Selective targeting of cellular components to autophagosomes for degradation relies on the existence of @GENE$ able to recognize and tether cargos toward nascent autophagosomes	1
2402	8 , 9 Examples of selective autophagy include aggrephagy , mitophagy , lipophagy , and xenophagy	1
2403	[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ is essential for the proper steering of the cargo for degradation	1
2404	These receptors typically contain an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , also known as @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ ; the latter correspond to @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ respectively ) critical for the binding to @GENE$	1
2405	7 , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The @GENE$ consists of a short @GENE$ with a core motif originally described as W / F / Y / L / V ( where ' x ' represents any amino acids , and referred to as WxxL hereafter )	1
2406	7 , 18 This sequence has lately been relaxed and extended to 6 amino acids to integrate most of the experimentally verified LIRs	1
2407	[ ILV ] , where the residues in positions 3 and 6 correspond to the most crucial ones for the interaction with Atg8 - family proteins	1
2408	[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Besides its role in cellular homeostasis , autophagy is also involved in the innate immune response against pathogens	1
2409	13 , 29 , 30 Recent years have seen an outburst of studies on autophagy and viral infections	1
2410	Autophagy may exert a variety of antiviral functions , including the degradation of viral components ( known as virophagy ) , the activation of innate immunity by the delivery of viral nucleic acids to the Toll - like receptors , and adaptive immunity through the major histocompatibility complex II ( MCH - II / HLA class II ) , or the control of the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS )	1
2411	[ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] However , to be successful , viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host defense	1
2412	Several viruses have thus developed strategies to use the autophagy machinery or even thrive in the autophagosomes and promote their replication , spread , and survival	1
2413	[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Other viruses susceptible to autophagy have evolved mechanisms to counteract autophagy activation by expressing proteins that interfere with the cellular machinery , essentially inhibiting the autophagosome - lysosome fusion or interfering with early stages of autophagy activation	1
2414	[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] A few proteins from viruses infecting mammals and plants that interfere with the host autophagy process have been shown to associate with Atg8 - family proteins	1
2415	52 , [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Yet , only one LIRdependent interaction has been reported	1
2416	62 We have developed a database , iLIR @ viral ( http : / / ilir	1
2417	uk / virus / ) , that organizes information on the presence of LIR motifs in viral proteins	1
2418	Additionally , a curated text - mining analysis of the literature permitted us to predict functional LIR motifs in viral proteins that have already been shown to associate with Atg8 - family members .	1

2420	Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks , which is not always possible with sub - genomic sequences .	1
2421	To map more precisely this specific epitope within the @GENE$ , we concentrated on the overlapping 11 - mer peptide shared between peptides # 89 and # 90 and obtained nine 8 - 10 - mer peptides ( Table 1 )	1
2422	Using these peptides for the stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA - MERS - N vaccinated mice , we obtained the highest numbers of IFN - γ producing T cells with peptide 10	1

2426	Although ICR - and BALB / C - suckling mice were reported to be susceptible to genotype C of EV71 infection to induce neurological pathology using a mouse - adapted but not clinically isolated virus in these experiments [ 8 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] or using the natural strain of EV71 in @DISEASE$ newborn mice [ 6 ]	1
2427	The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches	1
2428	Previously , We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2 - transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates , the early syndrome of @DISEASE$ , followed by progressively neurological LP were developed	1
2429	In addition , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal @DISEASE$	1
2430	Despite the @DISEASE$ in the reported model that differ from the CNS - tropism of EV71 infection in humans , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice were characterized as bi - pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites [ 11 ] .	1
2431	Recently , we identified a novel , highly efficient − 2 / − 1 @GENE$ event that functions without a recognizable stimulatory RNA secondary structure ( 18 , 19 )	1
2432	This signal operates during translation of the genome of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales ( 20 )	1

2448	The second signal , which stimulates both − 2 PRF and − 1 PRF , is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large , multifunctional replicase subunit , non - structural protein 2 ( nsp2 )	1
2449	Here , about 20 % of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the − 2 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein ( nsp2TF ) comprising the N - terminal two - thirds of nsp2 and a C - terminus derived from a conserved , overlap - ping ORF ( transframe ; TF ) in the − 2 reading frame	1
2450	A further 7 % of ribosomes shift into the − 1 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N ( 19 )	1
2451	As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence ( GG GUU UUU ) used for − 2 / − 1 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA - structure - stimulated PRF	1

2455	A further novelty of the PRRSV − 2 / − 1 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25 - kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1 ␤ , which functions as a trans - activator of both − 2 and − 1 PRF ( Figure 1B ) ( 19 )	1
2456	Nsp1 ␤ is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins	1
2457	How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA - binding motif located in the papain - like autoproteinase ( PLP ) domain of nsp1 ␤ have a detrimental effect on frameshifting ( 19 ) .	1
2458	An alternative DNA amplification method was described by Notomi and coworkers [ 2 ] called ' loop mediated isothermal amplification ' ( LAMP )	1
2459	The LAMP assay relies on the design of a set of primers that generate @GENE$ ( hairpin ) structures during the early stage of DNA synthesis	1
2460	The hairpin structures form because two of the @GENE$ used contain , at their @GENE$ , a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site	1
2461	@GENE$ primers help the formation of these @GENE$ at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed , these structures can be copied into a series of @GENE$ containing multiple units of the target sequence under isothermal conditions utilizing the displacement properties of @GENE$ ( see [ 3 ] )	1
2462	Although LAMP was first described using a set of four @GENE$ , enhanced sensitivity was reported using an additional pair of @GENE$ [ 4 ]	1
2463	As the reactions are performed at a single temperature , LAMP assays can be performed very quickly since there are no separate denaturation , annealing and extension steps , and as such , reactions do not require thermalcyclers	1
2464	Here we assess the LAMP protocol for the detection of GMOs using primers that target event - specific sequences for transgenic MS8 and RF3 oilseed rape ( Brassica napus L	1
2465	) and generic @GENE$ such as the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and the promoter and @GENE$ for the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ , respectively ) from Agrobacterium spp .	1
2466	Housing factors , population density , parity segregated production and the feeding regimen after weaning play a role in the development of @DISEASE$ [ 38 ]	1
2467	It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail all the ideal conditions for pig housing during the post - weaning period , but to highlight the most important , as reviewed by Le Dividich and Herpin [ 39 ] , it is essential to provide the correct environmental temperature , 26 - 28 ° C , to maintain pigs in their thermo - neutral zone	1
2468	Chilling reduces intestinal peristaltic activity and consequently increases bacterial colonization , and low temperatures in weaner facilities appears to be responsible for a more severe course of @DISEASE$ [ 40 ]	1
2469	Also , it has been shown that automatic temperature control in the weaners housing reduces considerably the prevalence of @DISEASE$ [ 38 ]	1
2470	Wathes and Whittemore [ 41 ] reviewed several recommendations to prevent @DISEASE$ diseases by appropriate housing and environmental management	1
2471	These approaches involve avoiding drafts while removing moisture and gases using adequate ventilation	1
2472	Most often , flat decks are used instead of soiled bedding for weaned piglets ; however it was reported that this practice is accompanied by more @DISEASE$ among pigs [ 42 ]	1
2473	Moreover , the removal of manure and soiled bedding on a regular basis is also important to reduce the microbial load on farms .	1
2474	All of the Humboldt samples had an unusual sequence , ETGL , as the final four amino acids at the @GENE$ of @GENE$	1
2475	A recent study demonstrated that the last four amino acids in this region impact the virulence of the virus [ 27 ] ; if the final sequence is @GENE$ then the virus is attenuated due to induction of neuronal apoptosis	1
2476	According to this study , virulent , wild type RABV haplotypes have @GENE$ as the @GENE$ , and do not cause apoptosis of the host cell	1
2477	The impact of the @GENE$ haplotype on viral virulence is unclear , although it did not perceptibly impact virulence in skunks and foxes .	1
2478	In summary , our findings demonstrate that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through activations of @GENE$ - related signal and @GENE$ , which , in turn , increases activation and expression of @GENE$	1
2479	This suggests that @GENE$ and @GENE$ might play an important role in human bronchial epithelial cells thereby influencing their growth .	1
2480	Household exposure to pigs : breeding any number of pigs at home	1
2481	Characteristics of the participants @DISEASE$ occurred sporadically throughout the year without any clear seasonality ( Figure 3 )	1

2486	suis cases were predominantly male ( 82 % ) and from a rural residence ( 81 % ) with a median ( IQR ) age of 50 ( 41 - 59 ) years	1
2487	Twenty - one percent of cases had an occupation related to pigs , other exposure to pigs ( 46 % ) , or reported eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the two weeks prior to admission ( 48 % )	1
2488	Hospital and community controls were more frequently female and ( unmatched ) hospital controls were significantly younger , with a higher proportion of urban residence ( Table 3 )	1
2489	We further analyzed the age distribution of cases , hospital controls and @DISEASE$ patients amongst the hospital controls	1
2490	Nearly 70 % of @DISEASE$ patients were older than 45 years , while only 25 % of @DISEASE$ patients and 20 % of all hospital controls belonged to this age group ( Table 4 )	1
2491	The 49 hospital controls with @DISEASE$ ( not S	1

2495	During UV exposure , the 222 - nm lamps were placed 11 cm from the irradiation chamber window	1
2496	The lamps were directed at the 26 cm × 25	1
2497	6 cm chamber window which was constructed of 254 - µm thick UV transparent plastic film ( Topas 8007x10 , Topas Advanced Polymers , Florence , KY ) , and which had a transmission of ~ 65 % at 222 nm	1
2498	The wall of the irradiation chamber opposite the transparent window was constructed with polished aluminum in order to reflect a portion of the UVC light back through the exposure region , therefore increasing the overall exposure dose by having photons pass in both directions	1
2499	The depth of the irradiation chamber between the window and the aluminum panel was 6	1
2500	3 cm , creating a total exposure volume of 4	1
2501	2 L	1
2502	Flow of the aerosols continues out of the irradiation chamber to a set of three way valves that could be configured to either pass through a bypass channel ( used when no sampling was required ) , or a BioSampler ( SKC Inc , Eighty Four , PA ) used to collect the virus	1
2503	The BioSampler uses sonic flow impingement upon a liquid surface to collect aerosols when operated at an air flow of 12	1
2504	5 L / min	1
2505	Finally , flow continued out of the system through a final @GENE$ filter and to a vacuum pump ( WP6111560 , EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA )	1
2506	The vacuum pump at the end of the system powered flow through the irradiation chamber	1
2507	The flow rate through the system was governed by the BioSampler	1
2508	Given the flow rate and the total exposure volume of the irradiation chamber , 4	1
2509	2 L , a single aerosol droplet passed through the exposure volume in approximately 20 seconds .	1
2510	All interviews were transcribed verbatim and identifying data were removed from all research documents to ensure confidentiality	1
2511	QSR NVivo 11 software was used to organize and share the data among study team members	1
2512	We used an interpretive approach which focuses on the participants ' perceptions and interpretations of the topic of discussion	1
2513	Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify themes from the data	1
2514	We drew on techniques from the constant comparative method , such as line by line analysis , naming each line and segment of data , and the use of subsequent interviews to test preliminary assumptions	1
2515	In addition , deviant cases were explored and examined [ 20 , 21 ]	1
2516	The conduct of the interviews and coding occurred concurrently to enable the researchers to determine when theme saturation had been reached and to cease recruitment	1
2517	Thematic saturation was established when the research team discussed and agreed that no new themes were emerging from the data	1
2518	To improve the credibility of our findings , we conducted a member check at the final stage of manuscript preparation to validate our interpretation of the data and to ensure an accurate representation of participant perspectives	1
2519	We were unable to contact a few of the participants as they have moved on to another role and their contact information was not readily available	1

2521	Among the oxygen radicals , hydroxyl is the most reactive one , inducing severe damage to the adjunct biomolecules	1
2522	There are several ways to ascertain the ability to form hydroxyl radicals	1
2523	One of them is the deoxyribose test	1
2524	This method includes a mixture of ferric chloride ( FeCl 3 ) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , which in the presence of ascorbic acid forms Fe 2 + - EDTA , and oxidized form of ascorbic acid	1
2525	After addition of hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , Fe 3 + - EDTA and HO • are formed	1
2526	This is the so - called Fenton reaction , which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical ( Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2 → Fe 3 + + HO − + HO • )	1
2527	Hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments	1
2528	Some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH , originating a pink pigment that can be quantified by spectrophotometry [ 5 ]	1
2529	There are other methods that did not use deoxyribose but other components such as benzoic acid or safranine	1
2530	Using these methods several authors have evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of essential oils [ 51 , 53 , 54 , 57 , 83 , 84 ] .	1
2531	The proteasomal pathway plays an important role post - viral entry A previous report suggests the proteasomal pathway has a role during entry of @DISEASE$ into mammalian cells [ 25 ]	1
2532	To test this in the mosquito system , Hsu cells were pre - treated with MG132 at various concentrations ( 0	1
2533	1 , 1 and 10 μM ) , infected with @DISEASE$ ( MOI 10 ) at 4 ° C for 30 min and then incubated at 30 ° C	1
2534	Real - time RT -@GENE$ R using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 6 hpi showed no significant effect of MG132 treatment , indicati@GENE$  proteasome does not play a role during @DISEASE$ entry to Culex cells ( Fig 2C )	1
2535	To determine whether the proteasomal pathway plays significant role post - entry , cells were infected with @DISEASE$ and treated with 10 μM MG132 from 2 , 4 , or 6 hpi	1
2536	Real@GENE$  qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 48 hpi sho@GENE$  reduction in viral RNA in all treated samples ( Fig 2D )	1
2537	Experiments were also performed to rule out sign@GENE$ extracellular viral RNA in real time RT - qPCR results ( S2 Fig )	1
2538	These results suggest involvement of the proteasomal pathway post - viral entry , possibly during viral transcription .	1
2539	The antioxidant measurement by DPPH and FRAP methods showed that the essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllus exhibited higher activity than the volatile aglycone fraction obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis with @GENE$ from bitter almonds of the extract and further extraction from the aqueous layer with n - pentane [ 80 ]	1
2540	In the DPPH method , the antioxidant activity of clove oil was higher than the volatile aglycone fraction , although both samples have high eugenol content	1
2541	This lower activity could be attributed and according to the authors to the antagonism among other constituents present in small amounts in this fraction	1
2542	The reducing capacity of the essential oil was also higher than that of the volatile aglycone fraction	1
2543	Nevertheless in this assay the reference eugenol had weak ability , whereas in the DPPH method it possessed considerable activity	1
2544	Such a difference could be explained by the different polarity for FRAP method compared with DPPH method	1
2545	" Waterlike " solvents induce a dramatic decrease in the hydrogen atom - donating capability in comparison with ethyl alcohol used in DPPH method [ 80 ] .	1
2546	The presence of a significant increased @DISEASE$ in BAL - fluid of those patients in which NTHi was cultured , as compared to patients with a negative BAL - culture , supports the hypothesis that bacterial infection is indeed an inflammatory stimulus in children with persistent @DISEASE$ [ 24 ] .	1
2547	Research on antiviral CPP - PNA , - siRNA and - protein conjugates , although encouraging , is still at its infancy and importantly needs validation in animal models	1
2548	There is a need for improvement in the design of @GENE$ to tackle the issue of in vi vo toxicity and thereby make the drug conjugates safer	1
2549	As Stein highlights , even though @DISEASE$ dose regimens are shown to be nontoxic , it will be necessary to show that treatment with doses several times higher than the expected therapeutic dose is well tolerated [ 60 ]	1
2550	It is noteworthy that all@GENE$ @DISEASE$ studies were done in collaboration with a company specializing in RNAbased drugs , AVI BioPharma Inc , which first developed the PMO and provided the PPMO compounds	1
2551	O@GENE$ l the CPP - antiviral investigations , PPMO studies are the ones that are at the most advanced stage , with several reports of use in animal models and directed against a wide range of viruses	1
2552	Th@GENE$ k on PPMO illustrates the successful collaboration between academia and industry .	1
2553	Principal Findings : A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is @GENE$ , a @GENE$ strongly induced by @DISEASE$ infection	1
2554	Neutralizati@GENE$  IFNa in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro	1
2555	Since the primary sour@GENE$  IFNa in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ' s ) , we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation	1
2556	Depletion of pDC ' s in vivo eradicated both the LDV - in@GENE$  IFNa response and lymphocyte activation	1
2557	A primary receptor in pDC ' s for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV i@GENE$ eptor	1

2559	Interestingly , virus levels in@GENE$  TLR7 knockout mice and pDC - depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the sys@GENE$  IFNa response .	1
2560	The @GENE$ ] derived expression construct @GENE$ [ 43 ] , the @GENE$ - tropic derivative carrying the @GENE$ in @GENE$ [ 44 ] and the @GENE$ [ 30 ] , harboring a mutational inactivation of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 32 ] , have been previously described	1
2561	The @GENE$ encoding a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which had developed from the HIV - 1 HX10 isolate [ 45 ] , harboring @GENE$ or mutants thereof , in which the two amino acid motifs @GENE$ have been exchanged to AIVA , have been described elsewhere [ 26 , 46 , 47 ]	1
2562	The construct containing the ovalbumin - derived model epitope @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in its @GENE$ , @GENE$ , has been previously described [ 48 , 49 ]	1
2563	The @GENE$ for expression of @GENE$ ( HA - Ub ) was kindly provided by H	1
2564	- G	1
2565	Kräusslich and has been described elsewhere [ 30 ] .	1
2566	In order to assess the extent to which evolutionary analyses such as ours benefit from integrating host mobility data , we examine their predictive performance by using them to predict the relative timing of the geographic spread of the @DISEASE$ variant that emerged in 2009	1
2567	We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [ 31 ] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models , each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations ( Methods )	1
2568	We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient ( r ) and mean absolute error ( MAE ; in days ) ( Fig	1
2569	4 )	1
2570	An equal rates model ( A ) , which does not express any migration rate preference , results in a weak match ( r ~ 0 : 11 , P = 0	1
2571	73 , MAE = 40	1
2572	9 days ) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 ( Fig	1
2573	4 ) , indicating that the population sizes included in the SIR model for @GENE$ n offer limited predictive performance	1
2574	As expected , adding information on the number of airline passengers ( model B ) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations ( r ~ 0 : 61 , P = 0	1
2575	03 , MAE = 35	1
2576	8 days )	1
2577	In contrast , a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information ( model C ) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 47 , P = 0	1
2578	10 , MAE = 39	1
2579	4 days )	1
2580	However , if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters ( using BSSVS , [ 21 ] ; see Methods ) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance ( r ~ 0 : 62 , P = 0	1
2581	02 , MAE = 36	1
2582	4 days , Fig	1
2583	S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model ( B )	1
2584	Finally , The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor	1
2585	Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots	1
2586	The contribution of each predictor , when included in the model ( bDd ~ 1 ) , where b is the coefficient or effect size , is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale	1
2587	NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model	1
2588	We tested different population size and density measures , different incidence - based measures and different seasonal measures ( Text S1 ) , but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity	1
2589	The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub - sampled data set in Fig	1
2590	S5	1
2591	NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data	1

2596	g002 the GLM model ( D ) predicts the observed spread of H1N1 more accurately than all other models ( r ~ 0 : 82 , P , 0	1
2597	01 , MAE = 32	1
2598	3 ) , suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data	1
2599	The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion , while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality	1
2600	This is likely due to the multi - peaked character of the regional epidemics ( Text S1 ) ; the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave , whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely	1
2601	Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers , but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way	1
2602	Because of the outliers , we consider the non - parametric Spearman ' s r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE , but they are consistent in their model ranking	1
2603	We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September , 2009 , which returns a MAE of 11	1
2604	2 day for the GLM model	1
2605	However , because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks , and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model , we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here .	1

2609	Birds from negative control groups were selected as donors of tissues to study the binding preference of the challenge virus	1
2610	The virus histochemistry ( VHC ) technique was performed on the infundibulum , magnum , isthmus and uterus according to the protocol developed by van Riel et al	1
2611	[ 32 ]	1
2612	Briefly , 3 - µm sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with graded alcohols	1
2613	Incubation with the labelled virus was carried out overnight , at 4 ° C with either 5 , 50 or 100 @GENE$ units ( HAU )	1
2614	To visualize the bound virus , slides were incubated with a @GENE$ conjugated with @GENE$ targeting the FITC molecule labelling the virus	1
2615	The signal was amplified with a tyramide signal amplification system ( Perkin Elmer , MA , USA )	1
2616	@GENE$ was revealed with 3 - amino - 9 - ethyl - carbazole ( AEC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA )	1
2617	Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and embedded in glycerol .	1
2618	Briefly , oviduct swabs were aseptically collected from each bird and the site of sampling was the same in all oviducts , thus a sterile cotton swab was scrubbed for 5 s on the oviductal mucosa between the infundibulum and magnum portions	1
2619	Then , swabs were aseptically removed from the tissues and immediately put into an Amies transport medium for bacteria isolation ( Copan Innovation , Brescia , Italy ) , thus these biological specimens were sent to the laboratory for standard microbiology examinations	1
2620	Swabs were promptly inoculated into solid and liquid media for bacteria isolation such as Blood Agar plates , Mac Conckey plates , BEA plates ( Bile Esculin Agar ) and heart infusion broth ( HIB ) and cultivated at 37 ° C under 5 % CO 2 environment for 24 h	1
2621	After incubation , plates were checked for visible bacteria growth and in case of presence of colonies further standard bacteriological analyses were carried out for bacterial identification	1
2622	On the contrary , if no colonies were present on agar surface and the HIB broth presented turbidity , some drops of the broth cultures were inoculated in new and sterile Blood Agar , Mac Conckey and BEA plates , which were incubated in the same physical conditions for further 24 h	1
2623	Swabs for Mycoplasma spp	1

2625	synoviae was investigated through a Real Time PCR targeting the @GENE$ as described by Raviv and Kleven [ 28 ] with slight modifications	1
2626	The end - point PCR for M	1
2627	gallisepticum , targeting the @GENE$ , was performed as described by Garcia et al	1
2628	[ 29 ] with slight modifications .	1
2629	JY , X - fangY , and SH designed the experiments and wrote the paper , ZW and JY conducted the experiments , TZ and YW analyzed cell culture , FS , X - fengY and WZ prepared the virus , LX prepared the reagents .	1
2630	It often has a diffuse pattern and the epidermis may present @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 56 , 68 ]	1
2631	A nodular to diffuse arrangement of the @DISEASE$ is also reported [ 26 , 60 ]	1
2632	However , in a retrospective case series from Spain , two cats presented different histological findings [ 68 ]	1
2633	The first one had @DISEASE$ with a high number of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the @DISEASE$	1
2634	It was associated with a marked @DISEASE$	1
2635	The other cat was diagnosed with a @DISEASE$ typically represented by infiltration of lymphocytes , plasma cells and a few neutrophils and macrophages at the dermoepidermal junction	1
2636	In this case , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ were also observed	1
2637	A perivascular infiltration of superficial skin layers by macrophages , mast cells , neutrophils and eosinophils was also observed in another case [ 12 ] .	1
2638	Previous reports have demonstrated a causal relationship between prenatal exposure to LPS and deficits in social behavior and sensorimotor gating in offspring 38 , [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ]	1
2639	In this model , the social behavior including sociability and social novelty preference was impaired	1
2640	The number of oligodendrocytes in the amygdala , cerebral cortex , and white matter in the offspring was decreased , which is consistent with previous findings 47 ; and a reduced number of neurons in the amygdala and cortex was also observed	1
2641	Strong evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the amygdala in social processing and social cognition in humans [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] , as well as in social behavior in animals [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ]	1
2642	A recent report also suggested an association between the function of the cortex and the amygdala , and social behavior 54	1
2643	Therefore , the social behavior impairment observed in the present study is compatible with the neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex	1
2644	A locomotor test was not performed in this study , although we observed no apparent differences in speed of movement among all groups in the three - chamber social test	1
2645	Interestingly , there were no remarkable differences in the PPI test in our MIA model , and sensorimotor gating was also normal in comparison with the Control group	1
2646	A possible explanation for these results is that @DISEASE$ might occur following exposure to a pathogen at mid - gestation 55 , while impairments in short - term memory and social behavior might be independent of the timing of exposure to a pathogen 2	1
2647	Thus , the negative results of the PPI test might be due to the fact that in the present model , LPS exposure occurs at late gestation , on embryonic day 17 ( E17 )	1
2648	Impairments in short - term memory and social behavior are well described in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , 56	1
2649	@DISEASE$ manifest primarily in adults with @DISEASE$ , and are not observed in children with @DISEASE$	1
2650	A recent study further suggested that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain @DISEASE$ subgroups 59 , although it may be a globally common feature in @DISEASE$ 60	1
2651	Therefore , the present model may reflect @DISEASE$ - like rather than @DISEASE$ - like @DISEASE$ .	1
2652	Experimental @DISEASE$ 	1
2653	We combined the five genome sequences from Kenya and Zambia with available global sequences , aligned individual genes and calculated the percent nucleotide ( nt ) and amino acid ( aa ) identity ( Table 2 ) .	1
2654	The complexity involved in using traditional technologies and tools often proves to be over - whelming and counterproductive	1
2655	Most of these tools require an understanding of programming or scripting languages , such as Perl , Python , Java , and UNIX - scripts	1
2656	Recent examples of such systems in bioinformatics include Biopipe [ 15 ] , BioWBI [ 16 ] , Taverna [ 17 ] , Wildfire [ 18 ] , KDE Biosciences [ 19 ] , @GENE$ [ 20 ] , Biowep [ 21 ] , and BioWMS [ 22 ]	1
2657	Each deployment is therefore subject to its own code development and testing	1
2658	Although programming languages offer sophisticated control over the intended procedure , the learning curve and overheads in terms of human resources are difficult to justify	1
2659	Quascade has been developed with this problem in mind .	1
2660	For instance , Figure 9 shows a screenshot of the implemented sequential workflow for a distance based phylogenetic analysis .	1
2661	To identify the DEPs more comprehensively , we used two methods : An analysis of variance test that included a p - value < 0	1
2662	05 and at least one of the fold - change ratios between any time points passing the threshold was used to identify the DEPs of all groups ( Method 1 )	1
2663	Furthermore , to clarify the protein alterations of each time points , a two - tailed unpaired t test that included a p - value < 0	1
2664	05 and a fold - change ratio between a given time point and the mock ( 114 ) passing the threshold was used for screening the @GENE$ at the different time points ( Method 2 ) .	1
2665	Astrovirus VA1 identified by next - generation sequencing in a nasopharyngeal specimen of a febrile Tanzanian child with @DISEASE$ of unknown etiology	1
2666	As expected , a large amount of proteomic data was generated in this study	1
2667	Venn diagramming functional annotation , hierarchical clustering , and pathway enrichment were utilised to analyse the results	1
2668	A common analysis strategy in proteomics is to look for a period in which the changes in the protein expression were the most prominent	1
2669	However , such a strategy is dissociated from the status of viral infection and the impact on the infected cells	1
2670	A different strategy in this study was employed that combined the detected significant changes in @GENE$ with viral replication and @GENE$	1
2671	In view of the @GENE$ and the one - step growth curve shown in Fig	1
2672	1b , the viral titre was increased quickly during the first 12 hpi	1
2673	In addition , the @GENE$ involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly enriched by up to 6	1
2674	74 % of the total @GENE$ at 12 hpi ( Fig	1
2675	3 )	1
2676	Since the cells had efficient proliferation at 12 hpi , this time point was suitable for studying the @GENE$ involved in autonomous parvovirus replication .	1
2677	Lymphocyte levels were analyzed retrospectively when available	1
2678	Initially after admission , lymphocyte levels were not different between the groups ( control alive 8	1
2679	3 % ± 3	1
2680	4 ; control dead 8	1
2681	9 % ± 4	1
2682	5 ; IVIG alive 8	1
2683	9 % ± 4	1
2684	4 ; IVIG dead 7	1
2685	3 % ± 5	1
2686	7 )	1
2687	However , lymphocyte levels were higher in survivors compared to those in non - survivors ( Fig	1
2688	2 )	1
2689	The increase in lymphocytes was more prominent in survivors compared to that in non - survivors ( control alive 1	1
2690	74 ± 0	1
2691	85 ; IVIG alive 3	1
2692	16 ± 5	1
2693	03 ; control dead 0	1

2695	17 ; IVIG dead 2	1
2696	13 ± 1	1
2697	55 ; Fig	1
2698	3 )	1
2699	In addition , in patients treated with IVIG , this increase during treatment was more prominent than that in the control group in the first 28 days ( Fig	1
2700	3 )	1
2701	Since we did not evaluate differential blood counts routinely , limited data were available for determining significant difference .	1
2702	All data , including age , sex , smoking history , comorbid conditions , symptoms and clinical signs , initial laboratory and radiological findings , culture results , @DISEASE$ severity index , clinical course , length of hospital stay , and survival outcome were collected from electronic medical records	1
2703	We evaluated etiologies by sputum , nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions , blood , and urine using a microbiological culturing approach	1
2704	Respiratory specimens were typically obtained from selfextracting sputum	1
2705	When sputum specimens could not be obtained , upper respiratory tract specimens , such as oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs were used for viral PCR tests	1
2706	Multiplex real - time PCR was performed using a Real - Q RV Detection kit ( BioSewoom , Seoul , Korea ) with a Roche Light Cycler 480 II instrument ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany )	1
2707	Respiratory viruses included in this test are as follows ; adenovirus , rhinovirus , influenza virus A / B , @DISEASE$ A / B , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , coronavirus , and parainfluenza virus 1 / 2 / 3	1
2708	All patients were given chest X - rays and / or high resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) at the time of our emergency department visit .	1
2709	Background : Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency	1
2710	While direct measurement of beat frequency from high - speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming	1
2711	The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video ( AVI ) files that runs on open - source software ( ImageJ ) coupled to Microsoft Excel , and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high - speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia	1
2712	These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz .	1
2713	A thousand networks were created for each sampling scheme	1
2714	Of these , 100 were randomly selected for simulations	1
2715	Statistics are averaged over 1000 simulations that had a final epidemic size of at least 10 farms	1
2716	Pseudo - code for the @GENE$ process is included in electronic supplementary material , algorithm 1 .	1
2717	In order for models to be used to predict the potential for disease spread in livestock , there is reliance upon accurate data regarding farm locations and movements of livestock between farms	1
2718	Significant work has been done in the UK to predict the potential for disease spread through the livestock network [ 12 , 17 , 18 ] owing to the existence of the @DISEASE$ and the animal movement licence scheme	1
2719	In many other countries around the world , the lack of such databases means that it is impossible to develop a model that uses precise movement data , and an alternative approach must be used	1
2720	In such countries , it may be impossible to ever record all movement data either owing to the sheer size of the industry ( in countries such as the USA ) or owing to the cost associated with implementing an animal licence scheme	1
2721	However , a more limited data collection scheme may be possible , whereby movements are recorded for a subset of the livestock movement network .	1
2722	One hundred ninety - one patients ( 31 % ) had a previous history of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ and 54 of them ( 28 % ) were using an asthma controller therapy	1
2723	Most had a mild exacerbation ( = 110 ; 57 % ) and 69 ( 36 % ) moderate , while only 12 ( 6 % ) presented a severe @DISEASE$	1
2724	Sixteen percent of them required admission either to the short - stay observation or to the Pediatric Ward	1
2725	Among the children with a previous @DISEASE$ diagnosis , 95 ( 49 % ) were ≥ 6 years and 63 of them ( 67 % ) were not using any controller therapy ( either for no prescription or for no use )	1
2726	The severity of the exacerbations in patients who are ≥ 6 years with a previous diagnosis of @DISEASE$ and divided into two subgroups ( controller therapy , no controller therapy ) is shown in Figure 3 : @DISEASE$ patients not using a controller medication were more likely to have a moderate - to - severe exacerbation than their peers under long - term therapy ( <	1
2727	01 ) .	1
2728	According to the findings of this study , nurses experience stress , frustration , and pain due to the conditions of @DISEASE$ patients and they perceive their job as one of the hardest since it deals with emotions	1
2729	Nurses always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives	1
2730	When they fail , they always feel bad and become emotionally frustrated	1
2731	This study shows that , there is a high death rate in the @DISEASE$ wards of Tshilidzini Hospital , and when a patient dies , nurses feel sad and hurt	1
2732	The findings of this study agree with those of the study by Khalid et al	1
2733	[ 27 ] , which showed that participants also experienced a variety of emotions when nursing patients with @DISEASE$ , and not knowing what they were facing .	1
2734	@DISEASE$ is transmitted through airborne routes	1
2735	Poorly designed or overcrowded healthcare facilities play an important role in @DISEASE$ transmission and also increases the chances of cross - infection between patients and healthcare workers	1
2736	HCWs are essential in the fight against @DISEASE$ infection and they should be protected	1
2737	A good ventilated working environment should have natural , mechanical , and negative pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of spreading @DISEASE$ in the wards	1
2738	Natural ventilation relies on open doors and windows to bring fresh air in the wards from outside , which dilutes the concentration of particles such as droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis .	1
2739	Cutaneous samples showed a greater RQ of @GENE$ than other tissues	1
2740	Arm skin had the highest RQ of @GENE$ ( RQ mean = 1937 ± 3692 CI , n = 7 ) , and digit skin was the second most intensely infected area ( RQ mean = 24 ± 24 CI , n = 4 ) ( Fig	1
2741	3a )	1
2742	Of all cutaneous swabs taken , arm swabs yielded the most @GENE$ ( RQ mean = 29 ± 47 CI , n = 6 )	1
2743	It appears virus is present over much of the body with all cutaneous swabs and tissue showing 100 % SQPV presence in infected individuals	1
2744	In contrast to grey squirrels , non - cutaneous samples also showed high infection rates in red squirrels but with somewhat lower infection intensities when compared to cutaneous samples ( Fig	1
2745	3b )	1
2746	For example , blood showed the highest RQ of the non - cutaneous tissues tested ( RQ mean = 0	1
2747	097 ± 0	1
2748	16 CI , n = 7 ) , while rectal swabs provided the highest recovery of @GENE$ ( RQ mean = 0	1
2749	23 ± 0	1
2750	33 CI , n = 7 ) ; indeed , the recovery of SQPV from rectum was comparable to the relative quantity of @GENE$ found in faeces ( RQ mean = 0	1
2751	18 ± 0	1
2752	22 CI , n = 5 ) .	1
2753	The linear accumulation of mutations during the 2009 outbreak clearly also extends to the longer - term accumulation of mutations during the entire history of H1N1 ( Figure 2 )	1
2754	During the last century there has been a remarkably constant increase in mutation count within the H1N1 virus population , except for a striking discontinuity between 1957 and 1976	1
2755	This discontinuity reflects the extinction of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s , followed by the re - introduction of the strain in 1976 , presumably from a researcher ' s freezer	1
2756	Even though most reports ( e	1
2757	g	1
2758	, [ 53 ] ) indicate the re - introduction year was 1977 , our data suggests the year of re - introduction was 1976	1
2759	This is based upon the isolate A / New Jersey / 1976 , which very clearly falls in line with the rest of the re - introduced lineage	1
2760	Notice that after re - introduction in 1976 , the human @GENE$ mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the extinction occurred in the 1950s .	1
2761	Genetic analyses of Thai CaKoVs showed that whole genome of 4 Thai CaKoVs posed highest nucleotide similarity to Chinese CaKoVs including SMCD - 59 and CH - 1	1
2762	This observation supported phylogenetic analysis that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 97	1

2765	Of all @GENE$ genes , the @GENE$ was the most diverse gene among Thai CaKoVs and other reference CaKoVs	1
2766	Similar observation was also reported in previous study that @GENE$ is the most variable @GENE$ [ 24 ]	1
2767	It is noted that the putative @GENE$ at @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was observed both in Thai CaKoVs and reference viruses	1
2768	Previous studies indicated that @GENE$ may associate with enteric receptor binding of the viruses [ 14 , 24 ]	1
2769	It is noted that Thai CaKoVs posed unique @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) , which also observed most reference viruses from China , Korea , Japan , US , UK suggesting unique characteristic	1
2770	These unique amino acids were not observed in the CaKoV from the Australia ( CE9 ) , Brazil ( BRA / 26 ) and Tanzania ( TZ / 75 , TZ82 ) [ 16 , 20 ]	1
2771	However , the association of these unique amino acids and viral pathogenesis is still need to be further investigated	1
2772	Based on genetic analysis , unique amino acids at the position , 65 V , 67D , 119L , 138 T , 150P , 151M , 153D , 201S , 204Q , 205Q , 201Q , 213 T and 241E were observed	1
2773	These unique amino acids of China / Thailand sub - cluster could be benefit for the detection of virus origin or diagnostic purpose in the future	1
2774	Similar to previous study , analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of @GENE$ were conserved among CaKoVs except one variation at 776 / 777 ( VP3 / VP1 ) which unique in wild carnivores [ 16 ] .	1
2775	Coxsackievirus B3 Responds to Polyamine Depletion via Enhancement of 2A and 3C Protease Activity	1
2776	The natural route of transmission among reservoir rodents is thought to be principally through aerosols and / or biting [ 27 ]	1
2777	However , experiments have been equivocal in clarifying transmission mechanisms	1
2778	Weanling bank voles caged with infected individuals lead to transmission as early as 14 days post exposure [ 14 ]	1
2779	Similar experiments examining @DISEASE$ transmission between deer mice have been less informative ; however , in artificial enclosure experiments , transmission appeared to be facilitated by deer mice with higher amounts of viremia and wounding [ 8 ] and males likely play a dominant role in transmission in natural populations [ 9 , 28 , 29 ]	1
2780	In bank voles , offspring of @DISEASE$ - infected dams were less likely to be infected after exiting the nest because of @GENE$ l antibody [ 30 ]	1
2781	Although it is thought horizontal transmission is most important , work by Hutchinson et al	1
2782	[ 31 ] showed that vertical transmission occurred among cotton rats ( Sigmodon hispidus ) infected with @DISEASE$ , so it is possible that both routes may influence transmission at the population level .	1
2783	In conclusion , our results together with existing data in the literature indicate that @GENE$ interfere with HIV - 1 replication at two steps of the viral life cycle ; in target cells by retaining incoming particles into endosomes and in virus - producing cells , by leading to the production of virions of decreased infectivity	1
2784	This dual mechanism of inhibition may be similarly exerted against other viruses	1

2799	Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is a positive single - stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornavirudae family	1
2800	EV71 together with Coxsackievirus 16 ( CVA16 ) , CVA5 , and CVA10 , are known to be major causative agents that cause mild @DISEASE$ symptoms called @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in infants and children [ 1 ]	1
2801	Since 1997 a significant increase of EV71 epidemics has been observed throughout the Asian - Pacific region [ 2 ]	1
2802	In the 1998 EV71 outbreak in Taiwan , over 100 000 young children were infected , and approximately 400 children were hospitalized with severe @DISEASE$ that resulted in 78 deaths [ 3 , 4 ] .	1
2803	@GENE$ antagonism limits local restimulation of antiviral CD8 + T cells during @DISEASE$ 	1
2804	Background : Time series methods are commonly used to detect disease outbreak signatures ( e	1

2806	, signals due to @DISEASE$ outbreaks and @DISEASE$ ) from varying respiratory - related diagnostic or syndromic data sources	1
2807	Typically this involves two components : ( i ) Using time series methods to model the baseline background distribution ( the time series process that is assumed to contain no outbreak signatures ) , ( ii ) Detecting outbreak signatures using filter - based time series methods .	1
2808	At least five @GENE$ have evolved under recurrent positive selection Motivated by our hypothesis that ADP - ribosylation may be an important PTM in host - virus conflicts , and our prior use of	1
2809	A novel strategy to efficiently overcome the impermeable cell barrier came from the surprising findings in the late 1980s that certain naturally occurring short peptide sequences have the ability to enter cells when added to culture media	1
2810	The @GENE$ peptide , derived from @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 20 , 21 ] , and penetratin , derived from @GENE$ [ 22 ] , were the first cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) to be described	1
2811	@GENE$ and penetratin have paved the way to the discovery of other naturally occurring CPPs such as the herpesvirus tegument protein @GENE$ [ 23 , 24 ] or the cell wall protein - derived peptide inv3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [ 25 , 26 ]	1
2812	Chimaeric CPPs such as transportan ( a chimera of the neuropeptide galanin and the wasp venom toxin mastoparan ) [ 27 ] and totally synthetic CPPs such as the model amphipathic peptide ( MAP ) [ 28 ] or arginine oligomers [ 29 ] have also been designed and are routinely used	1
2813	The exact mechanism of cellular uptake is not clear and studies remain controversial	1
2814	Current models include uptake through transient pore formation , caveolae , clathrindependent endocytosis , and macropinocytosis	1
2815	Recent data suggest endocytosis as the prevailing model for uptake , although several mechanisms may coexist and differ depending on CPPs [ 30 , 31 ] .	1
2816	Plasmids containing each event were constructed to test the specificity of the @GENE$ and @GENE$ assays separately	1
2817	The junction at the right borders of the @GENE$ were amplified by PCR from the @GENE$ sample using the displacement ( outer ) primers of the @GENE$ reactions , MS8 - RF3 DisplR ( @GENE$ separately with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , to amplify the @GENE$ , respectively ( see Figure 1 and Table 1 )	1
2818	The fragments were cloned into @GENE$ ( Promega , Southampton , UK ) and transformed into @GENE$	1
2819	Clones containing the correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing .	1
2820	Crops and intestines dissected from flies ' bodies at various times after virus exposure were used for virus isolation and titration	1
2821	Virus was isolated from fly crops and intestines up to 24 h after exposure and from feces and vomit matter of 1 of 3 blow flies at 48 h after exposure ( Table 1 )	1
2822	Our results suggest that the ant M	1
2823	rubra can be an alternative host for both DWV A and B as a result of foodborne transmission because of the presence of both high viral titers and the @GENE$ for up to 13 weeks after the last virus - infected food has been consumed	1
2824	These results further support that DWV has a wide host range including other predatory insects [ 14 , 15 , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] 37 ]	1
2825	Interestingly , there were only two ant species from the family Formicidae among the more than 60 species in which DWV has been detected so far [ 21 ]	1
2826	It is obvious that recently consumed highly virus infected food like honeybee pupae , containing the @GENE$ , might lead to false positive results simply because of the presence of viral particles in ant ' s gut	1
2827	Because of the delayed sampling , we can however expect that the gut content of the ants has been cleared out at least once before the virus analyses [ 55 ] .	1

2832	And believe it or not , infection , the scourge of infection wasn ' t one of the top five	1
2833	" - I02 , Human Health	1
2834	Focusing on shared threats that lead to both bat population declines and disease emergence will allow for a common research agenda and can serve to bring together bat conservationists and @DISEASE$ experts	1
2835	While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step , assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host - virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts , such as humans or domestic animals , is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives	1
2836	Host - virus dynamics are complex , and the emergence and spread of bat - associated viruses requires more than just the presence of a pathogen in a reservoir host but detailed knowledge of a host species ' ecology , behavior , reproduction , genetics , and life history traits [ 18 , 82 ]	1
2837	Evidence suggests that many @DISEASE$ have a long history of co - evolution with their bat hosts [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] , further highlighting the importance of understanding both phylogenetic factors and environmental contact with other species to fully appreciate factors driving cross - species transmission [ 34 , 86 ]	1
2838	Outbreaks of @DISEASE$ associated viruses are commonly attributed to atypical interactions between bats and other wildlife species , domestic animals , and humans resulting from human - driven land - use change and encroachment	1
2839	Shared threats to public health and wildlife conservation transcend national borders , and minimizing such threats will require transboundary collaborations among diverse experts	1
2840	One multidisciplinary consortium , the Bat One Health Research Network ( BOHRN ) , is now addressing these important issues at a global scale by connecting bat experts and public health researchers to identify critical gaps in research [ 87 ] .	1
2841	In addition to the change of mean weekly vomiting episodes within treatment groups , it was also of interest to consider the number of cats that reached resolution , or no @DISEASE$ episodes , over the weekly period	1
2842	The probability of vomiting declined during the course of the study , with a significant decline in cats fed Diet A in weeks 2 - 4 , with a 0	1
2843	2 probability in the final week	1
2844	Sixty seven percent ( n = 8 ) of the cats fed Diet A and 47 % ( n = 7 ) of the cats fed Diet B had no @DISEASE$ episodes at the final week of the study	1
2845	Of these 15 cats , 3 showed an episodic pattern over the 4 - week period , with 1 or more weeks without vomiting followed by a later week with @DISEASE$ .	1
2846	Serum collected from all participants was screened for the presence of @GENE$ using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs )	1
2847	One sample with borderline results and five samples with negative ELISA results were retested using indirect immunofluorescence The @GENE$ was performed as previously described	1
2848	5 The number of plaques per well were counted ; reductions in plaque counts of 50 % ( PRNT50 ) and 90 % ( PRNT90 ) were calculated using the Spearman - Kärber formula	1
2849	5	1
2850	@DISEASE$ is one of the most common vaccine - preventable @DISEASE$ , with the highest morbidity reported for children and elderly patients [ 1 , 2 ]	1
2851	@DISEASE$ during childhood usually present as mild @DISEASE$ , but severe complications and fatalities also occur , especially in children less than 2 years of age and in children with underlying chronic conditions [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]	1
2852	However , 40 - 50 % of @DISEASE$ - associated fatalities occur in previously healthy children [ 4 , 8 ] .	1
2853	Methods : From July 2004 to June 2007 , we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates ( NPA ) from 2 , 230 cases of @DISEASE$ ( World Health Organization criteria ) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur , Nepal	1
2854	The specimens were examined for @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , @DISEASE$ type A ( InfA ) and B ( InfB ) , @DISEASE$ types 1 , 2 and 3 ( PIV1 , PIV2 , and PIV3 ) , and human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase c@GENE$ assay .	1
2855	Using the @GENE$ , we next sought to create true inhibitors of @DISEASE$ that were not cleavable substrates and with the potential proteolytic stability required for in vivo studies	1
2856	Addition of N - terminal capping groups to the peptides completely abrogated any inhibitory ability	1
2857	Next , the peptides were cyclized through the formation of a disulfide bond using N and C - terminal cysteine residues ( Cys - XHSPW - Cys = cyc - XHSPW )	1
2858	The cyclization of the parent nHSPW peptide through cysteine residues ( cyc - nHSPW ) also eliminated any measureable inhibition of @DISEASE$ ; however , cyclization of the leucine derivative ( cyc - LHSPW ) yielded an inhibitor with a K i of 24	1
2859	7 μM	1
2860	Truncation of the core sequence revealed the im@GENE$ nce @GENE$ o4 and Trp5 in determining the affinity of the cyclic peptide , resulting in K i values of 121	1
2861	4 μM and > 500 μM for the cyclic tetrapeptide and tripeptide derivatives , respectively .	1
2862	We excluded 11 cases from the analysis due to inhibition of the PCR	1
2863	Out of the remaining 2 , 219 @DISEASE$ cases , Infection with more than one virus was identified in 29 ( 3	1
2864	3 % ) of the 887 positive specimens	1
2865	The most common double infection was PIV3 in combination with hMPV , which was found in nine cases	1
2866	We identified three viruses in one case ( PIV1 , PIV2 , RSV ) and four viruses in another ( PIV1 , PIV2 , InfB , RSV ) .	1
2867	As derived from the correlation analyses ( r s = 0	1
2868	68 ) , up to 46 % of the monthly variation in occurrence of @DISEASE$ in our study could be explained by meteorological factors	1
2869	However , the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear	1
2870	Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival , transmission efficiency , and host immunity , or have an indirect effect through climatedependent behavior change , such as indoor crowding and eating habits [ 55 ]	1
2871	We detected more than one virus in 3	1
2872	3 % of the virus - positive NPA specimens , which is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study [ 56 ] , but lower compared with studies using molecular methods detecting a wider array of viruses [ 57 , 58 ]	1
2873	The frequency of viral co - detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [ 59 ] and the number of pathogens tested for [ 58 ]	1
2874	By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses , a study in 515 Korean children aged ≤ 5 years detected viruses in 312 ( 60	1
2875	6 % ) of cases and a viral co - detection in 36 ( 11	1
2876	5 % ) [ 45 ]	1
2877	In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study , the Korean study also detected adenovirus , coronavirus , rhinovirus , and bocavirus ; and , notably , the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co - detections	1
2878	The clinical role of bocavirus in @DISEASE$ in otherwise healthy children is unclear [ 60 , 61 ] , as is the importance of multiple viral infections [ 57 , 59 ]	1
2879	Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co - detections [ 61 ] , as could case - control studies .	1
2880	These hypothetical source controls were defined to approach maximum technically feasible reductions	1
2881	The radon estimate assumes efficient application and control of radon safe construction in radon - prone areas combined with control of second hand smoke exposures known to act synergistically with radon	1
2882	Efficient second hand smoke reductions have already been demonstrated in Finland in both workplaces and in homes resulting a decrease in proportion of adolescents exposed to @DISEASE$ from 17 % in 1991 to 6 % in 2009 [ 25 ] and the @DISEASE$ policies are moving forward also on at European level	1
2883	The carbon monoxide controls were aimed to be implemented by compulsory alarms that will allow for identification of malfunctioning devices before the risks occur .	1
2884	Overall in EU - 26 , over 50 % of the total annual burden of disease associated with indoor exposures ( 4000 DALYs / million ) is estimated to be caused by PM 2	1
2885	5 originating from outdoor air , followed by particles from indoor sources , and radon ( Figure 3 ) .	1
2886	Live yeast : Saccharomyces cerevisiae HP healthy pigs , CP challenged pigs , NA not available a , b Values within a row with different superscripts differ significantly at P < 0	1
2887	05 c @DISEASE$ occurrence was calculated as the proportion of days in which pigs showed clinical signs of @DISEASE$ d Number of pig days with @DISEASE$ score ≥ 2 e Jejunum f log ( copies / g ) some alternatives have shown comparable efficacy to antimicrobials or colistin in the control of @DISEASE$ , there is still a considerable gap between these alternatives and antibiotics concerning their effectiveness in @DISEASE$ control	1
2888	Control of housing conditions and vaccination are the most promising strategies for the prevention of @DISEASE$ in pigs and for reducing of the overall use of antimicrobials on farms	1
2889	However , the establishment and the effectiveness of these strategies depend on the involvement of all stakeholders in pig farming	1
2890	Judicious use of antimicrobials in pigs and continued development of alternatives to antimicrobials and colistin remains a priority to ensure a long - term sustainable development in pigs .	1
2891	Turner et al	1
2892	also chose to enhance the cellular delivery and biological activity of @GENE$ by covalently attaching them to @GENE$ [ 95 ]	1
2893	They raised the more technical but nonetheless very important question of how the type of @GENE$ and the way it is linked to the @GENE$ affects the ability of the @GENE$ to reach its cellular target	1
2894	They conjugated the @GENE$ to the @GENE$ either via a stable polyether linker or through a cleavable disulfide bond and tested a range of @GENE$	1
2895	They could inhibit @GENE$ - dependent trans - activation in HeLa cells with disulfide - linked conjugates of @GENE$ to transportan or to the chimeric peptide R 6 - penetratin ( R = L - arginine )	1
2896	However , unlike what was reported by Tripathi et a l	1
2897	[ 93 ] , they found that @GENE$ and @GENE$ conjugates failed to inhibit transcription	1
2898	None of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans - activation inhibition	1
2899	Interestingly , supplementation of cell medium with the lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine enhanced inhibitory activity of disulfide - linked conjugates and stablylinked conjugates gained some inhibitory activity	1
2900	Supported by confocal microscopy data on cell localization of conjugates , the authors argued that endosomal release is a limiting factor in conjugates efficiency : following cell uptake , @GENE$ - PNA conjugates would be entrapped in endosomal or other membrane - bound cytosolic compartments and some of them would then be slowly released	1
2901	Endosomal entrapment was also reported with PPMO conjugates [ 79 ]	1
2902	However , this observation differs from Chaubey et al	1
2903	conclusion of the conjugates not being taken up by the endocytic pathway as uptake was not affected by low temperature or phenylarsine oxide [ 92 ]	1
2904	Turner et al	1
2905	attempted to improve not only the cell delivery but also the endosomal release properties of @GENE$ to increase @GENE$ antiviral activity [ 95 ] .	1
2906	The use of CPPs to deliver @GENE$ into cells has rather been limited to date , even more so for @GENE$	1
2907	Järver et al	1
2908	suggested that @GENE$ could be less amenable to CPP delivery due to charge interactions between the peptide and the @GENE$ and inefficient endosomal escape of the conjugates [ 30 ]	1
2909	To our knowledge , the only report of CPP - mediated delivery of @GENE$ is from Meng et al	1
2910	who constructed a cell - permeable siRNA targeting @GENE$ 102 ]	1
2911	The si@GENE$ s crosslinked at its 3 @GENE$ th the tat peptide	1
2912	The authors reported the cellular uptake and antiviral effect of the CP@GENE$  being as efficient as transfection with lipofectamine in Huh - 7 cell culture	1
2913	However , some cell types being refractory to lipofectamine transfection which can moreover be toxic in vivo , CPP - mediated delivery of si@GENE$  definitely worth investigating in other cell types and in animal models of @DISEASE$ .	1
2914	To investigate the prevalence , epidemiology , and genotype of HAdV among children with @DISEASE$ in China .	1
2915	A plaque reduction neutraliszation test ( PRNT ) assay was performed on pooled day 35 sera from mice immunised with either the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ or a @GENE$	1
2916	The PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$	1
2917	16 As shown in Figure 3e , ZIKV - prME vaccina@GENE$ yielded significant neutralisation response with anti - ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilu@GENE$ titres ( inverse of the serum dilution at which 50 % of the control @DISEASE$ infection was inhibited ) of 456 ± 5 , whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV - Cap DNA vaccine immunized mice was 33 ± 6 which was minimally higher than that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals ( titre = 15 ± 2 ) .	1
2918	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , one of the most abundant @GENE$ , constitutes 1 % to 4 % of the total soluble proteins in actively dividing cells [ 16 , 17 ]	1
2919	The canonical function of @GENE$ is to bind aminoacyl - tRNA ( @GENE$ ) in a GTP - dependent manner and deliver it to the @GENE$ on the ribosome during protein synthesis [ 18 ]	1
2920	@GENE$ is also involved in non - canonical functions including turnover of @GENE$ , nuclear export events , binding and bundling of the actin cytoskeleton , apoptosis and the viral life cycle [ 19 , 20 ]	1
2921	@GENE$ contains three well - defined domains : the @GENE$ binds to GTP ; the @GENE$ binds to the @GENE$ of @GENE$ , the @GENE$ bind to the @GENE$ , and the @GENE$ is linked to @GENE$ binding [ 19 ] .	1
2922	In the present study , we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments that characterize immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of a CpG - A molecule in the domestic cat	1
2923	We show that ODN 2216 , the first described CpG - A [ 12 ] , can upregulate the expression of a series of genes in feline immune cells that play important roles in early responses to viruses	1
2924	Soluble molecules produced by feline PBMCs upon ODN 2216 stimulation significantly increased resistance of various feline target cell lines to propagation of viruses from five different families , namely FCV , FPV , FHV , FCoV and FeLV	1
2925	The observed repression of viral replication highly correlated with the mRNA expression of @GENE$ in stimulated PBMCs as well as the induction , prior to inoculation , of antiviral mechanisms in the target cells	1
2926	Furthermore , a single administration of ODN 2216 significantly increased the expression of @GENE$ in the blood of treated cats	1
2927	Plasma from these animals could also inhibit replication of FCV in vitro	1
2928	Our data underline the prophylactic potential of ODN 2216 in an outbred species as a stand - alone agent and against a large range of viral pathogens simultaneously	1
2929	Cats may highly benefit from such a molecule when placed in environments with strong infectious pressure such as catteries , shelters or pet shows .	1
2930	In the direct competition methods , natural antioxidants compete for the peroxyl radical with a reference free radical scavenger	1
2931	Examples of reference free radicals scavengers include the fluorescent natural protein @GENE$ and the natural crocin , or fluorescein , which compete with the antioxidant sample for peroxyl radicals formed	1
2932	These radicals may be produced through the addition of AAPH or AMVA	1
2933	This is the principle of the so - called ORAC ( oxygen radical absorbance capacity ) protocol	1
2934	Another example is the bleaching of β - carotene during the autoxidation of linoleic acid or in a controlled chain reaction by using a free radical initiator : AAPH [ 29 ] .	1
2935	In order to determine whether a discrepancy in expression of @GENE$ between the PBMCs of adult animals and kittens could play a role in these observations , mRNA levels of this gene were measured in immune cells of each cat	1
2936	Although basal @GENE$ expression was similar in the PBMCs of the cats of all age groups ( Figure 2F ) , ODN 2216 stimulation increased @GENE$ transcription in the cells of kittens , but decreased transcription of this gene in the cells of adult cats so that differences in the mRNA levels of this receptor were significantly higher in young cats ( group 1 ) than in adult cats of groups 2 and 3 ( p = 0	1
2937	0286 ) ( Figure 2G ) .	1
2938	The frequent upper respiratory tract colonisation with these aerobic bacteria in children , may provide difficulties to discriminate between contamination and true @DISEASE$ [ 25 ]	1
2939	However , we consider our results to reflect true @DISEASE$ , as we applied procedural methods , which were shown to limit strongly the risk for contamination [ 13 , 20 , 26 , 27 ]	1
2940	In particular , we chose to use a cut - off of ≥ 10 4 cfu / ml for bacterial BAL - culture , although in adults a cut - off of ≥ 10 3 cfu / ml has demonstrated to be discriminative [ 28 , 29 ]	1
2941	The applied cut - off was also used previously by others , studying children with @DISEASE$ [ 30 ]	1
2942	Moreover , although FOB + BAL were only performed once in the majority of patients , our results probably reflect @DISEASE$ as all our samples were collected during stable clinical state .	1
2943	Amomum tsao - ko oil with low antioxidant activity measured through the TBARS method [ 70 ] , as reported above , also had weak ability for scavenging DPPH free radicals and low ferric reducing power , mainly due to the low phenolic content of the oils [ 56 ] .	1
2944	The ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals of the essential oils of Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus were evaluated using the safranine method and the authors reported that the latter oil was more effective than the former	1
2945	The activity of both oils were dose - dependent and they were mainly constituted by thymol , p - cymene and γ - terpinene [ 54 ]	1
2946	Patil et al	1
2947	( 2010 ) [ 51 ] have compared two methods ( deoxyribose and benzoic acid ) on the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of Ageratum conyzoides , mainly constituted by the phenolic chromenes precocene I and precocene II , and they obtained different responses according to the method used	1
2948	In the benzoic acid hydroxylation method , the essential oil presented better activity than in the deoxyribose method	1
2949	The authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid .	1
2950	Amongst the differentially expressed genes in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , @GENE$ was highly up - regulated ( > 20 - fold in RNA - Seq and > 12 - fold in real - time RT - qPCR ) following @DISEASE$ infection in Culex cells ( Fig 1B and S2 Tabl@GENE$ 10574 is orthologo@GENE$ lin4@GENE$ in 4B ( ~ 70 % amino acid identity with bot@GENE$ 3 Fig ) and is therefore referred to he@GENE$ xC@GENE$ gases , su@GENE$ lin4A , have been found to be upregulated during @DISEASE$ infection of mammalian cells and implicated in various cellular processes such cell cycle regulation , signal transduction , DNA replication as well as viral replication [ 33 ]	1
2951	Initially , in vivo va@GENE$ f RNA - Seq analysis was performed using a mosquito infection model	1
2952	Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with @DISEASE$ ( NY99 - 4132 strain ) by blood - feeding	1
2953	Total RNA was collected from whole carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi	1
2954	Real - time RT - qPC@GENE$ rmed using CxCul4 - specific primers showed approximately 4 - and 12 - @GENE$ increases in mRNA in carcass and midgut , respectively , compared with control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood ( Fig 3A ) .	1
2955	Participants could refuse any of these options , as well as any questions posed to them during the interview itself	1
2956	All participants were de - identified to maintain confidentiality .	1
2957	After combining the humidity control inputs with the aerosolized virus , input flow was directed through a series of baffles that promoted droplet drying and mixing to produce an even particle distribution and stable humidity 34	1
2958	The RH and temperature inside the irradiation chamber were monitored using an Omega RH32 meter ( Omega Engineering Inc	1
2959	, Stamford , CT ) immediately following the baffles	1
2960	A Hal Technologies HAL - HPC300 particle sizer ( Fontana , CA ) was adjoined to the irradiation chamber to allow for sampling of particle sizes throughout operation .	1
2961	HeLa SS6 , HeLa TZM - bl , and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % ( v / v ) inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / mL penicillin , and 100 µg / mL streptomycin	1
2962	HeLa - K b cells were cultivated in DMEM with additional 1 mg / mL geneticin	1
2963	All cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Gibco ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA )	1

2965	Confluent monolayers of HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol	1
2966	Twenty - four hours post transfection cells were lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8	1

2970	@GENE$ should not only promote the cellular uptake of the cargo but also improve its intracellular trafficking to ensure that it reaches the appropriate cellular compartment	1
2971	This aspect cannot be overlooked when designing antivirals as different viruses may carry their replication cycles in different subcellular locations such as the cytosol , the nucleus or in an intricate membrane system within the cytosol	1
2972	The type of linkage between the @GENE$ and the antiviral compound is of importance as for instance a disulphide bond would result in the rapid release of the cargo through the action of cytoplasm glutathione	1
2973	Therefore the choice of @GENE$ should not only be optimized to the cargo but should also be specific to the virus to ensure that the antiviral molecule efficiently reaches its viral target in the subcellular compartment .	1
2974	Specific @GENE$ ( MAPK ) cascades control the activation of @GENE$ and their @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) are known as the @GENE$	1
2975	These " @GENE$ dimerize to form the @GENE$ , a converging point that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , transformation , inflammation , pulmonary defense , and autoregulation of @GENE$ transcription [ 46 ]	1
2976	Early studies [ 47 , 48 ] suggested that @GENE$ had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ because it was highly expressed in 31 - 50 % of patients with @DISEASE$ , and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium	1
2977	One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant - negative c - Jun mutant TAM67 in lung e@GENE$ ial cells decreased @DISEASE$ number and overall @DISEASE$ burden in chemically induced mouse @DISEASE$ models [ 49 ]	1
2978	c - Jun is an@GENE$ nt transcriptional activator of PDK1	1
2979	Notabl@GENE$ xpression of PDK1 is suffi@GENE$  to restore @DISEASE$ growth after c - Jun k@GENE$  in @DISEASE$ cells , suggesting that PDK1 is @GENE$ portant mediator of c - Jun @GENE$ c activities [ 50 ]	1
2980	Consistent with this , we found that PGE 2 increased the expression of c - Jun @GENE$ enous overexpression of c - Jun @GENE$  bronchial epithelial cells proliferation and expression of PDK1 , w@GENE$ s inhibition by PDK1 inh@GENE$ r or siRNA caused inhibitions of cell growth and expression of PDK1	1

2982	Induction of c - Jun @GENE$  regulates the expression and activation of PDK1 and@GENE$  growth	1
2983	It indicated c - Jun @GENE$ ay an important role in the potential mechanism of abnormal cell proliferation in brochial epithelial cells .	1
2984	intra - host viral populations in such an event	1
2985	Importantly , the @DISEASE$ outbreak samples collected by the CDPH were accompanied by epidemiologically important documentation such as exact date and location for most of the samples	1
2986	Additionally the CDPH ' s ongoing surveillance efforts provided a unique repository of samples for previous @DISEASE$ host jumping events , which failed to be efficiently transmitted within the gray fox population	1
2987	Next generation sequencing technology has recently been used to examine viral heterogenei@GENE$  genomes present in infected tissues but has not yet been optimized for detection of rare genotypes ( less than 1 % ) [ 26 ]	1
2988	Deep genome sequencing of these recent and past samples allowed us to define the viral mutational dynamics that were associated with a @DISEASE$ virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes , suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species	1
2989	Historically , the @DISEASE$ virus variant present in Humboldt Co	1
2990	has been detected in foxes more frequently than in any other region of the state but not until 2009 has transmission shifted so disproportionally to the fox population [ 11 ]	1
2991	Our data indicate that the outbreak haplotype responsible is able to be transmitted readily by both skunks and foxes since no genetic changes viral sequence differentiated the skunks and the foxes from the epizootic	1
2992	These results are similar to those from a study describing the genetic changes associated with the Arizona CST events in that the @DISEASE$ genotype from the donor species ( bats ) could not be differentiated from that found in the recipient species ( skunks or foxes ) [ 8 ] .	1
2993	A contradiction was found in the scientific literature concerning the impact of herd size on the prevalence of @DISEASE$ in pigs	1
2994	Indeed , Laine and collaborators reported that in Finland , the increase in pig ' s herd size was associated with a higher risk of @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 38 ]	1
2995	While , in Canada , Amezuca et al	1
2996	[ 43 ] reported that @DISEASE$ occurred on a variety of farm types and sizes	1
2997	However , a link between stocking density and @DISEASE$ was described in pig ' s farms in some countries [ 30 , 44 ]	1
2998	Mixing piglets from different farms is a common practice in pig husbandry , particularly at weaning	1
2999	This mixing can result in fighting as the pigs strive to establish dominance relationships , with most aggressive interactions being typically shown during the first few hours after grouping [ 45 ]	1
3000	It has been reported that the hierarchical behaviour among pigs leads to very significant differences in food and water consumption on farms [ 46 ]	1
3001	Production based on segregated sow parities was proposed as a solution to reduce the impact of the social hierarchy	1
3002	This system of grouping according to the sow ' s farrowing rank reduces disease challenge by reducing variation in the immune status of the piglets [ 47 ] .	1
3003	Maternal H 2 administration restored offspring growth	1
3004	We investigated postnatal growth , which could be related to neurologic outcome	1
3005	From postnatal day ( P ) 6 to P10 , offspring growth was significantly retarded in the @DISEASE$ group than in the Control group ( p < 0	1
3006	05 )	1
3007	Although significant differences were not observed between the LPS and LPS + HW group , maternal administration of Hydrogen water ( HW ) restored offspring growth to the control level ( Fig	1
3008	1 ) .	1

3012	Recurrent and / or persistent @DISEASE$ in young children is a major reason for use of pediatric healthcare resources [ 1 , 2 ]	1
3013	Despite the high morbidity of @DISEASE$ , there are only few comprehensive studies in this domain , resulting in poor knowledge of the pathophysiology and a lack of efficacy data of therapeutical interventions [ 3 ]	1
3014	Although 3 @DISEASE$ phenotypes have been described , in daily practice @DISEASE$ remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the pediatrician [ 4 , 5 ] .	1
3015	@GENE$ is another protein that commonly features in studies on @DISEASE$	1
3016	It is a mult@GENE$ uced by hepatocytes that is detectable in plasma and the extracellular matrix	1
3017	Glycosylation of VN m@GENE$ lates multimerization and coll@GENE$ ing in liver regeneration ( 20 ) and alterations in VN g@GENE$ osylation modulate substrate adhesion to rat hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , which is responsible for matrix restructuring ( 21 )	1
3018	Immunoblotting data identified increases in VN l@GENE$ ls in @DISEASE$ , and VN immunore@GENE$ ivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix , irrespective of the apparent reduction in plasma VN .@GENE$ re@GENE$ ivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of @DISEASE$ , particularly for @DISEASE$ , paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa ( 22 )	1
3019	These results suggest that VN may be important in the@GENE$ ogression of @DISEASE$ and / or in @DISEASE$ through its collagen - binding domain I , and tha@GENE$  higher in @GENE$ ients with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ than in controls ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 )	1
3020	In the present study , VN levels decreased in the progression of @DISEASE$ ( @GENE$ m @DISEASE$ to HBV - induced @DISEASE$ )	1
3021	The observation of decreased VN levels was consistent with two other studi@GENE$ ( 24 , 25 )	1
3022	In one of these studies , it was demonstrated that , in @DISEASE$ , the concentration of plasma VN was significantly lower than in healthy controls and w@GENE$ associated with the severity of @DISEASE$	1
3023	Notably , levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patien@GENE$ with @DISEASE$ compared with those in normal controls	1
3024	These results suggested that VN was deposited in injured tissue during the repair process and function@GENE$ as an adhesive protein ( 24 )	1
3025	In the other study , it was demonstrated that t@GENE$ evels of plasma VN in @DISEASE$ , which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis @GENE$ on in injured tissues or a combination of the two ( 25 )	1
3026	The same group of authors also revealed that decreased levels of plasma VN and fi ( FN ) and increased levels of serum laminin ( LM ) P1 in patients with chr@GENE$ c liver diseases were associated with hepatic dysfunction , and that changes in the levels of the glycoproteins involved in cell attachment were significant in the development of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases ( 25 )	1
3027	Based on the accumulating information on VN and liver fibrosis , it appears that VN requires further study .	1
3028	The @GENE$ technique relies on the design of an interrelated set of @GENE$	1
3029	The orientation and positions are important for self - priming through @GENE$ that drive and perpetuate the reaction .	1
3030	In addition to the two genotypes of EV71 , we also examined whether N3 could protect hSCARB2 - transgenic mice from @DISEASE$ ) infection	1
3031	One dose of early N3 administration after CVA16 infection significantly prolonged survival but did not rescue the mice from developing @DISEASE$ which eventually led to death ( Fig	1
3032	S1 )	1
3033	This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross - neutralization of N3 against CVA16 ( Fig	1
3034	S2 ) .@GENE$ deed , N3 was able to recognize CVA16 @GENE$ ions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA ( for@GENE$ ïve protein interaction ; Fig	1
3035	S3 ) and Western blot ( for denatured protein interaction ; Fig	1
3036	S4 )	1
3037	In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains , N3 showed lower affinity to naï@GENE$ CVA16 ( Fig	1
3038	S3 )	1
3039	Oppositely , anti - CVA16 antisera , obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16 , equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig	1
3040	S4	1
3041	N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins @GENE$ both B4 and C2 @GENE$ ximately 35 kDa [ 17 , 21 ] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 5@GENE$ a [ 22 ] that is different from anti - CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among b@GENE$ A16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa .@GENE$ 	1
3042	Central to almost all examples of − 1 @GENE$ is the interaction of the ribosome with a @GENE$ ( a @GENE$ or @GENE$ ) which promotes frameshifting on a stretch of homopolymeric bases known as the @GENE$	1
3043	How these @GENE$ act is incompletely understood , but accumulating evidence supports the view that by presenting an unusual topology ( 1 , 2 , ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) they confound an intrinsic unwinding activity of the ribosome with consequent effects on the elongation cycle and frame maintenance ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 )	1
3044	Indeed , kinetic analyses in bacterial systems indicate that @GENE$ can impair movements of the @GENE$ , delaying dissociation of @GENE$ and the release of @GENE$ from the @GENE$ ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) .	1
3045	The availability of appropriate MERS - CoV - specific immune monitoring tools is a prerequisite for the successful development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches	1
3046	The development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant @GENE$ antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the @DISEASE$	1
3047	Recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic @DISEASE$ in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of @DISEASE$ [ 52 , 53 ]	1
3048	Since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of @DISEASE$ are often associated with low levels of seropositivity , the analysis of MERS - CoV - specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention	1
3049	Moreover , in order to characterize the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ , it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus - specific T cells in animal models of @DISEASE$ and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these T cell responses .	1

3053	Increased T cell numbers and activation within CLN after @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion , but no differences in the CNS , implicated impaired T cell trafficking	1

3058	Similarly , CXCR3@GENE$ ssion on CD4 + T cells was upregulated in CLN ( Figure 6C )	1
3059	By contrast , there were no differences in CCL2 @GENE$ CL5 mRNA expression ( Figure 6B ) , indicating a preferential increase of IFN -@GENE$ ated chemo@GENE$ , 38 )	1
3060	These results supported the notion that enhanced and / or prolonged interaction of CXCR3@GENE$ d expressing APC with CXCR3 + T cells may promote retention , thereby limiting T cell egress into circulation ( 39 )	1
3061	Overall , these results indicate that Foxp3@GENE$ te suppressive function primarily within CLN and are more potent at controlling peripheral SR T cell activation than virus - specific T cells during @DISEASE$	1
3062	reduced Tr1 cell response correlates with increased cns sr T cells Unaltered SR T cell responses within the CNS of DT - treated DTR + mice indicated a Foxp3 - independen@GENE$ onent regulating the CNS autoimmune response during @DISEASE$	1
3063	In addition to Foxp3 + Tregs , IL - 10 - produ@GENE$  also regulate autoimmune responses , including during @DISEASE$ ( 40 , 41 )	1
3064	Tr1 cells are drastically reduced in JHMV - infected mice deficient in IL - 27 signaling , a cytokine promoting Tr1 cell response ( 15 )	1
3065	Analysis of IL - 27R − / − mice further demonstrated that IL - 27 does not play a pro - inflammatory role or significantly alter CD8 T cell function during JHMV infection but is rather a major regulator of the Tr1 response ( 15 )	1
3066	Myelin - specific CD4 + T cell responses were therefore compared in infected WT and IL - 27R − / − mice at d30 p	1

3068	, the peak of the SR T cell response ( 13 )	1
3069	Opposing the results in Foxp3 + Treg depleted mice , frequencies and numbers of both virus - and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells were similar within CLN of IL - 27R − / − mice compared to controls ( Figure 7A )	1
3070	Furthermore , frequencies of both virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells were significantly increased within the CNS of IL - 27R − / − mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 7B )	1
3071	Interestingly , alteration of CD4 + T cell frequencies in the absence of Tr1 cells was more prominent for myelin - specific compared to virus - specific T cells ( fivefold versus twofold , respectively ) , indicating preferential action on SR T cells	1
3072	Moreover , despite similar overall inflammatory cell numbers , numbers of virus and SR CD4 + T cells were increased in the absence of Tr1 cells ( Figure 7B )	1
3073	Tr1 cells thus do not appear to regulate peripheral SR CD4 + T cell responses but act preferentially within the CNS during chronic JHMV infection	1
3074	These data indicate that regulation of SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection is dependent upon Tr1 cells within the CNS , contrasting the specific role of Foxp3 + Tregs within CLN .	1
3075	@DISEASE$ was defined as the presence of an @DISEASE$ on a chest radiograph and at least one of the following : @DISEASE$ ( temperature $ 38	1
3076	0uC ) or @DISEASE$ ( temperature , 35	1
3077	0uC ) , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and altered breath sounds on auscultation [ 15 ]	1
3078	@DISEASE$ was categorized as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , or @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , as defined previously [ 16 , 17 ] .	1
3079	To our knowledge , this is one of the first studies to explore the social , political , behavioral , and cultural aspects influencing @DISEASE$ in a well - resourced setting	1
3080	A key strength of this study is that we were able to gather the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the human , animal , and environmental sector	1
3081	However , we had difficulty in recruiting participants from the environmental sector , and we were only able to interview two participants	1
3082	A limitation of this study is that participants could have downplayed some of the challenges and some strategies that are considered key to address @DISEASE$ could have been missed	1
3083	For example , the fact that Singapore has a well - functioning system for dispensing antibiotics in the human sector , with antibiotics only available with a physician ' s prescription , was not mentioned as often as a facilitator as one might expect	1
3084	This could be the case because it was already taken for granted as it has been in existence for several years .	1
3085	Underlying @DISEASE$ were reported for a total of 36 @DISEASE$ PICU patients ( 76	1
3086	6 % ) ( Table 3 )	1
3087	@DISEASE$ were most frequent ( 34	1
3088	0 % ) , followed by @DISEASE$ ( 25	1
3089	5 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 21	1
3090	3 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 17	1
3091	0 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 10	1
3092	6 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 8	1
3093	5 % ) , and @DISEASE$ ( 8	1
3094	5 % ) .	1
3095	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotype ( sequencing of the @GENE$ after polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] screening ) of HAdVs among children with @DISEASE$ in different areas of China from 2007 to 2010	1
3096	HAdV infections are often associated with the co - infection of bacterial or viral agents [ 21 ] , frequently leading to severe clinical consequences in hospital patients	1
3097	Thus , co - infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV was also investigated .	1
3098	Our manuscript is organized as follows : we start by summarizing the data of interest , and propose a statistical model for the ED data in each city	1
3099	Using the growing lit - erature on the subject , we outline a stochastic model for an @DISEASE$ outbreak along with a healthcare utilization model for simulating people entering the ED	1
3100	We then describe the methodology and theory for detecting unexpected outbreak signatures in time series sources using filters	1
3101	We examine the form and function of the filters used for detection	1
3102	In the results section , we explore the time series models obtained for each Midwest ED included in our study	1
3103	We assess these detection methods using a simulated @DISEASE$ attack , and we end with a discussion .	1
3104	Lycorine , a pyrrolophenanthridine alkaloid , is one the major alkaloids found in H	1
3105	littoralis [ 2 , 7 ]	1
3106	It displays strong antiviral effect against @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ [ 8 ]	1
3107	Besides , lycorine also possesses potent antiretroviral [ 9 ] , antimitotic [ 10 , 11 ] , and cytotoxic activities [ 2 , 12 ] .	1
3108	Recently the replication of IBV has been shown to induce autophagy in mammalian cells [ 55 ]	1
3109	Furthermore , individual expression of IBV @GENE$ , as well as @GENE$ from other viruses in the Nidovirales order , has been shown to induce autophagy [ 55 ]	1
3110	However , the mechanism by which this induction occurs is unknown	1
3111	Whether @GENE$ is responsible for inducing autophagy in the context of whole virus would also be interesting to discover	1
3112	In addition , as IBV is restricted to avian species , would similar observations be made in a more natural host model ? Finally , several studies have shown that coronavirus infection induces autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 , 55 ]	1
3113	However , the pathway does not appear to be required for virus replication [ 52 , 53 , 55 , 56 ]	1
3114	Therefore , is autophagy acting as a cellular defence to virus infection and does the virus have mechanisms to control this response ?	1
3115	The unique features of bats , whereby they tolerate @DISEASE$ without excessive inflammation while suppressing viral replication , leads to the obvious question : What is so special about bats ? The answer to this has been linked to the evolution of the ability to fly	1
3116	The increased rate of metabolism accompanying flight would lead to higher levels of oxygen - free radicals [ 32 , 33 ]	1
3117	This makes bats more prone to generating damaged DNA [ 34 ]	1
3118	As mounting an immune response is energetically expensive [ 35 ] and would be detrimental , bats probably evolved mechanisms to suppress activation of immune response due to damaged DNA generated via flight , thereby leading to reduced inflammation	1
3119	This would also explain why bats of certain species live longer than expected given their high metabolism and small size [ 36 ]	1
3120	In bats the evolutionary suppression of inflammation and consequent susceptibility to @DISEASE$ infection is counteracted by constitutive expression of inn@GENE$ nov@GENE$ target viruses as described earlier	1
3121	This model has been depicted in in Figure 1	1
3122	Development of flight necessitated the evolution of bats with the ability to modulate the consequences of increased metabolic activity by suppressing inflammation ( left )	1
3123	Inflammation was suppressed by dampening the activation of DNA@GENE$ uch as STI@GENE$ nd reducing levels of inf@GENE$ uch as TNF@GENE$ enter )	1
3124	These traits were positively selected but a reduced inflammatory response made it advantageous for virus replication ( lower right )	1
3125	Increased susceptibility of cells to virus replication was compensated by selection of more effective antiviral measures , such as higher constitutive expression of Int@GENE$ unique ISG@GENE$ ressions ( upper right )	1

3129	Human enterovirus 68 ( EV - D68 ) is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe @DISEASE$ and is associated with cases of @DISEASE$ , especially among children	1
3130	It was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( Schieble et al	1
3131	, 1967 )	1
3132	Over the past 10 years , @DISEASE$ infection outbreaks have been reported in Italy , the United States , Germany , China , and several other countries ( Esposito et al	1
3133	, 2015 ; Farrell et al	1
3134	, 2015 ; Reiche et al	1
3135	, 2015 ; Zhang et al	1
3136	, 2015 ) , with a record number of confirmed cases in 2014 ( http : / / www	1
3137	cdc	1
3138	gov / non - polio - enterovirus / about / ev - d68	1
3139	html )	1
3140	Unfortunately , no vaccines for prevention or medicines for treatment are currently available for future outbreaks , mainly due to the fact that information on host factors @GENE$ EV - D68 replication is scarce	1
3141	EV - D68 belong to @DISEASE$ ( family Picornaviridae , genus Enterovirus ) , which are non - enveloped , positive - sense singlestrand RNA viruses of approximately 7500 nt and contain a large open reading fr@GENE$ polyprotein tha@GENE$  to yield corresponding viral proteins @GENE$ molecular and biological characteristics , four human enterovirus ( HEV ) species are currently designated as HEV - A , - B , - C , and - D ( Oberste et al	1
3142	, 1999a , b )	1
3143	The representative of HEV - A serotype is human enterovirus 71 ( EV - A71 ) , which is a primary causative agent for @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) that is associated with the recent outbreaks in Asia ( Liu et al	1
3144	, 2011 ; Wang et al	1
3145	, 2012 )	1
3146	EV - D68 is assigned to HEV - D serotype , but EV - D68 is unlike other @DISEASE$ in that it is acid labile and biologically more similar to human rhinoviruses that are associated with @DISEASE$ ( Smura et al	1
3147	, 2010 ) .	1
3148	Among the seven recognised HAdV species ( HAdV - A to G ) , HAdV - B ( particularly HAdV - 3 , HAdV - 7 , HAdV - 11 , HAdV - 14 , HAdV - 21 ) and E ( HAdV - 4 ) have more often been associated with epidemic @DISEASE$ [ 4 - 6 , 12 - 15 , 19 ]	1
3149	Rapid detection of these viruses would enhance the outbreak response	1
3150	We reported the prevalence of multiple HAdV types ( HAdV - B , HAdV - C , HAdV - D HAdV - E ) in paediatric patients with @DISEASE$ in China from 2007 to 2010 ( overlapping the H1N1 pandemic period )	1
3151	Consistent with previous reports [ 6 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] , the HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most common serotypes for @DISEASE$ , and co - infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent ( 64 from 76 , especially co - infection with RSV , HRV , HBoV and PIV3 )	1
3152	And 32 from 76 were co - infected by two or more viruses	1
3153	The previous studies on co - infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV were limited	1
3154	Our data showed the higher number of co - infection might be resulted from samples ( from the severe paediatric patients ) and method ( molecular detection for multiple viruses , optimized SOP	1
3155	.	1
3156	. )	1
3157	Because of the high co - infection The severity of infection associated with HAdV varies depending on the different HAdV types [ 10 , 15 ]	1
3158	In addition , the prevalence of different HAdV serotypes varies among different geographical regions [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
3159	Our study indicated that HAdV was frequently detected in @DISEASE$ children from 2008 to 2010 ( 52 / 259 , 20	1
3160	1 % ) in Northern China ; this frequency was higher than that of cases in Eastern China ( 24 / 293 , 8	1
3161	2 % ) and in other studies [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] 19 ]	1
3162	The reasons for the marked differences are unknown	1
3163	We suggest that the cause may be the difference in species of the sample as well as the disease severity in the population studied	1
3164	However , further investigation is needed	1
3165	Furthermore , among the 76 HAdV samples , 25 ( 32	1
3166	9 % ) were identified as HAdV - 7 ( HAdV - B ) , and 15 ( 19	1
3167	7 % ) as HAdV - 3 ( HAdV - B ) , representing the most common molecular types	1
3168	Previous studies have found that HAdV - B was the most common species in southern China [ 26 ] , and HAdV - 3 was the predominant type of HAdV - B	1
3169	And another study reported HAdV - 3 ( HAdV - B ) outbreak associated with febrile respiratory disease in Eastern China in 2011 [ 27 ]	1
3170	In the present study the most dominant HAdV - C strains were HAdV - 1 ( 11 , 14	1
3171	47 % ) , followed by HAdV - 2 ( 9 , 11	1
3172	84 % ) , and HAdV - 5 ( 8 , 10	1
3173	52 % )	1
3174	Other HAdV - C types including HAdV - 6 , HAdV - 2 / 6 and HAdV - 57 , as well as HAdV - D ( HAdV - 37 ) and	1
3175	@DISEASE$ is an economically important @DISEASE$ in pigs due to financial losses [ 1 ]	1
3176	This disease occurs most frequently within the 2 weeks after weaning and is characterized by a profuse @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , significant mortality and loss of body weight of surviving pigs [ 2 ]	1
3177	Mortality associated with this disease may reach 20 - 30 % over a 1 - to 2 - month time span among infected weaned pigs during acute outbreaks of @DISEASE$ [ 1 ] .	1
3178	The estimated sample for the interview was 15 as they met inclusion criteria and 10 participants agreed and consented to participate , and data saturation was reached with six participants	1
3179	Interviews were terminated when data saturation was reached , that was when information was repeated and when the researcher probed , rephrased questions , and requested clarity but the information kept repeating itself .	1
3180	Given that we had observed resistance mutations in both @GENE$ after passaging virus in polyamine - depleted cells , we hypothesized that viral @GENE$ activity may be modulated by cellular polyamines	1
3181	While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance @GENE$ activity [ 32 , 33 ] , a role for polyamines in viral @GENE$ activity has never been reported	1
3182	Toward this end , we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines	1
3183	Following incubation with a drug , cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h , at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis	1
3184	Lysates were analyzed for the presence of @GENE$ , a cellular target of the @GENE$	1
3185	We observed that in infected cells , a distinct @GENE$ band was present ; however , in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm , @GENE$ cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A )	1
3186	We were unable to visualize full - length @GENE$ , likely due to its large size .	1
3187	Cinnamaldehyde - mediated inhibition of @GENE$ production found by Chao et al	1
3188	( 2008 ) [ 111 ] , and reported above , may be , at least on part , due to the reduction of ROS release as well as of those of @GENE$ and @GENE$ within LPS stimulated J774A	1
3189	1 macrophages .	1
3190	The essential oils of Fortunella japonica var	1
3191	margarita ( GumGyul ) and Citrus sunki ( JinGyul ) , which limonene predominared in both types of oils , also markedly inhibited LPS - induced NO production in RAW 264	1
3192	7 cells in a dose - dependent manner , indicating that they had anti - inflammatiry effects , according to the authors [ 138 ] .	1
3193	Since the emergence of @DISEASE$ , research has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the pathogenesis caused by it and other contemporary @DISEASE$ , such as SARS - CoV	1
3194	The efforts toward development of vaccines against this deadly virus have also been continuously increasing leading to the emergence of promising interventions	1
3195	The two viruses , in other words , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have some common challenges in the development of an efficacious vaccine	1
3196	As evident from reports , the aged population is more vulnerable to @DISEASE$	1
3197	The lesson learnt from preclinical studies of SARS - CoV suggests that vaccines fail to protect aged animals , while being effective in young ones	1
3198	Similarly , in clinical settings , the risk of mortality is even higher in individuals with @DISEASE$ or an immunocompromised state	1
3199	An effective vaccine , thus , should offer universal protection , including the vulnerable populations	1
3200	To do so , there is a need to evaluate the promising vaccines in the comorbid @DISEASE$ and the immunocompromised rodent models	1
3201	Since the virus can comfortably replicate in macrophages , the risk of vaccine - derived immunopathology cannot be negated and must be considered using heterologous challenge models	1
3202	Further , balance must be struck between protection and excessive immune activation while evaluating a successful vaccine candidate	1
3203	The vaccine development against @DISEASE$ is mostly influenced by the SARS - CoV	1
3204	However , to aid the development of better vaccines , there is need to further enhance the knowledge of pathology of @DISEASE$ and outline critical differences between SARS and @DISEASE$	1
3205	mAbs offers a w@GENE$  of opportunity , as a few candidates have shown potency in in vitro testing	1
3206	However , care needs to be taken in humanizing mAbs so as to m@GENE$ ze the antimouse antibody response	1
3207	Epitopes identified from mouse neutraliz@GENE$ zed for humanizing MERS - CoV	1
3208	mAbs targeting RBD are reporte@GENE$  have higher potency than therapies directed against other S protein regio@GENE$  as these could recognize critical residues for DPP4 binding	1
3209	@GENE$ er , changes in such critical residues may render these mAbs ineffectiv@GENE$  lead to development of escape mutant strains of the virus	1
3210	As discussed , a few promising peptides have also been developed against @DISEASE$ CoV	1
3211	The antiviral activity , stability and solubility of these peptides can be further improved similar to the peptides developed against HIV	1
3212	This will lead to the development of optimized next generation peptides having better inhibitory action directed against MERS - CoV	1
3213	Alternatively , as a novel approach , the peptide inhibitors can be combined with mAbs ( e	1
3214	g	1
3215	, RBD specific )	1
3216	The combination can be evaluated for the synergistic effect against divergent and resistant strains	1
3217	Studies are also needed to explore novel delivery technologies and optimizing vaccine immunity with a suitable combination of adjuvants	1
3218	In summary , there have been encouraging results in the area of the development of MERS - CoV vaccines in preclinical settings	1
3219	However , there are challenges related to efficacy , safety and drug delivery that need further consideration before proceeding to clinical trials	1
3220	Focused research in this direction can help reduce the disease burden caused by MERS - CoV and prevent outbreaks , especially among the aged and immunocompromised population .	1
3221	Limited information is available about @DISEASE$ abnormalities in cats and it is only based on case reports	1
3222	Mild to severe @DISEASE$ is the most frequent @DISEASE$ reported in clinical cases [ 37 ]	1
3223	Moderate to severe @DISEASE$ may be observed [ 37 , 50 , 57 ] in association with @DISEASE$ , but some of the cats reported with @DISEASE$ were FIV positive [ 37 , 50 , 57 ]	1
3224	Curiously , in one of these cases , amastigotes were found in 4 % of neutrophils in buffy coat smears [ 57 ] .	1
3225	FeL should also be considered in cats with @DISEASE$ , mainly in cats with @DISEASE$ and differentiated from similar clinical conditions caused by FIV , FeLV , FCoV , Bartonella , T	1
3226	gondii , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$	1
3227	Some @DISEASE$ cases are considered idiopatic and treated with corticosteroids	1
3228	A diagnosis of @DISEASE$ was initially made in some cases of ocular FeL and corticosteroids worsened the disease [ 50 , 55 , 69 ]	1
3229	This fact warrants a careful investigation Fig	1

3232	May - Grünwald - Giemsa stain , scale bar = 20 μm to exclude FeL before treating ocular disease with corticosteroids .	1
3233	A previous study concluded that exogenous expression of @GENE$ , an @GENE$ , mediates cell cycle arrest at S phase ( Yu et al	1
3234	)	1
3235	Given this finding , we examined whether @GENE$ of EV - D68 had the same ability to mediate cell cycle alteration	1
3236	Transfection of 3D expression vector ( 2 µg ) induced G0 / G1 arrest , with an increase in the percentage of G0 / G1 cells from 39	1
3237	37 ± 0	1
3238	52 % to 44	1
3239	76 ± 1	1
3240	29 % ( 13	1
3241	69 % increase ; P < 0	1
3242	01 ) and a corresponding increase in the G0 / G1 - G2 / M ratio from 2	1
3243	02 ± 0	1
3244	04 to 2	1
3245	62 ± 0	1
3246	18 ( 29	1
3247	70 % increase ; P < 0	1
3248	01 ) ( Figure 4A )	1
3249	Furthermore , the extent of the increase in the percentage of G0 / G1 cells was dependent on the dose of @GENE$ ( 0 , 0	1
3250	5 , 1 , 2 µg ; R = 0	1
3251	932 ; P < 0	1
3252	001 ) , and the G0 / G1 to G2 / M ratio also depended on the dose of 3D vector ( R = 0	1
3253	827 ; P < 0	1
3254	001 ; Figure 4B )	1
3255	These results suggest that the @GENE$ of EV - D68 contributes to G0 / G1 arrest .	1
3256	To confirm that G2 / M synchronization inhibits EV - D68 and EV - A71 , we assessed the effects of an alternate agent that can exert G2 / M arrest in vitro , pseudolaric acid B ( PAB ) , which The progeny viruses of EV - D68 or EV - A71 in the supernatant were titrated using RD cells , and the TCID50 / mL was shown	1
3257	The results indicate the mean ± S	1
3258	D of three independent experiments	1

3260	05 , * * P < 0	1
3261	01 , and * * * P < 0	1
3262	001 .	1
3263	To ensure that the @GENE$ that we had identified were indeed associated with the pulmonary myocardium and not the smooth muscle present in small arteries and surrounding the bronchus , we performed correlation analysis using @GENE$	1
3264	The top 100 transcripts correlated with @GENE$ were enriched for @GENE$ [ including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ] , and did not significantly overlap with @GENE$ ( Table S2 in File S2 ) .	1
3265	In situations where only partial network information is available , it may be necessary to reconstruct the network	1
3266	Different approaches can be applied to construct contact networks	1
3267	The most basic methods involve random sampling of nodes ( i	1
3268	e	1
3269	individuals or farms [ 28 ] ) or random sampling of edges ( i	1
3270	e	1
3271	links between nodes )	1
3272	However , it may be possible to capture the key properties of a network more efficiently using an approach such as snowball sampling ( SBS )	1
3273	SBS is typically used in situations where the target population is small and hard to find	1
3274	A number of individuals from the target population are asked to nominate an x number of people from the target population [ 29 ]	1
3275	This method has been used previously to identify networks of sexual contacts for @DISEASE$ - positive individuals [ 30 ]	1
3276	In the case of livestock , when there may be knowledge regarding the size of farms or number of aggregated movements from a farm ( per year ) , a targeted sampling approach could be used where larger farms or farms with the highest number of movements are sampled	1
3277	When constructing networks , including specific network characteristics ( such as age structure ) improves the quality of the constructed network [ 31 ]	1
3278	Previous studies have shown that subsets of networks are not always representative of the whole network ( e	1
3279	g	1
3280	scale - free networks [ 28 ] )	1
3281	Therefore , caution is needed when networks are constructed with partial data .	1
3282	On day 10 pi , one out of four birds had virus RNA in the spleen ( Figure 2 )	1
3283	None of the organs collected on day 18 pi was positive by qRRT - PCR	1
3284	Figure 1 Laying performance of challenged and control birds in experiment 1	1
3285	Eggs were collected throughout the experiment , three times a day , keeping handling of animals to the minimum , in order to avoid the occurrence of stressful events	1
3286	We compared the egg production between challenged and control birds on a weekly basis , adopting the Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - ranks on daily mean values for each group	1
3287	Significance level was set at P < 0	1
3288	05	1
3289	Data are shown here as mean ± standard deviations	1
3290	The differences in the weekly egg production between the two groups were significant ( P < 0	1
3291	05 ) for 9 weeks after the challenge .	1
3292	The subjects with fibrin on the peritoneum had also oviducts with @DISEASE$ walls , in which we found defective small eggs , abundant mucus , fibrin clots and purulent exudate , from day 4 up to day 10 pi ( Figure 4 ) .	1
3293	Interestingly , @GENE$ treatment - but not the rVV - CN2 or rVV - CN5 treatment - efficiently induced a HCV - specific activated CD8 T cells response ; this difference in efficacy could have one or more possible causes	1
3294	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) in the @GENE$ may cause the difference ; Saito et al	1
3295	reported that injection with @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ induced a specific CTL response in BALB / c mice [ 24 ]	1
3296	Reportedly , CTL activity against core or @GENE$ is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ , but core - specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ [ 21 ]	1
3297	In contrast , when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the @GENE$ were injected into BALB / c mice , only the @GENE$ markedly suppressed vaccinia - specific CTL responses [ 25 ]	1
3298	Thus , the @GENE$ may have an immunomodulatory function [ 26 ]	1
3299	Based on these reports and our results , we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV - N25 treatment were as follows : 1 ) this @GENE$ included the core and @GENE$ and 2 ) the @GENE$ had an immune - suppressive effect on CTL induction	1
3300	Therefore , we suggest that exclusion of the @GENE$ as immunogen is one important factor in @DISEASE$ vaccine design .	1
3301	Here , we used @GENE$ - induced expression of @GENE$ to generate HCV transgenic mice in order to study the effect of @GENE$ and confirmed that these mice developed @DISEASE$ - including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
3302	These pathological findings in the transgenic mice were very similar to those in humans with @DISEASE$ ; therefore , this mouse model of @DISEASE$ may be useful for analyzing the immune response to @DISEASE$	1
3303	However , experimental results obtained with this mouse model may not directly translate to clinical findings from patients with @DISEASE$ because the expression of HCV proteins was not liver specific in these mice	1
3304	F@GENE$ poly ( I : C ) injection can activate innate immune r@GENE$ consequently , might induce temporary @DISEASE$ [ 18 ]	1
3305	Additionally , poly ( I : C ) injection has an adjuvant effect ; specif@GENE$ mulates TLR3 signaling [ 19 ] .@GENE$ 	1
3306	Conclusion : Results indicate that LDV - induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 @GENE$ in pDC ' s that respond with a lymphocyte - inducing @GENE$ response .	1
3307	Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists , both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures	1
3308	Here , we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important , yet largely ignored , assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models .	1
3309	Furthermore , ZIKV - specific binding antibody responses were also assessed in mice immunised with @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ from a Brazilian strain and the MR766 strain described above	1
3310	Day 35 ( 1 week after third immunisation ) sera from pVax1 - and both non - consensus vaccine - immunised mice were analysed by ELISA for binding to rZIKV - E	1
3311	This analysis indicates that both @GENE$ and @GENE$ induced significant antibody binding , and that immunisation with the consensus @GENE$ - prME DNA vaccine generates an effective humoral response against rZIKV - E ( Supplementary Figure S1C , D ) .	1
3312	Although Kumar et al	1
3313	did not use CPP as a cell delivery system per se , it is noteworthy that they exploited its binding capability to polyanionic nucleic acids such as @GENE$ [ 15 ]	1
3314	The authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of @GENE$ into T cells in mice : they used an antibody to the @GENE$ as their delivery system by receptor - mediated endocytosis	1
3315	They bound the @GENE$ to the antibody through the positively charged nona - D - arginine ( 9R ) peptide conjugated to its C - terminal via a disulfide bond	1
3316	They successfully suppressed @DISEASE$ infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of thes@GENE$ s , inhibiting HIV - 1 entry into target cells and its replication .	1
3317	The poor cellular uptake of these uncharged compounds led Pandey and co - workers to covalently conjugate @GENE$ at its @GENE$ to various cell - penetrating peptides , including transportan , tat and penetratin , via disulfide bridges [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ]	1
3318	Upon coupling to these carrier peptides , the @GENE$ cargoes were rapidly taken up by different human cell types in culture	1
3319	When added to culture medium , these anti - HIV - 1 @GENE$ - CPP conjugates effectively inhibited HIV - 1 replication , @GENE$ - dependent trans - activation and viral production by infected cells ; no significant decrease was observed with the @GENE$ , emphasizing the great promise held by these conjugates as antiviral agents [ 91 ] .	1
3320	Protective properties of @GENE$ against viruses originate from their ability to trigger the production of potent @GENE$ in nearby cells	1
3321	The expression of one of these @GENE$ , the @GENE$ , is known to be directly stimulated by @GENE$ and can be used as marker for the induction of intracellular antiviral mechanisms by these @GENE$ in cats as well as in other species [ 19 , 64 ]	1
3322	Thus , as detection of @GENE$ on a protein level is rendered difficult by the unavailability of @GENE$ specifically recognizing these proteins , mRNA levels of @GENE$ were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216 , as indication for production of @GENE$	1
3323	Transcription of @GENE$ was significantly enhanced and remained proportional to mRNA expression of @GENE$ in stimulated PBMCs of individual cats ( Figure 4A	1
3324	In a final step , the induction of antiviral responses by ODN 2216 was measured in vivo and characterized using ex vivo assays	1
3325	The molecule was administered once subcutaneously to two cats ( c07 and c08 ) , while two other cats ( c05 and c06 ) received endotoxin - free PBS as a negative control	1
3326	The injections were well tolerated by all cats : no rise in body temperature , no local reactions at the injection site and no other undesired side effects were noted	1
3327	Absolute monocyte counts increased 1	1
3328	5 to 2 - fold in the first 12 h in cats that had received ODN 2216 ( data not shown )	1
3329	No other treatment - specific alterations were noted in hematological values throughout the experiment	1
3330	@GENE$ expression was measured in blood at early time points after injection as marker for the induction of antiviral immune processes	1
3331	@GENE$ levels of @GENE$ increased by 8	1
3332	8 and 3	1
3333	8 - fold within 24 h in both treated cats and decreased gradually thereafter until 192 h post treatment ( Figure 7A )	1
3334	In accordance with observations from in vitro experiments , cat c08 exhibited a stronger response to ODN 2216 than cat c07	1
3335	No increase in @GENE$ expression was observed in the blood of the control cats ( c05 and c06 )	1
3336	In a further experiment , plasma was collected from all four cats at regular intervals post injection and was utilized in an in vitro inhibition assay	1
3337	The plasma obtained from both treated cats 24 and 48 h after administration of the molecule was able to inhibit replication of FCV in vitro ( Figure 7B )	1
3338	In contrast , plasma from untreated cats seemed to slightly enhance the susceptibility of target cells to FCV inoculation .	1
3339	Examples of free radicals which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation ( indirect method ) are 2 , 2 ' - azinobis ( 3 - ethylbenzothiazoline - 6 - sulfonate ) ( ABTS ) or 2 , 2 - diphenyl - 1picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) , both with different colour according to the redox status	1
3340	Another example of indirect method is based on the reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + , in the presence of 2 , 4 , 6 - trypyridyl - s - triazine	1
3341	This method is known as FRAP ( ferric reducing antioxidant power )	1
3342	There are also methods based on the chemiluminescence of luminal in the presence of free radicals , which can be produced through AAPH [ 29 ] .	1
3343	Different groups of viruses , such as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( HIV - 1 ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , utilize eEF1A as cofactor@GENE$ iral transcription , translation and assembly	1

3352	Compared with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ is not common in young Nepalese children [ 62 ]	1
3353	To avoid including cases of undiagnosed @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , we did not include children that had been coughing for more than 14 days and we reassessed respiratory rate in @DISEASE$ after salbutamol administration before diagnosis of @DISEASE$ [ 20 ]	1
3354	The number of @DISEASE$ cases in Nepal has decreased dramatically since 2003 [ 63 ]	1
3355	@DISEASE$ vaccination is recommended at 9 months and the vaccine coverage among those that were 9 months or older in our study area was > 90 % ( unpublished data )	1
3356	Moreover , less than 1 % of our cases had a @DISEASE$ and all of these were above 1 year of age	1
3357	Thus , we believe that our sample consisted of children with @DISEASE$ , and not @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ .	1
3358	The study had ethical clearance from the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Western Norway	1
3359	The implementation of the project was in agreement with the international ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects as stated in the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration .	1

3364	Despite the progress that has been observed in modern pig farms during the last decade to prevent @DISEASE$ and improve global animal health , @DISEASE$ remains a problem that causes significant economic losses in pig production	1
3365	Antibiotics have contributed significantly to mitigate the economic losses caused by @DISEASE$ and particularly @DISEASE$ in swine	1
3366	However , increasing bacterial resistance leading to therapeutic failures on farms as well as the greater vigilance of consumers regarding antimicrobial residues , have resulted in more intensive research and a large number of clinical trials for the development of alternatives to antimicrobials	1
3367	Thus , several alternatives have been developed , some of which have been commercialized for the management of @DISEASE$ in pigs	1
3368	However , the effectiveness of these news therapies has been variable from one farm to another due to the management of livestock and farm conditions	1
3369	Although	1
3370	Thirty - four workers participated in the study ( Table 1 ) : 31 from 11 LPHCs and three from two EMS units	1
3371	Twenty ( 58	1
3372	8 % ) responders were male ; their mean age was 44 ( 34 - 56	1
3373	7 ) years	1
3374	Twenty - five participants ( 73	1
3375	5 % ) occupied health - related positions : 11 ( 32	1
3376	4 % ) general health - care staff , 6 ( 17	1
3377	6 % ) nurses , 4 ( 11	1
3378	8 % ) doctors , 3 ( 8	1

3381	Nine participants ( 26	1

3383	7 % ) technicians , 2 ( 5	1
3384	9 % ) administrators , 1 ( 2	1
3385	9 % ) agricultural worker and 1 ( 2	1
3386	9 % ) unknown .	1
3387	The experimental data show that foodborne transmission , e	1
3388	g	1
3389	, via consumption of infected honeybees , can be an underlying mechanism , which enables DWV to infect M	1
3390	rubra and potentially other arthropod predators and scavengers [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] 37 ]	1
3391	Indeed , both treatment groups that were fed with virus - infected honeybee pupae had consistently higher viral titers than the controls	1
3392	Since symptomatic honeybees with an overt infection have 10 10 + genomic equivalents of DWV and at lower infection levels 10 3 - 10 9 genomic copies [ 67 ] , the titers observed in M	1
3393	rubra seem to reflect covert infections	1
3394	However , the average honeybee worker ( ~ 120 mg ) weights about 60 times more than a M	1
3395	rubra worker [ 68 , 69 ]	1
3396	When controlled for these bodyweight differences , the DWV A and B titers found in the treatment groups therefore almost reach infection levels per mg ant - tissue analogous to an overt infection in bees	1
3397	Further , the viral titers were very low in the control colonies , thereby indicating that DWV A and B were only replicating in the treatments	1
3398	Interestingly , the ratios of DWV type - B to type - A were very similar in the ants , regardless of the treatment ( 4	1
3399	17 / 1 ( T1 ) , 5	1
3400	46 / 1 ( T2 ) , as well as in the injected honeybee pupae ( 5	1
3401	88 / 1 for DWV - B to DWV - A ) , thereby suggesting that both strains had similar reproductive capacities in both hosts .	1
3402	Two species of the blow fly , C	1
3403	nigribarbis and A	1
3404	graham , are categorized as larger - sized fly species in particular in comparison to the house fly Musca domestica ( L	1
3405	) ; its body size is 5 - 8 mm ( Figure 2 )	1
3406	The body length of female C	1
3407	nigribarbis is 11 - 15 mm and approximately 1	1
3408	5 times larger than that of female A	1
3409	grahami ( 8 - 13 mm )	1
3410	The capacity of the crop of female C	1
3411	nigribarbis ( average = 23 mL ) is approximately five times greater than that of female A	1

3414	The consumption rate of both C	1
3415	nigribarbis and A	1
3416	grahami might have been high because of their large body size	1
3417	In fact , @GENE$ genes were found more often in C	1
3418	nigribarbis than in A	1
3419	grahami [ 11 ]	1
3420	Stable flies , Muscina stabulans ( Falle ' n ) and M	1
3421	angustifrons ( Loew ) , collected at the same collection sites and the same time as the fly surveillance in Kyoto , showed much smaller body size than C	1
3422	nigribarbis and A	1
3423	grahami , and no virus was detected in these smaller - sized flies [ 11 ] .	1
3424	Target sequences for @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were chosen based upon common identity between different @GENE$ in the EMBL database containing the @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
3425	The sequences of the targets and positions of the primers are provided ( see Additional file 1 ) .	1
3426	While therapeutic veterinary gastrointestinal diets are commonly utilized in veterinary practice for the management of @DISEASE$ , this was the first study to evaluate the efficacy of these diets in vomiting cats with @DISEASE$	1
3427	The majority of cats in this study presented with @DISEASE$ represented in 25 of the 28 cats ( 89 % )	1
3428	There were no statistical differences between dietary treatments in the weekly mean vomiting frequency or change in weekly vomiting frequency over time	1
3429	However , looking within dietary groups , cats fed Diet A showed a significant reduction in @DISEASE$ occurrences in weeks 2 - 4 compared to baseline , with a 63 % reduction in the final week compared to baseline	1
3430	Cats fed Diet B , while not reaching statistical significance , also showed a numerical reduction from baseline over the study period	1
3431	Follow - up studies with additional cats are needed to better define the efficacy of Diet B and any potential differences between dietary treatments .	1
3432	Enterovirus D68 ( EV - D68 ) is an emerging pathogen that recently caused a large outbreak of severe @DISEASE$ in the United States and other countries	1
3433	Little is known about the relationship between EV - D68 virus and host cells	1
3434	In this study , we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV - D68 viral production , as well as the ability of EV - D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression	1
3435	The results suggest that synchronization in G0 / G1 phase , but not S phase , promotes viral production , while synchronization in G2 / M inhibits viral production	1
3436	Both an early EV - D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV - D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0 / G1 phase , thus providing favorable conditions for virus production	1
3437	Cell cycle regulation by EV - D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins an@GENE$  whi@GENE$ re observed at the level of the protein and / or mRNA	1
3438	Fur@GENE$ ore , the viral non @GENE$ 8 prevents progression from G0 / G1 to S	1
3439	Interestingly , another member of the Picornaviridae family , EV - A71 , differs from EV - D68 in that G0 / G1 synchronization inhibits , rather than promotes , EV - A71 viral replication	1
3440	However , these viruses are similar in that G2 / M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses , which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus	1
3441	These results further clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of @DISEASE$ and provide a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of @DISEASE$ .	1
3442	We demonstrate the importance of using seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models ( SARIMA ) with covariates in the modeling of respiratory - related time series data	1
3443	We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory - complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied	1
3444	Our simulations show that the balance between specificity , sensitivity , and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter	1
3445	The linear and exponential filters provide a good balance .	1
3446	There were many reports suggesting a lack of awareness of @DISEASE$ from the public	1
3447	Many participants reiterated the fact that General Practitioners ( GPs ) may succumb to the pressure of demanding patients to prescribe antibiotics even when they were not clinically indicated	1
3448	The next quote highlights how patients are " always asking for antibiotics " : " Patients will always come in and ask for antibiotics	1
3449	So I think it ' s something that we should control and not say that it all is well and then we ignore it	1
3450	But like I said (	1
3451	.	1
3452	) I think the awareness may not be strong enough for us to continue to pursue	1
3453	" - I01 , Human Health It was also highlighted that there is a need for a firm drilling of infection prevention and control practices right in formative years of training for all healthcare professionals	1
3454	Healthcare professionals needed to be more aware of and prioritize infection control , as it is not currently under " anyone ' s radar except for the people who do infection control " : " As far as infection prevention goes , infection prevention and antimicrobial resistance is like stepchild of everyone	1
3455	Because it ' s not in anyone ' s radar except for people who do infection control	1
3456	So it ' s about making it a culture in everyone ' s mind , which is not an easy task	1

3458	A regional network approach can enhance both bat conservation and @DISEASE$ mitigation efforts	1
3459	For instance , longitudinal studies of regional bat populations will aid in identifying shared threats to bats and human - mediated factors associated with increased disease emergence risk , both of which will likely change over time	1
3460	Yet few bat research networks actively incorporate capacity building and hands - on - training in disease surveillance ; however , the Red Latinoamericana para la Conservación de los Murciélagos ( RELCOM ) identifies emerging diseases as a conservation priority [ 79 ] and the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Unit ( SEABCRU ) provides protocols on personal protective equipment and safety when conducting @DISEASE$ surveillance [ 80 ]	1
3461	The Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats ( EUROBATS ) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop of public health officials , bat experts , and veterinarians to coordinate otherwise disjunct surveillance efforts for European bat lyssaviruses ( EBLV ) in several European countries [ 81 ]	1
3462	This workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on @DISEASE$ and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for @DISEASE$ surveillance programs in all European countries	1
3463	Taken together , collaboration is required among diverse experts , including bat conservationists , public health officials , and virologists , in order to build impactful One Health research agendas and formulate effective recommendations to mitigate shared regional threats to bat populations and human health .	1
3464	The filter - based detection method requires knowledge of the " true " values of the model parameters	1
3465	In our work , we replace the parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates .	1
3466	Given that @GENE$ are typical @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and that the signature of a broad antiviral type I @GENE$ response accompanies HIV - 1 replication both in vivo and ex vivo [ 27 , 28 ] , we reasoned that @GENE$ may be present not only in target cells , but also in virus - producing cells during the de novo assembly of virion particles	1
3467	Therefore , we explored the role that @GENE$ may play in HIV - 1 producing cells	1
3468	The results we have obtained indicate that @GENE$ coalesce with the structural protein @GENE$ and are incorporated into HIV - 1 viral particles both in established cell lines , as well as in primary human monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM )	1
3469	Virions incorporating @GENE$ display decreased infectivity when compared to HIV - 1 wild type particles in single round infection assays and a similar inhibition is observed for different retroviruses and Envelope ( Env ) pseudotypes	1
3470	Virions incorporating @GENE$ display a defect at the step of viral entry into target cells that well correlates with the infectivity defect measured here .	1
3471	Currently , three laboratory infection systems have been developed to study @DISEASE$ infections of reservoir hosts : @DISEASE$ ( SEOV ) infection of the Norway rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) , @DISEASE$ ) infection of the bank vole ( Myodes glareolus ) , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) infection of the deer mouse ( Peromyscus maniculatus ) [ 12 , 14 , 16 ]	1
3472	In humans , these viruses are etiologic agents of @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ; @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ; @DISEASE$ ) [ 1 ]	1
3473	These diseases share many pathologic similarities and because little damage to the endothelium occurs during infection , it is thought that the inflammatory immune response contributes to pathogenesis [ 17 , 18 ]	1
3474	Because the Norway rat is a model organism with many specific reagents , including monoclonal antibodies to imm@GENE$ ant@GENE$ een made toward understanding the reservoir host immune response to SEOV [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
3475	Fewer methods and reagents are available for bank voles and deer mice	1
3476	Despite these limitations , emerging technologies will be useful for understanding why rodent reservoirs are infected without disease and why they are unable to clear infection	1
3477	A significant limitation of HFRS research is that none of the HFRS - causing hantaviruses cause disease in animal models	1
3478	However , two New World hantaviruses cause an @DISEASE$ in Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) : Andes virus ( ANDV ) and Maporal virus ( MAPV ) [ 22 , 23 ]	1
3479	ANDV causes most @DISEASE$ cases in South America ; however , no human cases of disease have been associated with @DISEASE$	1
3480	ANDV is hosted by the long - tailed pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys longicaudatus ) and MAPV is hosted by the delicate pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys delicatus ) [ 24 , 25 ]	1
3481	ANDV is considered an animal biosafety level - 4 pathogen in most nations , whereas MAPV is considered an ABSL - 3 virus [ 26 ] .	1
3482	What makes these peptides very attractive as a delivery system is their ability to promote intracellular uptake of conjugated cargoes [ 32 ]	1
3483	CPPs have successfully improved the cellular uptake of various cargoes including proteins [ 26 , 33 ] , nucleic acids ( oligonucleotides [ 34 , 35 ] , peptide - nucleic acids [ 36 , 37 ] , siRNAs [ 38 , 39 ] ) , nanoparticules [ 40 ] and liposomes [ 41 ] in a wide range of cells : mainly in mammalian cells , but also in bacteria [ 37 , 42 ] , yeasts [ 42 ] and protozoan parasites [ 43 , 44 ]	1
3484	CPPs have proven to be very efficient in delivering molecules into cells that are refractory to transfection such as primary lymphocytes [ 45 ]	1
3485	In 1999 , Schwarze et a l	1
3486	successfully delivered into all tissues in mice the 120 - kDa @GENE$ , which retained its enzymatic activity [ 46 ]	1
3487	Impressively , the conjugate had also crossed the blood - brain barrier and reached the brain tissues , which is usually restricted to small and highly lipophilic peptides	1
3488	CPPs offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic molecules that are 200 times larger than the current bioavailability size restriction [ 45 ]	1
3489	CPP - mediated delivery of bioactive compounds into model organisms for @DISEASE$ [ 47 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 48 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 49 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 50 ] and @DISEASE$ , support the strong therapeutic potential exerted by CPPs	1
3490	Clinical trials are taking CPP - based drugs a step closer to therapeutic applications	1
3491	An heptamer arginineconjugated cyclosporine A ( Psorban ) has entered phase II of a clinical trial for topical treatment of @DISEASE$ [ 29 , 51 ]	1
3492	The oligoarginine peptide allows the penetration of cyclosporine A into cells throughout the otherwise impermeable epidermis and dermis	1
3493	This review will focus on studies that explored the use of CPPs to deliver antisense agents into virusinfected cells and animal models ( Table 1 ) .	1
3494	The outcome of @DISEASE$ infections is determined by the repertoire and specificity of @GENE$ nes in a particular animal species	1
3495	The identification of candid@GENE$ nes and mechanisms is a key step in describing this repertoire	1
3496	Despite advances in genome sequencing , identification@GENE$ nes has largely remained dependent on demonstration of their activity against candidate viruses	1
3497	Howeve@GENE$ ins that directly interact with viral targets or antagonists also bear signatures of recurrent evolutionary adaptation , which can be used to identify candidate antivirals	1
3498	Here , we find that five out of seventeen genes that contain a domain that can catalyze the post - translational addition ADP - ribose to proteins bear such signatures of recurrent genetic innovation	1
3499	In particular , we find that all the genes that encode both ADP - ribose addition ( @GENE$ ins ) as well as recognition and / or removal ( @GENE$ ins ) activities have evolved under extremely strong diversifying selection in mammals	1
3500	Furthermore , such genes have undergone multiple episodes of gene duplications and losses throughout mammalian evolution	1
3501	Combined with the knowledge that some viruses also enc@GENE$ ins to counteract host immunity , our evolutionary analyses therefore implicate ADP - ribosylation as an underappreciated key step in antiviral defense@GENE$ mes .	1
3502	Our data clearly show that some non - frozen H1N1 genotypes occasionally appeared in the human population after H1N1 dropped from public concern after 1957 ( Figure 2 )	1
3503	These fall on the same mutation - count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 extinction	1
3504	However , these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic ( the porcine lineage had no extinction event , and hence no pause in mutation accumulation )	1
3505	Nearest neighbor calculations ( data not shown ) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage	1
3506	They cluster tightly with the 2009 - 2010 outbreak @DISEASE$ , all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses	1
3507	Thus , we included the 2009 - 2010 viruses and the nine isolated , nonoutbreak viruses in the " porcine " category	1
3508	In this same figure , we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after ( Figure 2 , circle ) fall directly on the trajectory of the non - frozen lineage	1
3509	This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re - introduction virus	1
3510	Kedwaii , et al	1
3511	[ 8 ] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses , an H1N2 and an H1N1 , from different continents , but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve	1
3512	Regardless , general attenuation due to genome - wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] associated with the 2009 pandemic	1
3513	The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1 , 889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain .	1
3514	Six red squirrels were submitted for post - mortem examination with gross skin lesions consistent with @DISEASE$ , and seven red squirrels were acquired with @DISEASE$ that were compatible with a @DISEASE$	1
3515	Of the three squirrels whose mortality was not thought related to @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , two had severe @DISEASE$ and the other a severe @DISEASE$	1
3516	As with the grey squirrels , swab samples effectively recovered both target and reference DNA in red squirrels , with only one arm swab failing to isolate squirrel DNA ( n = 6 for each cutaneous swab s@GENE$  for rectal swabs ) ( see absolute quantification results in the Online Resource S10 , Fig	1
3517	S10	1

3519	We identified 919 virus isolates in 887 ( 40	1
3520	0 % ) of the 2 , 219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result , of which 334 ( 15	1
3521	1 % ) yielded RSV , 164 ( 7	1

3528	@DISEASE$ occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study	1
3529	The largest peaks of @DISEASE$ occurrence coincided with peaks of @DISEASE$ infection , which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter	1
3530	The monthly number of @DISEASE$ infections was positively correlated with relative humidity ( r s = 0	1
3531	40 , P = 0	1
3532	01 ) , but not with temperature or rainfall	1
3533	An @DISEASE$ epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of @DISEASE$ cases was also associated with relative humidity ( r s = 0	1
3534	55 , P = 0	1
3535	0005 ) .	1
3536	In this study , the genome size of 4 Thai CaKoVs is 7 , 530 bp with one @GENE$ encoding 2 , 444 amino acids of a @GENE$ , which comparable to previous reports	1
3537	Genome organization of CaKoV includes @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ )	1
3538	Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with @DISEASE$	1
3539	It is noted that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania ( Fig	1
3540	3 )	1
3541	Phylogenetic analyses of 3D @GENE$ wed similar result which Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs ( G1 sub - cluster )	1
3542	This observation regarding to the sub - clusters of CaKoVs was in agreement with the previous study [ 23 ]	1
3543	On the other hand , based on VP1@GENE$ he viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups , US / EU / Africa subgroup and China / Thailand subgroup which similar to the previous reports [ 16 , 22 ] ( Figs	1
3544	4 and 5 ) .	1
3545	Patients treated with IVIG stayed for a median of 24	1
3546	5 days in the ICU ( 5 to 89 days ) and 28	1
3547	5 days in the Fig	1
3548	1 )	1
3549	Forty - three percent ( 12 out of 28 ) of these patients died ; three patients died within the first week due to @DISEASE$ ( n = 2 ) or @DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 )	1
3550	The control patients spent a median of 24 days in the ICU ( 1 to 56 days ) and 27 days in the hospital ( 1 to 88 days ) ; 52 % ( 15 out of 29 ) of these patients died	1
3551	Five patients died during within first week due to @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , and @DISEASE$ 24 h after admission , and others died of @DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ .	1
3552	@DISEASE$ was defined using the definition set forth by the Infectious Society of America / American Thoracic Society Consensus Guidelines [ 20 ]	1
3553	In short , @DISEASE$ was diagnosed when the patients had symptoms associated with @DISEASE$ and had new - onset @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ on chest X - rays or chest computed tomography scans	1
3554	We defined @DISEASE$ as any temperature greater than or equal to 38 ° C recorded by the tympanic route	1
3555	The body temperatures of all patients were checked every hour at admission day	1
3556	During the days after admission , the body temperature was often measured within 1 h when patients had a febrile sense or worsening signs of inflammation	1
3557	We also recorded body temperature at the beginning of antipyretics administration	1
3558	There is no standardized antipyretic treatment protocol for fever control	1
3559	In our study , antipyretic therapy was administered upon reaching a body temperature ≥ of 38 ° C	1
3560	The interval of antipyretics administration was according to pharmacodynamics , although we performed additional antipyretics treatment when patients had a @DISEASE$ ( two consecutive measurements ≥ 38 ° C ) and deterioration of clinical symptoms , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ within 6 h after antipyretics administration	1
3561	Responsiveness to antipyretic treatment was classified as follows : a complete response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38 ° C was observed after antipyretics treatment and sustained throughout ; a partial response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38 ° C was observed but there was a resurge during observation or a need for additional antipyretics ; and no response was recorded when a sustained body temperature above or equal to 38 ° C was observed after antipyretics use	1
3562	Unresponsive to initial antibiotic treatment was defined as observed deterioration as evidenced by worsening of clinical symptoms and signs and / or progression of lesions on radiological studies after 48 to 72 h of initial antibiotics treatment .	1
3563	As shown in Fig	1
3564	4c , the proteins involved in the stimulus - response were enriched , and most of them are reported to respond to @DISEASE$	1
3565	These proteins can be potential targets for controlling @DISEASE$	1
3566	Dynamic changes in the expressed pr@GENE$  were noted	1
3567	They were initially down - regulated at 12 and 24 hpi , followed by a rapid return to near basal levels at 36 hpi and slight up - regulation at 48 and 60 hpi	1
3568	Thus , 12 and 24 hpi were the best time points to study these proteins ( Fig	1
3569	4 ) .	1
3570	The quantification was also performed by Proteome Discoverer software 1	1
3571	3 , which can automatically calculate the relative abundance of iTRAQ - labeled peptides as well as the corresponding proteins	1
3572	Proteins identified with two or more unique peptides were considered as a highly confident identification and used for quantification	1
3573	Also , to ensure the accuracy of quantification , only the proteins whose coefficient of variation of three biological repeats were less than 20 % were identified as @GENE$	1
3574	The protein ratios were calculated from channels ( 114 / 113 to 119 / 113 ) for all proteins identified in each @GENE$ experiment	1
3575	Two identical mock samples , with @GENE$ labels of 113 and 114 , were used as references	1
3576	The fold threshold for changed protein fold - change ratios was set at ± 1	1
3577	20 , which covers a 95 % quantification area based on the normal distribution of two mock samples ( 113 versus 114 ) in all biological replicates 57	1
3578	Thus , the proteins with fold - change ratios ≥ 1	1
3579	20 or ≤ 0	1
3580	83 were selected as DEPs .	1
3581	Nurse ( N6 ) said : " the building where @DISEASE$ wards are allocated is old and needs refurbishment	1
3582	The infrastructure is very old and not user friendly for implementing principles of infection control .	1
3583	Nurse ( N6 ) reiterated that : " Most of our patients are very ill and their conditions are not good at all , you look at the person and see that chances are he / she might die , even though the hospital doesn ' t have enough resources for us to do our job , but ( emotional ) we can ' t just sit here and look we need to help those patients they become our responsibilities , we rather endanger our lives in order to save lives	1
3584	I remember we have several cases where two patients from one family will be admitted and their beds will be next to each other , it always happens that one will die and the other one will remain , it will be so touching some even ask if he / she will be fine , to avoid frustrating the patient we always request that he / she be transferred to another hospital	1
3585	" Nurse ( N3 ) indicated that : " Every time when I get to the wards I look at those kids some of them are very young and I just wish they would recover , they become so close to us like they are our own children or family members , we always encourage them to take medication and injections even when it is painful we help talk to them	1
3586	Most of patients have side effects and they will vomit after taking medication and we always have to go all out and look for the food because they will be hungry	1
3587	"	1
3588	The etiologies of the exacerbations are described in Figure 2	1

3590	01 ) , while in children ≥ 6 years 33 % of the exacerbations were triggered by an @DISEASE$ condition ( versus 3 % in children < 6 years ; <	1
3591	01 ) .	1
3592	A simple way to collect a subset of livestock movement data would be to randomly sample all movements from a given set of random farms ( i	1
3593	e	1
3594	using the RNS method )	1
3595	This method proved ineffective at reproducing the mean epidemics seen on the complete network	1
3596	An alternative strategy to collect movement data would be to randomly sample movements from any farm ( i	1
3597	e	1
3598	the RMS method )	1
3599	In a practical sense , this would be a much more difficult strategy to implement , requiring individual farmers to keep a record of livestock moving from their farm a given percentage of the time	1
3600	This method is found to be more effective than the RNS method , particularly in the case when within - market transmission occurs	1
3601	In that case , only 10 - 20 % of movements are required in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes	1
3602	For lower percentages , the model predicts smaller epidemics than observed using the true network data , and in that case suggested intervention strategies may not be sufficient to control outbreaks	1
3603	It may , however , be possible to make accurate predictions with a lower percentage of movement data when incorporating a Bayesian kernel approach to scale up a partially observed network [ 43 ]	1
3604	An alternative approach may be to adopt targeted movement sampling where movements would be recorded based on some criterion	1
3605	For example , particularly frequent movements between pairs of nodes could be recorded , or shipments involving a large number of animals	1
3606	Both these options were investigated , but neither proved to be particularly successful at reconstructing an accurate realization of the original network .	1
3607	After reconstructing the movement network , epidemics were seeded randomly in Cumbria , Aberdeenshire or Devon	1
3608	These three counties have a high number of cattle farms and livestock movements , and therefore epidemics starting in these counties are more likely to produce a high number of cases than in other parts of the UK	1
3609	Cumbria and Devon were also two major hotspots of infection during the UK @DISEASE$ outbreak in 2001 [ 3 ]	1
3610	A random source farm in each county was infected initially for each simulation , and we investigated the predicted final epidemic size , duration , peak size and the model prediction of the geographical spread of disease .	1
3611	Nasopharyngeal aspirates ( NPAs ) or induced sputum ( IS ) was collected from hospitalised children with @DISEASE$ in Beijing ( representing Northern China ; n = 259 ) and Zhejiang Province ( representing Eastern China ; n = 293 ) from 2007 to 2010	1
3612	The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , followed by sequence typing@GENE$ nts that targeted @GENE$ alf of the hexon gene	1
3613	In addition , co - infection with other human respiratory viruses , related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated .	1
3614	Moreover , since IBV and NDV viruses can invade the oviduct and cause @DISEASE$ in avian species , we carried out differential virological examinations on the oviductal swabs .	1
3615	Inactivation and labelling of the challenge virus were done according to van Riel et al	1
3616	[ 32 ]	1
3617	Briefly , inactivation was achieved by dialysis against 0	1
3618	1 % formalin for 3 days	1
3619	After inactivation , the virus was dialyzed against PBS	1
3620	We labelled the inactivated virus through an incubation of 1 h at room temperature with a 1 : 1 ( v / v ) 0	1
3621	5 mol / L bicarbonate buffer solution ( pH 9	1
3622	5 ) containing 0	1
3623	1 mg / mL of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA )	1
3624	The virus was dialyzed in PBS to release unbound FITC , using Pur - A - Lyzer tubes ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , for 6 h .	1
3625	@DISEASE$ infections have long been implicated as triggers of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , a @DISEASE$	1
3626	Epitope spreading , molecular mimicry , cryptic antigen , and bystander activation have been implicated a@GENE$ ponsible for activating self - reactive ( SR ) immune cells , ultimately leading to organ - specific @DISEASE$	1
3627	Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse @DISEASE$ virus ( JHMV ) - induced @DISEASE$ , this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells	1
3628	In this model , @DISEASE$ is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control	1
3629	However , their decline during persisting infection , despite ongoing @DISEASE$ , suggests an active control mechanism	1
3630	Antigen - specific IL - 10 - secreting CD4 + T cells ( Tr1 ) and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , both known to control @DISEASE$ and induced following @DISEASE$ infection , were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells	1
3631	Ablation of Foxp3 + Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4 + T cells within cervical lymp@GENE$ s ( CLN ) , albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls	1
3632	In contrast , infected IL - 27 receptor deficient ( IL - 27R − / − ) mice , characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells@GENE$ led that SR CD4 + T c@GENE$ LN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS	1
3633	These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T - cell - mediated @DISEASE$	1
3634	The JHMV model is thus valuable to decipher tissue - specific mechanisms preventing @DISEASE$ .	1
3635	Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of human metapneumovirus strains from Kenya and Zambia	1
3636	Although not the main focus of the current study , our integrated approach also provides phylogeographic reconstructions that offer insights into the global source - sink dynamics of human @DISEASE$	1
3637	The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally - sampled @GENE$ ( Fig	1
3638	3 ) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [ 14 , 33 ]	1
3639	We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution , thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 ( Fig	1
3640	3 )	1
3641	These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population , occupying close to 60 % of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies ( Fig	1
3642	3 ) , followed by Southeast Asia , which comprises about 15 % of the trunk time	1
3643	We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source - sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig	1
3644	3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China ( Fig	1
3645	3 )	1
3646	The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human @DISEASE$ results in a high net migration out of this air community ( Fig	1
3647	S4 )	1
3648	However , air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow , in particular the USA , which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season .	1
3649	For example our workflow component for ClustalW shows all the options that the original @GENE$ program presents to users	1
3650	The options are presented in a parameter output panel and translated into command line string for calling the underlying @GENE$ program upon execution of the workflow	1
3651	After the completion of @GENE$ , an output file is produced on the local hard disk at a specified location containing the aligned data set	1
3652	This file name and its location is the input for the next component ( e	1
3653	g	1
3654	@GENE$ )	1
3655	The remaining components , e	1
3656	g	1
3657	@GENE$ with its underlying @GENE$ operate in the same way .	1
3658	Quascade has been designed for research applications characterized by strict high performance requirements	1
3659	It provides a graphical , drag - and - drop interface to allow users to design and execute ad - hoc workflows	1
3660	Workflows are constructed by an end - user by inter - connecting functional blocks , called components	1
3661	A component is a piece of independent and self - contained code performing a given functionality on its input and generates an output	1
3662	Data paths among components can be specified by drawing lines between / among the output ( s ) and input ( s ) of different components , respectively	1
3663	Thereby , various combinations of these components ( such as one output to multiple inputs , multiple outputs to multiple inputs ) can be used to create any workflow depicting the flow of both data and logic .	1
3664	The coding sequences of @GENE$ were conserved at nucleotide and amino acid levels , by sharing > 85 % between - subgroup nucleotide identity and 90 % protein identity ( Table 3 )	1
3665	The @GENE$ was the most conserved among all subgroups at the nt and aa levels	1
3666	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were more divergent between the @DISEASE$ subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63 % identity , respectively .@GENE$ tein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution ( CAA [UNK] TAA ) at gene position 532 in group B , resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa , respectively	1
3667	The predi@GENE$ tein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups , between 219 and 241 aa , due to different positions of@GENE$ odon	1

3672	Alterations in short - term memory were demonstrated by the marked reduction in alternation behavior in the Y - maze test , which is consistent with previous reports 40 , 41 and is a persistent finding in poly ( I : C ) models 38	1
3673	The Y - maze test is well known as a hippocampal - dependent short - term learning task	1
3674	In our MIA model , a remarkable loss of neurons was observed in the amygdala and cerebral cortex of the offspring , but not in the hippocampus	1
3675	The formation of memory is encoded in a broad network of cortical / subcortical regions including the hippocampus , cingulate cortex , and amygdala 42	1
3676	Moreover , the amygdala is directly connected to and dynamically interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28	1
3677	Therefore , a decreased number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex could consequently result in @DISEASE$	1
3678	In this model , increased activation of astrocytes was observed in the white matter and amygdala , which be related to impaired short - term memory 28 , 41 .	1
3679	According to the current state of the art , cats are most likely a secondary reservoir of L	1
3680	infantum which will not support persisting infection in a natural setting if the primary reservoir is absent , e	1
3681	g	1
3682	cats alone would not be responsible for the persistence of @DISEASE$ infection in an area where disease transmission is possible with abundant competent sand fly vectors , unless infected dogs are present	1
3683	The epidemiological role of cats in the maintenance and transmission of @DISEASE$	1
3684	infantum should nevertheless be further investigated [ 43 ]	1
3685	Questions that need to be addressed include : 1 ) are cats involved in the transmission of parasite by sand fly vectors in endemic areas where both infected cats and dogs are present ? 2 ) how attractive are cats to vector sandflies ? 3 ) how accessible is the parasite in infected cats to sand flies ?	1
3686	@DISEASE$ have always been identified in the affected skin	1
3687	A semiquantitative estimation of amastigotes was also performed with the aid of immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) [ 68 ] , in which the parasitic load of the skin ranged from high ( > 50 immunolabelled amastigotes / field at x400 ) to moderate ( 10 - 50 immunolabelled amastigotes / field ) in cases of @DISEASE$ [ 68 ]	1
3688	Conversely , it was low ( 1 - 9 immunolabelled amastigotes / field ) in cases of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ [ 68 ] .	1

3691	Immunosuppression	1
3692	Early data , examining the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ recipients with @DISEASE$ , first reported that methylprednisolone treatment for @DISEASE$ led to a 4 - 100 - fold increase in serum HCV RNA [ 31 ]@GENE$ , an aggravated course of @DISEASE$ reinfection after LT and increased resistance to antiviral therapy have been attributed to the application of specific immunosuppressive medication [ 32 , 33 ]	1
3693	Herein , various immunosuppression strategies have been evaluated for their influence on @DISEASE$ recurrence .	1
3694	Possible causative agents were identified in 100 % of the Adv group patients and in 72	1
3695	8 % ( 134 / 184 ) of the Non - Adv group patients	1
3696	In some instances , Adv group patients had coinfections with viruses , such as rhinovirus ( n = 5 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 4 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , and @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 )	1
3697	Bacteria or combined etiologies were more common in the Non - Adv group patients	1
3698	Rhinovirus ( 40 / 184 , 21	1
3699	7 % ) was most commonly identified as the pathogen in the Non - Adv group patients	1
3700	The most common bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Adv group patients ( 11 / 67 , 16	1
3701	4 % ) and @DISEASE$ in the Non - Adv group patients ( 52 / 184 , 28	1
3702	3 % ) .	1
3703	We also found that this pattern of rapid evolution in @GENE$ extends to other vertebrate lineages	1
3704	Despite high conservation in the rest of the @GENE$ , the sequence and length of the largest exon ( corresponding to @GENE$ ) in @GENE$ is highly variable among vertebrates	1
3705	Consistent with our results in primates , all closely related pairs of @GENE$ analyzed demonstrated a signature of purifying selection throughout much of @GENE$ contrasting with evidence for positive selection in the region corresponding to @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( Figure 2D and Table S3 )	1
3706	To gain further insight into @GENE$ evolution outside of primates , we asked whether other mammalian lineages show evidence for recurrent positive selection as we observed in primates	1
3707	To do this , we took advantage of publicly available @GENE$ sequences , which , like primates , are divergent enough to provide sufficient evolutionary divergence , but not so divergent that the rate of synonymous mutation ( dS ) is saturated	1
3708	Using sequences from 10 bat species ( Alignment S2 ) , we again found that @GENE$ has evolved under recurrent positive selection in its largest exon ( @GENE$ p - value , 0	1
3709	0001 , @GENE$ pvalue , 0	1
3710	01 ) ( Figure @GENE$ )	1
3711	@GENE$ identified six positively sites with high confidence ( Figure @GENE$ , Table S5 )	1
3712	Although there is no overlap between @GENE$ identified in primates and bats , we found nine residues to be absolutely conserved across all 25 primate and bat species we analyzed ( Figure @GENE$ ) , suggesting substantial constraint even within this rapidly evolving @GENE$	1
3713	Combined , these broader phylogenetic analyses indicate that a single @GENE$ has been subject to positive selection throughout mammalian and bird evolution , suggestive of an ancient conflict with intracellular pathogens .	1
3714	With : Pr c ¼ Prevalence of microorganim detection in controls ; OR ¼ crude odds ratio :	1
3715	Non specific signs such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ also have been reported	1

3717	Animals ( mice ) pretreated with Pterodon emarginatus Vogel	1

3719	trans - Caryophyllene , β - elemene and germacrene D were the major components present in the present oil .	1

3723	To encourage other wildlife disease surveillance studies to develop qPCR assays with the potential to detect multiple pathogens along with an IC to assess qPCR quality , we describe the development of two qPCR assays that are capable of detecting both SQPVand SADV in a sample from either red or grey squirrels	1
3724	These assays thus present substantial improvements on current methods to detect these agents and will facilitate our understanding of the epidemiology of squirrel pathogens .	1

3740	All regions of interest were chosen based on areas where optimal images of moving cilia were visible to the observer	1
3741	The video sequences were reanalyzed by a second observer	1

3749	Infected cells were collected at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hpi , and uninfected mock - treated cells were collected at 0 and 48 h after plating	1
3750	All experiments were repeated in three biological replicates with cells at different passage numbers .	1
3751	Nurse ( N2 ) indicated that : " The most painful and traumatizing thing in the @DISEASE$ wards is that patients die in large numbers and it is so stressing to see people dying just before you every day	1
3752	We really need clinical psychologists to come and render counselling , but all they do is to schedule an appointment with us and never come to talk to us	1
3753	We do not get even debriefing sessions	1
3754	As a result , we feel that we are losing it , at times we just can ' t cope	1
3755	"	1
3756	For each patient presenting to the Pediatric ED , a record form is filled in by the nurse and medical staff , including demographic data , anamnestic information , vital signs , physical examination , treatment performed in the ER ( if done ) , clinical reevaluation after treatment , diagnosis , discharge modality , and home therapy prescription when applicable	1
3757	For children requiring a short - stay observation , prescribed examinations , therapy , and subsequent reevaluations are also noted on the same form .	1
3758	To achieve the greatest possible sensitivity and specificity , we chose two formats of gold - based immunoassays	1
3759	In the double antigen sandwich immunoassay , the @GENE$ labelled with colloidal gold is a soluble @GENE$	1
3760	During the test , @GENE$ in the sample react with antigen coated on the nitrocellucose membrane and @GENE$ , forming a @GENE$	1
3761	At the same time , we carried out a series of experiments to optimize different parameters , such as the amount of immunoreagents , the type of materials , and the composition of the blocking solution and detector reagent mixture	1
3762	The experimental results demon - strated that the chromatographic strip device we constructed is simple , sensitive and specific	1
3763	It is an ideal test for the screening of patients with @DISEASE$	1
3764	The presence of reco@GENE$ he strip may be crucial for the detection of @DISEASE$ infected patients with low antibody titers .	1
3765	In deer mice infected with @DISEASE$ , early expression signatures of a mixed Th1 / Th2 / Treg response were present in virus - specific CD4 + T cells , incl@GENE$  I@GENE$ , @GENE$ , Il@GENE$  Tgfβ , before transitioning to a Treg - like response at persistence [ 54 ]	1

3767	Some deer mice pro@GENE$ c IgG by day 10 while other@GENE$ d IgG around day 20 or later @GENE$ ibody was not detected until after 3 weeks	1
3768	. During acute infection , @DISEASE$ elicits a modest inflammatory response that initially limits , but does not clear , virus	1
3769	Within a few weeks , the response transitions to a regulatory response that may allow episodic recrudescence of virus that can be shed .	1
3770	The present study is an attempt to elucidate more fully the nature of mutational change in this historically important human pathogen .	1
3771	@GENE$ is highly conserved in evolution and was first identified as an @GENE$ with antiviral activity against human @DISEASE$ in 2001 [ 157 ]	1
3772	Over the last 17 years , viperi@GENE$ ined lot of attention and was shown to exhibit broad antiviral activity [ 158 ]	1
3773	Viperi@GENE$ o known as one of the most highly upregulated genes after viral infection [ 146 , 159 ]	1
3774	Within the family of flaviviridae , viperi@GENE$ en shown to inhibit several members , such as WNV [ 160 ] , DENV [ 161 ] , ZIKV [ 162 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 163 ] , and TBEV [ 86 , 141 , 149 , 150 ]	1

3783	However , the target for the radical SAM activity important for the antiviral activity of TBEV is currently unknown	1
3784	The structure of viperin was recently characterized [ 168 ] , and based on similarities to other radical SAM enzymes , several different hypothesis have been put forward regarding the substrate of viperin and its antiviral activity [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ]	1
3785	However , none of these have shown importance in the context of mammalian viral infection	1
3786	Although the exact mode of action against TBEV is not well understood , recent data indicates that viperin interacts with several viral proteins ; both structural prM and E and non - structural NS2A , NS2B , and NS3	1
3787	These interactions lead to a viperin - NS3 dependent degradation of viral proteins	1
3788	The degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent [ 150 ] ( Figure 3 )	1
3789	Interestingly , IFN treatment induces an increase of TBEV capsid particles and this effect was found to be dependent on viperin	1
3790	Viperin mediated this effect by interacting , via its N - terminus , with the cellular protein Golgi Brefeldin A resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 ( GBF1 ) [ 86 ]	1
3791	GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and essential in the life cycle of many RNA viruses , which utilize vesicular trafficking in their replication cycle and assembly process [ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] ( Figure 3 )	1
3792	Viperin targets the NS3 protein for proteasomal degradation which inhibits the synthesis of + strand RNA	1
3793	Furthermore , NS3 interacts with E , NS2A , and NS2B and these proteins are degraded by viperin in a NS3 - dependent manner	1
3794	Viperin also interferes with particle assembly by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII - dependent manner , independent of COPI	1
3795	Viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1	1

3803	Of the 100 pathogen - identified patients who had received antimicrobial agent for more than 24 hours prior to bronchoscopic BAL ( Figure 1 ) , 44 had @DISEASE$ , 54 had @DISEASE$ , and 2 had @DISEASE$	1
3804	Of the 98 patients with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , the median duration of antimicrobial therapy before bronchoscopic BAL was 5 days ( interquartile range , 3 - 9 days )	1

3813	The results of the trials to identify the best endogenous ICs are provided in the Online Resource S6 ( Tables S6	1
3814	1 and S6	1
3815	2 ) : a section of the @GENE$ was identified as an appropriate endogenous IC for both squirrel species .	1
3816	Due to the apparent localised @DISEASE$ that grey squirrels displayed ( Fig	1
3817	2 , see also ( Atkin et al	1
3818	2010 ) , diagnosis in this species can prove problematic particularly as no one single tissue can reliably be used to indicate grey squirrel @DISEASE$ status	1
3819	While previous attempts to use swabs to diagnose a @DISEASE$ in grey squirrels failed to identify infected individuals ( Collins et al	1
3820	2014 ) , swab samples provided several benefits in this study	1
3821	Swabs allow multiple sites and a greater sampling area to be surveyed without concern for overloading the sample with host DNA	1
3822	Thus@GENE$ le swab sampling the oral , eye and distal arm areas investigated would identify all infected individuals in this study and is recommended as the sampling method of choice in both squirrel species for SQPV detection alone ( Table 2 )	1
3823	Adding a rectal swab ( potentially combined with the cutaneous swab ) and blood would make one confident in detecting the majority of @DISEASE$ cases while also performing analysis for SQPV	1
3824	It should be noted , however , that reliability of using swabs depends upon the use of the endogenous IC that indicates adequate harvesting of cells ( via amplification of squirrel D@GENE$ 	1
3825	The 1918 Spanish @DISEASE$ pandemic resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide : most of the deaths were caused by secondary @DISEASE$ [ 53 , 54 ]	1
3826	During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , bacterial coinfection was detected in 18 - 34 % of @DISEASE$ cases ( reviewed by Chertow and Memoli [ 8 ] ) with vulnerability peaking 1 week after @DISEASE$ [ 55 ]	1
3827	The association of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ is not limited to @DISEASE$ although that interaction has been most studied : adenovirus , human metapneumovirus , @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , and other viruses have been temporally associated with an increased risk of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , defined as the isolation of S	1
3828	pneumoniae from a normally sterile site , in the USA ( Table 2 ) [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ]	1
3829	The majority of US studies suggest strong associations between @DISEASE$ ( both @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ and RSV , with potential effect modification by age	1
3830	Temporal associations with other viruses are less supported and limited to @DISEASE$	1
3831	We did not find any studies in the USA that examined temporal associations between viruses and bacterial species other than S	1
3832	pneumoniae	1
3833	Six studies conducted in other developed countries examined temporal associations between respiratory viruses and @DISEASE$ [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]	1
3834	Three out of five studies that examined influenza virus found associations with @DISEASE$ in UK , The Netherlands and Sweden [ 70 , 71 , 73 ]	1
3835	Among four studies that examined RSV in other countries , two indicated associations with @DISEASE$ in all age groups [ 70 , 71 ] , one found an association only among children [ 68 ] and the last observed an association only in individuals 2 years or older [ 69 ]	1
3836	Temporal associations provide evidence of virusbacterial interactions , but do not necessarily prove these interactions exist	1
3837	Many @DISEASE$ infections are seasonal , as is @DISEASE$ , so the temporal associations may merely reflect the influence of other seasonal phenomena , environmental or host , that are shared by both @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 74 ]	1
3838	However , evidence for true virus - bacterial interactions is supported by population studies that estimate a high prevalence of viral co - infection during @DISEASE$ [ 5 , 6 ] and animal models that suggest increased susceptibility to pneumonia and increased disease severity during viral co - infection [ 75 ]	1
3839	In the USA , 47 % of children and 19 % of adults with bacterial pneumonia are co - infected with one or more viruses [ 5 , 6 ]	1
3840	Further , vaccination for S	1
3841	pneumoniae reduced pneumonia associated with RSV , influenza A and parainfluenza ( PIV ) types 1 - 3 [ 76 ]	1
3842	Influenza vaccine probe studies may provide additional insight to the burden of influenza co - infection on bacterial pneumonia .	1
3843	Taking into account of both single infection and coinfection cases of @DISEASE$ , 46 bacterial pathogens were isolated from symptomatic children ; and the most commonly isolated bacteria were S	1

3849	On the other hand , 7 % ( 2 out of 30 ) nasal swab specimens which had been collected from asymptomatic participants were culture positive and only S	1
3850	pneumoniae was found in both cases	1
3851	The data obtained from symptomatic cases demonstrate for the first time that E	1

3858	( 2016 ) crystallized their complexes in the presence of an ubiquitin - bound substrate , Li et al	1
3859	( 2016 ) crystallized @GENE$ in complex with @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the absence of bound - ubiquitin , providing additional structural insight	1
3860	For example , the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ appears disordered or displaced in @GENE$ , whereas the four antiparallel β - sheets of the @GENE$ are rigid in other @GENE$ structures ( Hu et al	1
3861	, 2002 ; Avvakumov et al	1

3866	Binding of @GENE$ to the tip of the @GENE$ stabilizes the ' ' Pinky Finger ' ' and @GENE$ , which may ultimately propagate to the catalytic cleft in the presence of substrate ( Li et al	1

3868	@GENE$ also binds the @GENE$ via the ' ' top ' ' face of its @GENE$ but interacts with the bottom of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ to promote an optimal alignment of the catalytic cleft ( Li et al	1
3869	, 2016 )	1
3870	Together , these structural studies suggest that binding of the @GENE$ to @GENE$ or @GENE$ relatively far from the @GENE$ site results in the rearrangement of several structural elements , which propagates to the @GENE$ increasing enzyme catalysis .	1
3871	This study received approval from the bioethics committee of the KCDC ( 2015 - 08 - EXP - 03 - P - A ) and the institutional review board of the National @DISEASE$ Center ( NCC 2016 - 0058 )	1
3872	Informed consent was obtained from study participants or their parent or legal guardian for children under 14 .	1
3873	By some considerations , the ID - to - name conversion for viral sequences is both of particular relevance and of considerable complexity	1
3874	First , a large body of results in virus research can be linked to underlying sequences , owing to relatively small number of known viruses and comparatively small sizes of their extensively characterized @GENE$	1
3875	Second , the virus naming , at the species level and below , is not governed by either the binomial Latin name convention traditional for cellular organisms or another broadly accepted nomenclature [ 13 ] that complicates communication in virology	1
3876	For species , naming viruses is under auspices of the International Committee of Virus Taxonomy ( ICTV ) [ 14 ]	1
3877	At the isolate and strain level , it is left up to individuals or groups of researchers to decide how to proceed [ 15 , 16 ]	1
3878	Researchers studying few economically most important viruses developed nomenclatures restricted for these viruses [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
3879	In contrast , each decision about naming that concerns a majority of viruses is an ad hoc and , often , lengthy process	1
3880	Likewise , naming viruses with artificially designed genomes , which are not product of natural evolution [ 23 ] , is formally outside of the ICTV authority and completely unregulated .	1
3881	Foodborne virus transmission appears to be less important in honeybees , but may be relevant for transmission to other species [ 21 ] , especially for predators and scavengers [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ]	1
3882	However , data on foodborne @DISEASE$ transmission between honeybees and insect predators / scavengers are scarce .	1
3883	The literature identifies discourse with regard to the attribution of responsibility ; who is to blame for the outbreak and who should response ? Some of this literature assigned the blame and responsibility , for the outbreak , to people ' s cultures ( Dong 2008 ; Morinet et al	1
3884	2016 ) , which oversimplifies complex issues that result from complex processes , such as globalization , climate change , and global economics	1
3885	This kind of narrative reflects the politics of blame , which typically attributes responsibility for the sources of the outbreak to a cultural minority group and neglects the influence of colonialism and the social determinants of health , including overcrowding , poor sanitation , and poverty that increase these people ' s vulnerability ( Dry and Leach 2010 ) .	1
3886	Three 3D8 scFv TG mouse lines and the wild - type C57BL / 6 line were divided into five groups with or without @DISEASE$ infection ( WT - mock , WT - PRV , STG69 - PRV , STG90 - PRV , and STG135 - PRV )	1
3887	Mice were challenged with @DISEASE$ by intramuscular injection ( 10 LD 50 )	1
3888	Survival rates in each group were calculated at 12 hr intervals ( Figure S5 )	1
3889	Tissues ( muscle and brain ) were harvested and stored at 270uC for further RT - PCR and immunohistochemical analyses .	1
3890	" The Ministry keeps an eye out for how it compares itself to other countries	1
3891	So that drives their interest in looking at where we stand , how good , how bad (	1
3892	.	1
3893	) They directly fund quite a lot of the manpower in the hospital systems , certainly for antimicrobial stewardship	1
3894	" - I02 , Human Health Participants also remarked that the ministry looked at other countries and international organizations , such as the WHO and the European Union , for inspiration and implemented policies relevant to the Singapore context .	1
3895	HIV - 1 causes a @DISEASE$	1
3896	However , the mechanisms employed by the virus to cross genital tract tissue and establish infection are uncertain	1
3897	Since cervicovaginal fluid is acidic and HIV - 1 in cervicovaginal fluid is likely coated with antibodies , we exp@GENE$ ffect of low pH and HIV - 1 - specific @GENE$ he movement of HIV - 1 across tight - junctioned epithelial cells	1
3898	We found that the combination of HIV - 1 - specific @GENE$  transcytosis as much as 20 - fold	1
3899	Virus that underwent transcytosis under these conditions was infectious , and infectivity was highly influenced by whether or not the antibody neutralized the virus	1
3900	We observed enhanced transcytosis using antibody from cervi@GENE$  and seminal fluids and using transmitted / founder strains of HIV - 1	1
3901	We also found that the enhanced transcytosis was due to the Fc neonatal recepto@GENE$ nd@GENE$ une complexes at@GENE$ leases them at neutral pH	1
3902	Finally , staining of human tissue revealed abundant FcRn expression on @GENE$ nar epithelial cells of penile urethra and endocervix	1
3903	Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein HIV - 1 may facilitate its own transmission by usurping the antibody response directed against itself	1
3904	These results have important implications for @DISEASE$ vaccine development and for understanding the earliest events in @DISEASE$ transmission .	1
3905	Human respiratory epithelium was obtained by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate with a 2 - mm cytology brush ( Keymed , Southend - on - Sea , UK ) as previously described [ 7 ]	1
3906	Cells were dislodged from the brush into M199 medium and grown to a ciliated phenotype at air - liquid interface as previously described [ 17 ]	1
3907	Ethical approval for the collection of nasal epithelial cells was given by the Leicestershire Ethical Review Committee .	1

3909	The PICU physician documented demographic characteristics , underlying @DISEASE$ , influenza vaccination status , diagnostic findings , @DISEASE$ - associated diagnoses and complications , treatment , duration of hospital and PICU stay , and outcome in a structured questionnaire	1
3910	A respiratory sample , usually a flocked nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal swab , was collected on the day of PICU admission for PCR - confirmation of @DISEASE$	1
3911	Microbiological testing for bacteria or fungi was at the discretion of the PICU physician ; pathogens detected at usually sterile sites or in tracheal aspirates were classified as bacterial or fungal co - infection .	1
3912	In this work , a multiphase numerical model based on the Eulerian - Lagrangian approach was adopted , which has been widely employed in aerosol dynamics simulation in enclosed environments [ 17 , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]	1
3913	In this approach , the governing equations of the carrier phase were numerically solved in the computational geometry based on the Eulerian framework [ 23 ]	1
3914	Transient species transport model for water vapor was added to the Eulerian carrier phase models to represent the humidity in the air [ 23 ]	1
3915	For the discrete phase , the governing equations were described in the Lagrangian framework	1
3916	Each aerosol released from the injections point was tracked individually in the Lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position and velocity .	1
3917	Hantaviruses are hosted by rodents , insectivores and bats	1
3918	Several rodent - borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans , @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ in Eurasia or @DISEASE$ in the Americas	1
3919	It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases	1
3920	However , in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined , little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses	1
3921	Because most @DISEASE$ reservoirs are not model organisms , it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur	1
3922	Despite these limitations , recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to @DISEASE$ by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus / reservoir relationships .	1

3931	It is difficult to ascertain if @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ had contributed to this fatal illness	1
3932	These pathogens were detected in the tracheal and the nasopharyngeal aspirates but not in the postmortem lung tissue cultures .	1
3933	We detected @DISEASE$ in 25 of the 36 study months	1
3934	The largest @DISEASE$ peaks occurred in winter from December to February in the first two years , but we also isolated @DISEASE$ during the monsoon period	1
3935	A summer outbreak of @DISEASE$ has previously been reported from Nepal [ 39 ]	1
3936	Surveillance data from 2007 at the Kathmandu sentinel site has showed that @GENE$ was prevalent throughout the year except in May , and that @GENE$ prevailed during June to August and reappeared in December [ 40 ]	1
3937	Unlike in temperate regions , where @DISEASE$ occurs in well - defined outbreaks lasting 2 to 3 months once a year in the winter , @DISEASE$ is detectable for a greater part of the year in tropical and sub - tropical regions and the timing of outbreaks is less predictable [ 41 , 42 ]	1
3938	Influenza peaks have been reported to occur during periods of high rainfall in many tropical locations [ 12 ] .	1
3939	The 3D8 scFv cell line expresses @GENE$ in both the cytosol and nucleus	1
3940	The four themes socioeconomic distribution of disease , decision - making in research and development , the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways , and the attribution of @DISEASE$ responsibility , ( outlined in the introduction ) , were used to guide the synthesis of the information from the literature	1
3941	For consistency , detailed discussions are limited to the findings that are directly related to the politics of epidemics , as defined in this paper .	1
3942	The induction of @GENE$ by the @GENE$ has clear parallels with @GENE$ , including the capacity to induce a ribosomal pause and the necessity for maintaining a precise distance between @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
3943	In RNA structuredependent @GENE$ , interaction of the @GENE$ with the ribosome impairs movement of the @GENE$ during translocation , destabilizing the hybrid state and elevating energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 )	1
3944	Completion of translocation is accelerated by slippage of @GENE$ into the − 1 frame , thus promoting @GENE$	1
3945	At the PRRSV signal , the bound @GENE$ would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the @GENE$ , facilitating interactions between them	1
3946	In this light , it may be significant that in pull down assays , @GENE$ has been shown to interact with @GENE$ , a protein immediately adjacent to a component ( @GENE$ ) of the putative @GENE$ - associated mRNA unwinding activity ( 13 ) and @GENE$ is known to interact with @GENE$ ( 41 ) , a @GENE$ located close to the @GENE$ entry channel	1
3947	Details of the molecular interactions that take place upon encounter of elongating ribosomes remain to be determined .	1
3948	Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online .	1
3949	Pseudocode of our Iterative HFold algorithm is available in Additional file 1	1
3950	The algorithm builds on two simpler methods , the first being our original @GENE$ algorithm [ 48 ] :	1
3951	structure , G big , we remove the minimum number of @GENE$ from the reference structure to make the reference structure pseudoknot - free	1
3952	If the reference structure is pseudoknot - free , then G big is the same as the reference structure itself	1
3953	We call the removed @GENE$ from the reference structure G small	1
3954	@GENE$ in Figure 1 represent @GENE$ of the G big structure and @GENE$ represent the @GENE$ .	1
3955	These @GENE$ - antiviral studies illustrate the search for the " perfect " @GENE$ - cargo couple , as CPP carrier efficiency is dependent on the nature of its cargo , affecting the antiviral activity	1
3956	This is particularly true for PPMO research where much effort has been put towards developing highly active peptides to outperform the more traditionally used penetratin and tat peptides [ 61 , 62 ]	1
3957	Improving @GENE$ endosomolytical properties to intensify antiviral activity of the conjugated cargo has become a main focus , as the endosomal escape appears to be critical to antiviral activity [ 30 ] .	1
3958	The closer the value of Levenshstein distance to zero , the closer are the species names .	1
3959	The poor response of symptoms to an in - vitro susceptibility guided , adequately dosed antibiotic treatment that we found , is similar to poor response findings in 2 other disease entities involving H	1
3960	influenzae as a predominant pathogen in children ; recurrent and unresponsive @DISEASE$ and protracted @DISEASE$ [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]	1
3961	In the middle ear , biofilm formation has been demonstrated to be one of the major mechanisms for persistence and provides an explanation for unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy [ 39 , 40 ]	1
3962	Moreover , biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]	1
3963	Although our study does not provide evidence of biofilm formation in the lower airways of young @DISEASE$ , our findings of poor response to and frequent relapse after a short course of antibiotic treatment are suggestive for involvement of biofilm	1
3964	Biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies , because its presence may have consequences for treatment .	1
3965	As mentioned in the introduction , there is increasing evidence for vector - free transmission of @DISEASE$ , in which oronasal , contact , or aerosol exposure to the virus has resulted in infection of various vertebrates	1
3966	The reported @DISEASE$ , all described as mosquito borne , include at least @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , and the species concerned include pigs , humans , nonhuman primates , mice , guinea pigs , hamsters , geese , partridges , ducks , several other species of birds , and even alligators ( 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 - 17 , 20 - 22 , 24 - 27 , 46 - 54 )	1
3967	Some of these reports are from experimental studies , and others are from field observations , laboratory infections , or infections of exposed health care providers or animal caretakers	1
3968	Despite this multitude of reports , nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission	1
3969	For nonlaboratory exposures , a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine	1
3970	In fact , this has been described in many of the references previously cited , but the source of virus and first target remained unknown .	1
3971	We analyzed samples that were previously screened for the presence of Bartonella by Becker et al	1
3972	[ 49 ] using nested PCR to amplify a region of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 51 ]	1
3973	Among the Bartonella - positive samples , we randomly selected 5 - 10 positive samples per site for Sanger sequencing ( n = 51 )	1
3974	@GENE$ were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits ( Zymo Research ) and sequenced in both directions at the Georgia Genomics Facility	1
3975	Resulting chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious ( Biomatters ) [ 52 ]	1
3976	Post - trimmed @GENE$ were assembled to create @GENE$ for each sample ( n = 35 ; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low ) .	1
3977	Moreover , with lower ventilation rates require the source control approach is likely to prove also more energy - efficient .	1
3978	Over 2 million disability adjusted life years ( DALY ) are annually lost in the European Union due to compromised indoor air quality , but this burden of disease can be reduced by adjusting ventilation , filtration of intake air and by controlling indoor sources	1
3979	All three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks from approximately 20 % to almost 50 % , corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000	1
3980	Amastigotes were found in blood smears and smears from nasal exudate or corneal cytology [ 50 , 57 , 63 , 66 ] .	1
3981	The main goal of analyzing the mechanism of EV - D68 pathogenesis was to identify new strategies for preventing and treating the disease , so we did additional experiments to further explore G2 / M synchronization as an approach to inhibit the replication of different EV - D68 strains	1
3982	Our results demonstrate that in addition to its effects on the EV - D68 Fermon strain , G2 / M synchronization by nocodazole inhibited the replication and virulence of US / KY / 14 - 18953 and US / MO / 14 - 18947	1
3983	Additionally , PAB , which is another agent that can induce G2 / M arrest , also significantly inhibited the production of EV - D68 and EV - A71	1
3984	Because nocodazole also has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the production of EV - A71 ( Yu et al	1
3985	, 2015 ) , medicines that induce G2 / M arrest might be considered as a common approach for inhibiting different types of @DISEASE$ , which provides a new direction for @DISEASE$ drug development .	1

4005	In this study , none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU ( n = 13 ) was a current smoker	1
4006	In contrast , three patients from the non - ICU group were current smokers , with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients ( p = 0	1

4010	Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients , of which 173 had severe symptoms , and 926 had non - severe symptoms	1
4011	Among the patients with severe symptoms , 16	1

4016	Additionally , in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation , admission to an ICU or died , 25	1
4017	5 % were current smokers and 7	1
4018	6 % were former smokers	1
4019	In contrast , in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes , only 11	1

4021	6 % were former smokers	1
4022	No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study	1
4023	Finally , Liu et al	1
4024	13 found among their population of 78 patients with @DISEASE$ that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking ( 27	1

4065	Feline viruses are of particularly opportunistic character	1
4066	In order to adapt to the solitary way of life of ancestral felids , these pathogens have acquired elaborate means to persist within their host population over the course of time	1
4067	The infection of new hosts upon the rare contact between individuals was evolutionarily assured by very efficient transmission strategies and the induction of latent , chronic and / or asymptomatic infections	1
4068	Often kept in multi - cat households and placed in catteries or shelters , today ' s domestic cat is consequently particularly susceptible to @DISEASE$ [ 1 , 2 ]	1
4069	The close proximity and high social contact rate of animals with different vaccination states in these stressful environments further increases the risk of infection	1
4070	Moreover , the strong antigenic variability of several common feline viruses including the feline calicivirus ( FCV ) , the feline coronavirus ( FCoV ) and the feline @DISEASE$ virus ( FeLV ) support escape from immune responses and lower the efficacy of currently available vaccines [ 3 ]	1
4071	The availability of complementary prophylactic strategies could help protect pet cats in environments with high infectious pressure from long diseases and / or death caused by infections with fatal viruses .	1
4072	Observing the development of resistance to DFMO and the emergence of mutants in the passaged virus , we cloned these mutations in the CVB3 parental strain using mutagenic PCR on the CVB3 infectious clone	1
4073	In addition to 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutants , we generated a @GENE$ / 3C 52R double mutant	1
4074	After confirming the presence of the mutations , we generated an infectious virus and measured the virus titer over several rounds of replication	1

4076	01	1
4077	Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay	1
4078	As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of @GENE$ mutation	1
4079	However , in DFMO - treated cells , the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer , which persisted to 72 hpi	1
4080	Interestingly , the @GENE$ , either alone or in combination , exhibited a significant rescue in viral titer compared to the wildtype virus , suggesting partial resistance to polyamine depletion .	1
4081	To determine how @GENE$ affected HIV - 1 , cell lysates and viral preparations obtained after DNA transfection and virion purification by ultracentrifugation through 25 % sucrose were analyzed by WB ( Figure 2A )	1
4082	Under these conditions , cell lysates displayed a robust expression of all @GENE$ tested	1
4083	When viruses were analyzed , no notable variations were observed in the amount of @GENE$ and @GENE$ present in the different preparations produced in the presence or absence of @GENE$ ( Figure 2A for a WB analysis and Additional file 1 : Figure S1B for a precise quantification of @GENE$ and @GENE$ by ELISA )	1
4084	Surprisingly , @GENE$ were detected in viral preparations , suggesting that they could be @GENE$	1
4085	Next , we produced HIV - 1 viral particles in the presence of a variable amount of @GENE$ by transfecting different amounts of @GENE$ for a constant amount of @GENE$	1
4086	Purified virion particles were then normalized by exo - RT and either analyzed by WB ( Figure 2B ) , or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells ( Figure 2C )	1
4087	@GENE$ were incorporated in a dose dependent manner in virion particles and the infectivity of virion particles decreased proportionally to the levels of @GENE$ incorporated , overall suggesting a dose response inhibition of @GENE$ on viral infectivity .	1
4088	We further hypothesized that @GENE$ may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication	1
4089	To this end , we treated Veros with 500 µM DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h	1
4090	Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of @GENE$ ( Figure 4C )	1
4091	In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of @GENE$ with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of @GENE$ - 2A 29K , @GENE$ , or @GENE$	1
4092	However , with DFMO treatment , @GENE$ cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A )	1
4093	When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of @GENE$ , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3	1
4094	In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 @GENE$ activity and that the @GENE$ derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity	1
4095	controls with our @GENE$ reporter system into untreated and 500 µM DFMO - treated Veros	1
4096	At 24 h , we measured @GENE$ activity and normalized to renilla @GENE$ activity and to control cells transfected with @GENE$ alone ( no @GENE$ )	1
4097	We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited @GENE$ activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B )	1
4098	Interestingly , we also observed that both @GENE$ and @GENE$ exhibited robust @GENE$ activity , even in DFMO - treated cells	1
4099	We also observed that @GENE$ exhibited higher @GENE$ activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for @GENE$ .	1
4100	The antioxidant activity of essential oils has been target of investigation due to their potential as preservatives , cosmeceuticals or nutraceuticals in the food and cosmetic industries	1
4101	The search for antiinflammatory activities in essential oils has also increased during these last years	1
4102	This work reports the antioxidant activities of essential oils which may act by preventing lipid peroxidation , scavenging free radicals or , and in very few cases , chelating metal ions	1
4103	Some works also showed that the constituents of essential oil act synergistically because their main components when used as references have less activity than the essential oil	1
4104	Therefore , synergism and antagonism studies must be developed .	1
4105	As for the ex vitro plant , the plant parts were dried in oven at 50 ∘ C until a constant weight was achieved and then were ground	1
4106	The powdered plants were then extracted by sonication for 10 min at room temperature of 25 ± 2 ∘ C using methanol as the solvent ( plant materials - solvent ratio of 1 : 5 to 1 : 10 )	1
4107	After filtration , the filtrates were dried using a rotary evaporator ( Buchi , Switzerland ) at 40 ∘ C to obtain the respective extracts	1
4108	The extracts were then kept in freezer at − 20 ∘ C prior to analysis	1
4109	Meanwhile , for in vitro plants , dried callus was then powdered using a mortar and pestle and extracted by sonication method as described above .	1

4159	To examine the effects of @GENE$ on the @GENE$ - mediated inhibition of the CSFV @GENE$ activity , the @GENE$ reporter assay was used in this study	1
4160	The results showed that @GENE$ ( Figure 5A ) , as well as @GENE$ ( Figure 5B ) , inhibited the CSFV @GENE$ activity in a dose - dependent manner	1
4161	To further investigate the inhibitory effects of @GENE$ and @GENE$ coexpression , @GENE$ were cotransfected with the @GENE$ into HEK293T cells	1
4162	The results indicated that the @GENE$ did not antagonize the inhibition of the @GENE$ activity by @GENE$ when @GENE$ and @GENE$ were coexpressed ( Figure 5C )	1

4183	Astrovirus VA1 belongs to the novel Mamastrovirus 9 species ( Astroviridae family ) and was first identified in 2009 in human stools during an outbreak of @DISEASE$	1
4184	[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Its prevalence in stools ranges from 0	1
4185	2 % to 1	1
4186	6 % in @DISEASE$ subjects worldwide	1
4187	[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Furthermore , astrovirus VA1 has been identified in brain biopsies of @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$ , 9 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] but it has never been documented in respiratory specimens until now	1
4188	Current molecular diagnostic assays used in most routine laboratories target only the classical HAstV 1 - 8 serotypes , which belong to the Mamastrovirus 1 species ; yet , astrovirus VA1 cannot be diagnosed because it shares only a 46 % nucleotide sequence identity with the full genome of HAstV - 1	1
4189	This is particularly unfortunate , as a recent investigation of healthy adult blood donors in the United States showed that 65 % of the samples were seropositive	1
4190	14 In terms of public health relevance , there is increasing evidence that astrovirus VA1 and other novel HAstVs recently described worldwide ( i	1

4192	, astrovirus VA1 - 5 and MLB1 - 3 15 ) may be of importance in routine diagnostics , particularly in @DISEASE$ patients	1

4201	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were transfected into HeLa cells using Fugene HD transfection reagents ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) and selected by G418 selection ( 400 mg / ml )	1
4202	The relative concentrations of @GENE$ and @GENE$ were calculated by quantitative real - time PCR after normalization to the @GENE$ ( Table 2	1

4207	The 3D8 scFv TG founder ( F 0 lines ) was mated with wild - type C57BL / 6NCrjBgi to establish the lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines	1
4208	Four F 1 lines ( 69 F 1 : 31 , 33 , 38 , 208 ) were produced from the F 0 69 lines	1
4209	Each of the four F 1 69 lines were mated with wild - type C57BL / 6NCrjBgi and then 20 F 2 69 lines were produced	1
4210	They were used for virus challenge experiments and named @GENE$	1
4211	In the case of the 90 and 135 F 1 lines , three F 1 90 lines ( F 1 90 : 45 , 46 , and 162 ) and five F 1 135 lines ( F 1 135 : 140 , 142 , 144 , 165 , and 166 ) were produced and then 17 F 2 90 lines ( STG90 ) and 24 F 2 135 lines ( STG135 ) were prepared ( Figure S4A )	1
4212	Genomic PCR was performed to confirm the transgenic lines at each generation from F 0 to F 2 ( data not shown ) .	1
4213	ROS and RNS are generated in phagocytes in order to neutralise the invading organisms , having therefore an important role in the host defence mechanism	1
4214	Nevertheless , their overproduction may be responsible for damage at inflammatory sites	1
4215	In addition these reactive species play important roles in inflammation by being trigger elements or by being @GENE$	1
4216	ROS and RNS act as modulators of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which regulate the expression of key @GENE$ [ 22 ]	1

4220	There remains a pressing need , however , to engage the citizenry more fully in the process of preparedness planning in order to ensure that the plans reflect the common will and that the policies serve the common good [ 29 ]	1
4221	In this regard , the continuing growth in interest and activity in the subfield of public health ethics is certainly welcome and holds greats promise .	1
4222	Data on public attitudes toward quarantine in the wake of SARS are scarce	1
4223	Public opinion polls have indicated high levels of acceptance of quarantine among samples of Toronto - area residents ( 97 % ) and US citizens ( 93 % ) [ 20 ]	1
4224	These findings are supported by an observed non - compliance rate of only 0	1
4225	1 % among Torontonians requiring quarantine during SARS [ 11 ]	1
4226	A qualitative study of factors influencing compliance with quarantine in Toronto identified ' protection of the health of the community ' as a prominent motivating factor	1
4227	The authors of the study concluded that " while the overall compliance rate among residents of the GTA appears to have been high , the influence of ' civic duty ' and social responsibility may not be as significant in other countries and cultures " [ 21 ] .	1
4228	This paper has discussed the challenges and facilitators to addressing @DISEASE$ in a well - resourced setting such as Singapore	1
4229	Despite Singapore having an established One Health platform representing all the different stakeholders ; appropriate funding to address the response ; existence of stewardship and surveillance programs in public hospitals ; an active program in research ; and a motivated workforce ; most participants raised several challenges to address @DISEASE$ efficiently	1
4230	These included , among other , vested interests among some stakeholders ; disagreements between the human and animal health sectors ; low public awareness ; the need to address prevention of @DISEASE$ in the animal and environmental sector ; political and cultural aspects influencing @DISEASE$ ; and lax stewardship policies in the private sector .	1

4233	@GENE$ signaling is essential for the development of mononuclear phagocytes including microglia , but pharmacological antagonism has been reported to selectively deplete microglia [ 48 ]	1
4234	To examine the impact of @GENE$ antagonism on both peripheral and CNS mononuclear cells , we used PLX5622 , which reportedly depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [ 37 , 41 ]	1
4235	Mice were provided either control chow or PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , after which microglia numbers were assessed by flow cytometry using the microglia - specific marker @GENE$ ( Additional file 1 ) and by immunohistochemistry using @GENE$ ( Additional file 2 )	1
4236	Quantification shows that 2 weeks of PLX5622 treatment reduced microglia in the CNS by 90 - 95 % ( Additional file 1 A - F , P , Q )	1
4237	Specificity of @GENE$ for CNS - resident microglia is demonstrated by lack of staining in leukocytes isolated from peripheral immune compartments ( Additional file 1 G - O )	1
4238	Within the CNS , PLX5622 treatment significantly depleted microglia across hippocampal , cortical , and cerebellar brain regions ( Additional file 2 )	1
4239	To determine whether PLX5622 treatment depleted mononuclear cells in peripheral immune compartments , we assessed numbers of antigen - presenting cells ( APCs , Fig	1
4240	1 ) and T cells ( Additional file 3 ) in the spleen and blood of uninfected mice in control versus PLX5622 - treated mice	1
4241	PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced circulating CD11c + ( Fig	1
4242	1a - c ) , MHCII + CD11c + ( Fig	1
4243	1d - f ) , and CD11b neg CD11c + ( Fig	1
4244	1g - i ) cells in the blood	1
4245	In the spleen , however , there was no significant difference in populations of APCs with PLX5622 treatment ( Fig	1

4247	@DISEASE$ is the leading cause of death among children less than 5 years old worldwide	1
4248	A wide range of viral , bacterial and fungal agents can cause @DISEASE$ : although viruses are the most common etiologic agent , the severity of clinical symptoms associated with @DISEASE$ and increasing antibiotic resistance makes @DISEASE$ a major public health concern	1
4249	@DISEASE$ can follow @DISEASE$ and complicate @DISEASE$	1
4250	Secondary @DISEASE$ is a major cause of @DISEASE$ - related deaths	1
4251	In this review , we evaluate the following hypotheses : ( i ) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of @DISEASE$ by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract ( URT ) and ( ii ) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT	1
4252	We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions	1
4253	We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT	1
4254	However , it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in @DISEASE$ etiology	1
4255	The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co - infection , increased carriage and @DISEASE$ has been established	1

4263	The search was performed using @GENE$ as a specific enzyme	1
4264	A maximum of one missed cleavage was permitted and oxidation ( M ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were selected as variable modifications	1

4267	Protein ratios were normalized using the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample for each separate ratio in every individual experiment	1
4268	The ratio for a given protein was calculated by taking the average of all the peptide ratios that Briefly , the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; dilution , 1 : 2 , 000 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , @GENE$ ( sc - 21757 ; dilution , 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc	1

4270	After washing , the membranes were incubated with @GENE$ and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( ECL ; Forevergen , Guangzhou , China ) .	1
4271	Tissues ( duodenum , jejunum , colon , liver , spleen , kidney , mesenteric lymph node , heart , lung , pancreas , brain and / or bone marrow ) from 11 representative Australian @DISEASE$ cases that had died or been euthanised , ranging in age from 8 weeks to 12 months , including one from Melbourne in 2014 and 10 from Sydney in 2017 and 2018 , were available for histological examination	1
4272	Tissues ( intestine , + / − mesenteric lymph node ) from six suspected cases of @DISEASE$ from New Zealand were also examined	1
4273	All tissues were collected post - mortem and animals were not euthanised for the purposes of this study .	1
4274	To date , the absence of preventive strategy for HCV reinfection after transplant is a major challenge for the @DISEASE$ recipients undergoing LT	1
4275	As mentioned above , reinfection of the liver graft is universal and characterized by accelerated progression of @DISEASE$	1
4276	Furthermore , treatment of recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT is compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies	1
4277	In addition , poor outcome after graft reinfection of HCV has increasingly become a major problem faced by the hepatologists and transplant surgeons	1
4278	Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic strategies of @DISEASE$ reinfection are urgently needed .	1
4279	The prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) test was performed to evaluate sensorimotor integration by measuring the startle response to administered acoustic pulses , however , no significant differences were detected among the groups ( Fig	1

4283	The association between human @DISEASE$ and occupational exposures to pigs or pork has been reported in Europe and Asia since 1968 [ 6 , 15 , 16 ]	1
4284	In Vietnam , the proportion of patients reported to have occupational exposures was lower than reported in European patients but it remained an important independent risk factor	1
4285	Slaughtering and processing sick or dead pigs were also associated with @DISEASE$ in a case - control study conducted during the Sichuan outbreak [ 13 ] .	1
4286	The process of isolating infected individuals results in a reduction in the mean infectious period ( see Protocol S1 )	1
4287	It is much more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed because it essentially truncates the tail of the distribution , so that the infectious period of a few individuals is dramatically reduced	1
4288	This effect is not as pronounced in the gamma - distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods ( see Figure 1A )	1
4289	In the same way , a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model because during this time many individuals will have naturally left the infectious class	1
4290	Under the assumption of a gamma - distributed infectious period most individuals are infectious for a minimum period of time so early detection is ( C ) We plot the incidence data along with the @GENE$ best fit ( m ¼ 2 , n ¼ 2 ) and that obtained by ignoring any latent period ( n ¼ 1 ) - the @GENE$ best fit	1
4291	( D ) The best - fit estimate of R 0 changes for these two models as we increase the number of points used in the fitting procedure	1
4292	When fitting the models , for each value of n ( and m ) , we are estimating the average infectious period , 1 / c , and transmission parameter , b ( and average latent period , 1 / r )	1

4299	While the predicted difference between the exponential and gamma - distributed models depends on the duration of the infectious period and the fraction of contacts traced , it is generally true that models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will give rise to overly optimistic predictions concerning the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals .	1

4316	We have used the new Quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics using different algorithms	1
4317	Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 show these workflows for distance - based algorithms , maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms , respectively	1
4318	The workflows use ClustalW [ 10 ] to compute @GENE$ and different phylogenetic algorithms from the PHYLIP package [ 4 ] .	1
4319	In the inflammatory response there is an increase of permeability of endothelial lining cells and influxes of blood leukocytes into the interstitium , oxidative burst , and release of @GENE$ [ @GENE$ and @GENE$ - @GENE$ - α ) ]	1

4325	As a control , cells were either trans@GENE$ ed with GFP dsRNA ( Control )	1
4326	The results ( Fig 5C ) showed cells infected with @DISEASE$@GENE$  decreased CxSTAT levels , which returned to baseline in cells transfected w@GENE$ NA against CxCul4	1
4327	Although , we cannot rule out the possibility that reduc@GENE$ adati@GENE$ xSTAT upon CxCul4 knockdown is due to lower virus replication , these results combined with other data indicate that @DISEASE$ infection @GENE$ o de@GENE$ on of CxSTAT via CxCul4 .	1
4328	Nurses play a vital role in the hospital of caring for patients	1
4329	They are the core members of the hospital who produce good and quality results	1
4330	Therefore , it is important for the hospital CEO and nursing unit managers to support them in order for them to remain productive	1
4331	The hospitals should make sure that they order quality equipment , and other materials to assist nurses to do their work effectively	1
4332	Nurses should be provided with adequate and necessary training to empower them with relevant skills and knowledge	1
4333	Good management empowers employees in the hospital in different ways and also listens to their requests	1
4334	Below are the comments made by the participants : Nurse ( N5 ) said : " Hmmm , we believe that for now we just need special support from the management and all @DISEASE$ programme managers , to empower us with knowledge maybe by having workshops with us or arranging in - service training	1
4335	It is crucial that we gain more knowledge on how to communicate with patients who are showing side effects or who are likely to default when they are at home	1
4336	I believe that if we can be empowered with knowledge , the death rate and the spread of disease can be reduced	1
4337	"	1
4338	As mentioned in Section ' Background ' , in the literature on hierarchical folding , there are reports of counter examples to the hierarchical folding hypothesis where bases that are initially part of the pseudoknot - free structure for a molecule later change as the @GENE$ forms	1
4339	This motivates a comparison of HFold versus Iterative HFold , in order to see how a method that sticks strictly with the hypothesis ( i	1
4340	e	1
4341	, HFold ) compares with a method that allows for some base changes ( i	1
4342	e	1
4343	, Iterative HFold )	1

4348	In Section ' Accuracy comparison with existing methods ' we compare Iterative @GENE$ - the method that performs best overall in Sections ' Robustness comparison ' and ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of @GENE$ ' with existing methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction	1

4351	Method 3 : First run @GENE$ on S and G to obtain result G - a pseudoknot - free structure that contains @GENE$	1
4352	Then let G updated be the @GENE$ of @GENE$ containing the @GENE$ of @GENE$ that include the @GENE$ of @GENE$	1

4373	Finally , we evaluated whether rVV - N25 treatment affected the number of macrophages , @GENE$ production by macrophages , or both ; specifically , we isolated IHLs from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 7 days after immunization with rVV - N25 or with LC16m8	1
4374	The percentage of macrophages ( CD11b + F4 / 80 + ) among IHLs and @GENE$ production from these macrophages were significantly lower in rVV - N25 - treated mice than in control mice ( Figure 6G )	1
4375	Though the percentage of TNF - a - producing macrophages was not significantly different in rVV - N25 - treated and control mice ( P = 0	1
4376	099 ) , rVV - N25 treatment appeared to suppress these macrophages	1
4377	These results demonstrated that rVV - N25 had a suppressive effect on activated macrophages , and they indicated that this suppression ameliorated the histological indicators of @DISEASE$ .	1
4378	The pBR322 - based plasmid vector @GENE$ contained the @GENE$ within the @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ virus , which was reconstructed from the@GENE$  and@GENE$  [ 41 , 42 ]	1
4379	Separate@GENE$  encoding either the@GENE$  ,@GENE$  , or all@GENE$  were cloned from@GENE$  by RT - PCR	1
4380	Each@GENE$  was inserted into a separate@GENE$  downstream of the@GENE$  ; the final designation of each@GENE$  was@GENE$  ,@GENE$  , or@GENE$  ( Figure 2 )	1
4381	They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 ( multiplicity of infection = 10 )	1
4382	The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping ; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use	1
4383	The hemagglutinin - negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [ 42 ] and named rVV - CN2 ,@GENE$  , or@GENE$ 	1
4384	Insertion of the@GENE$  into the@GENE$  was confirmed by direct PCR , and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis	1
4385	The titers of@GENE$  ,@GENE$  , and@GENE$  were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells .	1
4386	All data used for this project are publicly available and accessible online ( GN accession no	1
4387	GN160 ) .	1
4388	None of the birds from the control group showed significant macroscopic changes in any of the examined organs	1
4389	Irrespective of the sampling time , we did not record any lesion in the lungs , kidneys , and brains of birds in the H9 - group , while the spleens appeared slightly enlarged in all of the subjects , on days 4 and 6 pi .	1
4390	qRRT - PCR positive samples were further titrated to evaluate the infectivity of the virus	1
4391	On days 4 and 6 pi , we recorded positive TCID 50 values in the oviduct of 43 % of the birds , while the organs of the respiratory and digestive tracts were positive in 50 % and 25 % of the birds respectively , only on day 4 pi ( Table 1 and Figure 2 )	1
4392	We did not observe cytopathic effects culturing kidney , brain and spleen samples .	1
4393	The @GENE$ of HEV has traditionally been believed to associate with @GENE$ , multimerize and form the viral capsid	1
4394	No other function of @GENE$ has yet been reported	1
4395	In this article , we present evidence which suggest that the @GENE$ protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle	1
4396	The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments	1
4397	First , @GENE$ was capable of directly interacting with the F - box protein @GENE$ , both in vitro and in vivo	1
4398	Second , Δ35 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , was also capable of inhibiting @GENE$ activity , thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact	1
4399	Third , @GENE$ of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments .	1

4408	In the current study , we demonstrated that G0 / G1 phase arrest was required by EV - D68 production ; however , in a previous study , EV - A71 was shown to have the opposite effect ( Yu et al	1
4409	, 2015 )	1
4410	This difference is surprising given that both EV - A71 and EV - D68 belong to the Picornaviridae family	1
4411	To further confirm the different activities between the two viruses , we analyzed them side by side , and our results confirm that G0 / G1 synchronization promotes EV - D68 viral production but inhibits EV - A71 viral production	1
4412	Therefore , EV - D68 an EV - A71 can both manipulate the host cell cycle , but the process and outcomes of cell cycle manipulation are entirely different , which could explain why EV - D68 and EV - A71 have varying characteristics , such as the epidemic region ( Europe and Asia ) , the clinical symptoms , and the epidemic size	1
4413	Meanwhile , these results serve as a reminder that different @DISEASE$ may require different therapeutic treatments targeting a different set of host@GENE$ fortunately , the reason of the difference between them is not clear , but it is speculated that some a host@GENE$ ) generated or kept high level in G0 / G1 phase was required by EV - D68 production , while EV - A71 required some a host@GENE$ ) generated or kept high level in S phase so that their non - structural 3D were obligated by two viruses to regulate host cell cycle for their own replication .	1
4414	To further understand the mechanism of EV - D68 manipulation of the host cell cycle , we assessed whether EV - D68 could regulate cell cycle exit from G0 / G1 into S phase	1
4415	@DISEASE$ cells were synchronized in G0 / G1 by serum starvation for 24 h , and then mock - infected or infected with EV - D68 Fermon strain for 2 h	1
4416	The cells were then stimulated with 10 % FBS in order to trigger cell cycle re - entry into S phase from G0 / G1	1
4417	At 24 h of mitogenic stimulation with serum , the mock - infected cells progressed synchronously from G0 / G1 into S phase	1
4418	In contrast , the majority of the EV - D68 - infected @DISEASE$ cells remained in G0 / G1 phase over the 24 h time period without S entry ( P < 0	1
4419	001 ; Figure 3A )	1
4420	Therefore , these results support a model in which EV - D68 infection regulates the cell cycle by preventing entry into the S phase .	1
4421	Medical writing support was provided by Scidra Consulting , INC and was funded by the authors .	1
4422	The model presented in this paper uses a weighted static network to simulate the risk of transmission between livestock farms	1
4423	Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models , and previous work indicates that they provide good prediction of mean epidemic sizes , though may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks [ 38 ]	1
4424	The advantage with a weighted static network approach is that it is possible to determine the epidemic impact independent of time of year	1
4425	However , there is clear seasonality observed in the cattle movement network [ 49 ] , and it is therefore possible that a weighted static network could result in an under - or over - prediction of epidemic size	1
4426	Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the preferred sampling strategies are robust , although the proportion of nodes that need to be sampled may vary dependent upon time of year	1

4443	In a short report , Chainy et al	1
4444	( 2000 ) [ 148 ] described that anethole , eugenol and isoeugenol inhibited @GENE$ - induced @GENE$ activation in ML1 - a cells	1
4445	The same authors also reported that anethole inhibited the degradation of @GENE$ , blocking its phosphorylation in TNF - stimulated ML1 - a cells	1
4446	In the same cells and with @GENE$ stimulation , anethole did not induce the phosphorylation of @GENE$	1
4447	Besides @GENE$ and @GENE$ , anethole also blocked @GENE$ and @GENE$ .	1
4448	Meanings were formulated from the significant statements .	1
4449	As a feature of their pathogenic mechanism , many viruses facilitate their own replication by interacting with @GENE$ that regulate cell cycle progression	1
4450	Examples can be discovered in DNA viruses , retroviruses and RNA viruses	1
4451	DNA viruses , which replicate in the nucleus , have been extensively investigated in regard to control the cell cycle of host cells	1
4452	For example , some small DNA viruses including simian virus 40 ( DeCaprio et al	1
4453	, 1988 ) , adenovirus ( Howe et al	1
4454	, 1990 ; Eckner et al	1
4455	, 1994 ) , and human papillomavirus ( Werness et al	1
4456	, 1990 ) , which lack their own @GENE$ , use the host @GENE$ to promote the entry of cells into S phase from G0 / G1 phase	1
4457	For other large DNA viruses , for example , herpesviruses can induce G0 / G1 arrest in order to avoid competing for cellular DNA replication resources ( Flemington , 2001 )	1
4458	Cell cycle regulation also has been observed for retroviruses , which , like DNA viruses , replicate in the nucleus	1
4459	The @GENE$ of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for eliciting cell cycle arrest in G2 / M phase ( He et al	1
4460	, 1995 ; Goh et al	1
4461	, 1998 )	1
4462	Furthermore , RNA viruses , whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm , have also been demonstrated to interfere with the host cell cycle	1
4463	@DISEASE$ ( IBV ) induces an S and G2 / M - phase arrest to favor viral replication ( Dove et al	1
4464	, 2006 ; Li et al	1
4465	, 2007 ) , and mouse @DISEASE$ virus ( MHV ) ( Chen and Makino , 2004 ) and some severe @DISEASE$ c@GENE$ n G0 / G1 phase ( Yuan et al	1
4466	, 2005 ( Yuan et al	1
4467	, , 2006	1
4468	In a previous study , we found that human EV - A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 , manipulate the host cell cycle at S phase in order to promote their own viral replication ( Yu et al	1
4469	, 2015 ) ; however , the potential manipulation of the host cell cycle by EV - D68 , which is associated with higher lethality in recent large - scale outbreaks , has not been previously characterized .	1
4470	Construction of double antigen sandwich - lateral flow immunoassay ( DAS - LFIA ) strip and indirect lateral flow immunoassay ( I - LFIA )	1
4471	The DAS - LFIA device for the detection of @GENE$ was manufactured by Artron BioResearch Inc	1
4472	First , we optimized the conditions for the colloidal gold conjugation of the @GENE$ and the coating of the @GENE$ on non - woven fabric sheets	1
4473	Colloidal gold is used as an indicator for the presence of antigens binding to the membrane on the rapid lateral flow test strip	1
4474	After the proteins are bound to colloidal gold to form the conjugate , the fabric sheets are placed in a dry room for at least 2 h for drying	1
4475	Subsequently , the @GENE$ , diluted in PBS , is coated on the test region	1
4476	Simultaneously , @GENE$ , diluted in PBS , is coated on the control region	1
4477	The coated membrane is dried for a minimum of 24 h and then blocked with a particular blocking solution	1
4478	Finally , the test strip is assembled such that everything slightly overlaps in order to allow for the continuous lateral flow of the liquid sample	1
4479	The test strip has an absorption pad , a strip of membrane , a conjugate fibre and other fibres to hold the conjugate fibre in place	1
4480	Instructions on how to assemble a test strip were provided by Artron BioResearch Inc	1
4481	The combination of the @GENE$ , @GENE$ , conjugate fibre and dialysis buffer forms a ' system ' in a test strip	1
4482	The test strip developed was tested with different positive and negative HCV sera	1
4483	@GENE$ was manufactured using @GENE$ conjugating colloidal gold instead of @GENE$ .	1
4484	All serum samples were screened in triplicate at a dilution of 1 : 20	1
4485	A specimen was considered as screening positive if the average of the three wells containing the sera exhibited a > 50 % reduction in luminescence in comparison to the luminescence negative ( BSA ) or no serum control	1
4486	Thirteen sera ( 9 animal exposed and 4 controls ) screened positive at 1 : 20 , but upon titration of these sera in subsequent assays , none of them were reproducibly able to neutralize the MERS - CoV pseudotyped lentiviral vector at a serum dilution of 1 : 20 .	1
4487	In this study , we used a systems - genetics approach to conduct complex trait analysis and uncover @GENE$ in the pulmonary myocardium in situ ( Chesler et al	1
4488	2005 ; Sieberts and Schadt 2007 )	1
4489	Systems - genetics approaches use genetic reference populations such as the BXD resource , a set of recombinant inbred mice which are the progeny of an intercross between the two parental mouse strains C57BL / 6J and DBA / 2J ( Andreux et al	1
4490	2012 ; Peirce et al	1
4491	2004 )	1
4492	Recombinant inbred strains like the BXD and the Collaborative Cross ( Ram et al	1
4493	2014 ; Threadgill et al	1
4494	2011 ) are especially suited for systems - genetics studies because each strain is effectively immortal ( Andreux et al	1
4495	2012 )	1
4496	They provide a powerful test bed for linking @GENE$ loci to variation , including mapping loci controlling gene expression levels	1
4497	Such loci are termed @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( Chesler et al	1
4498	2005 )	1
4499	Importantly , analyses of @GENE$ provide a means for detecting specific regulators of a gene of interest as well as identification of networks of @GENE$ ( Andreux et al	1
4500	2012 ; Hall et al	1
4501	2014 ) .	1
4502	A study done by Sohayati et al	1
4503	[ 41 ] , done on captive large flying foxes ( also known as Malayan flying fox ; Pteropus vampyrus ) , showed the possibility of recrudescence of @DISEASE$ ( NiV )	1
4504	Regular sampling was done for over a period of one year to study the presence of virus and level of antibody against it	1
4505	The authors discovered that one bat had a waning antibody titer with subsequent detection of virus in the urine	1
4506	Following virus shedding , the antibody levels increased in this animal	1
4507	As virus was undetectable in earlier samples of the same bat , the authors suggest that the virus may have persisted , probably in certain organs or cells , rendering it undetectable in blood , throat swab or urine	1
4508	Within two weeks after NiV was isolated from the bat , two other male bats seroconverted and demonstrated an increase in antibody titers , suggesting that recrudescence led to horizontal transmission .	1
4509	The mechanism for the induction of autophagy was not determined , although it was shown not to be by induction of ER stress , @GENE$ inhibition or via @GENE$	1
4510	In addition , it was not confirmed whether @GENE$ was responsible for the induction of autophagy in virus infected cells	1
4511	However , in agreement with previous work , virus infection was not inhibited by the knockdown of @GENE$ expression [ 55 ] .	1
4512	The RAST ( Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology ) [ 23 ] service provides access to high - throughput , high - quality annotation of @GENE$ , and routinely processes , 25 - 75 genomes a day , with peak throughputs that have exceeded 200 genomes per day	1
4513	This service is accessible for individual genome submission via a graphical web interface , and the next generation @GENE$ servers provide new access for programmatic batch submission of genomes via the @GENE$ submission and retrieval server	1
4514	This server supports programmatic submission of genomes to the @GENE$ Server , retrieval of job status , and retrieval of the final set of annotations	1
4515	These scripts and the underlying application programming interface ( API ) enable users to submit genomes to the @GENE$ Server , test the status of submitted jobs , and retrieve the output ( i	1
4516	e	1
4517	, @GENE$ ) .	1
4518	The data of interest consist of daily counts of ED visits and chest radiographs taken between January 1st , 2003 and September 9th , 2004 , in five metropolitan children ' s hospitals in the Midwest of the USA ( Minneapolis / St	1
4519	Paul , Milwaukee , Chicago , Akron , and Columbus ) , supplemented with time series of daily average temperature , obtained from the Average Daily Temperature Archive at The University of Dayton [ 15 ]	1
4520	These series are shown in Figure 1	1
4521	There seems to be strong seasonal component in the chest radiograph and visit series , for all the cities , which is negatively correlated with temperature	1
4522	Although it could be argued that we do not have enough years of data to prove this empirically , it is expected that a higher number of @DISEASE$ is associated with colder temperatures .	1
4523	@DISEASE$ ( Amaryllidaceae ) , known locally as " Melong kecil , " is an ornamental and bulbous perennial herb	1
4524	It has been traditionally used in Philippines as a vulnerary [ 1 ]	1
4525	Plants in the Amaryllidaceae family were reported to contain alkaloids that are known to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities [ 2 ]	1
4526	A number of alkaloids were isolated from the @DISEASE$ such as lycorine , littoraline , hippeastrine , lycorenine , tazettine , pretazettine , macronine , homolycorine , lycoramine , vittatine , and haemanthamine [ 3 ]	1
4527	These compounds were reported to possess various pharmacological effects such as antiviral , antiparasitic , anticancer , antibacterial , antioxidant , and wound healing [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] .	1
4528	The @GENE$ of @GENE$ was shown to be critical for the NS5A @GENE$ interaction , implying that it may be a potential target of anti - CSFV strategies	1
4529	We also showed that @GENE$ was able to bind to the @GENE$ located in the @GENE$ and inhibit its activity	1
4530	In addition , we investigated the effects of @GENE$ on the inhibition of the @GENE$ activity by @GENE$ ; however , we demonstrated that @GENE$ did not antagonize the inhibition of the @GENE$ activity by @GENE$ , indicating that @GENE$ and @GENE$ perhaps bind to distinct parts of the @GENE$ .	1
4531	The minimum incidence of @DISEASE$ - associated PICU admissions per 100 , 000 children < 17 years of age was calculated for each season based on the observed number of @DISEASE$ PICU patients with a residential address in Bavaria	1
4532	To correct for non - participating PICUs , the estimates of the total number of @DISEASE$ cases treated in all eligible PICUs in Bavaria per season were derived taking into account the annual percentage of participating PICUs	1
4533	The annual study population was used as denominator .	1
4534	Data represent the mean ± SEM and were plotted using Graphpad prism 5	1
4535	0 software ( Graphpad Software Inc	1
4536	, La Jolla , CA , USA )	1
4537	Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann - Whitney test , Dunn ' s multiple comparison test , and ANOVA with Bonferroni post - test	1
4538	p - Values < 0	1
4539	05 were considered statistically significant .	1
4540	These data indicate that virus multiplication was not inhibited by the @GENE$ if virus infection was not protected against in the early infection stages by the @GENE$	1
4541	This also indicates that PRV DNA was hydrolyzed immediately in virusinoculated STG90 muscle cells , and that the virus titer was not high enough to infect muscle cells	1
4542	Therefore , PRV could not move systemically into the spinal cord or brain in STG90 mice	1
4543	However , STG135 mice were not protected against @DISEASE$ infection even t@GENE$ otein was expressed in the brain ( Figure 7A ) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice	1
4544	We interpret these data to indicate that the expression and presen@GENE$ teins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues	1
4545	Blood biochemistry ( Table 1 ) and body weight changes for 7 weeks after birth ( Figure S5A and S5B ) were not significantly different between STG90 and WT mice	1
4546	Also , we identified the expression patter@GENE$ genes incl@GENE$ to@GENE$ - ra@GENE$ d BA@GENE$ F ) @GENE$ genes between STG90 and wild - type mice ; however , there was no difference ( Figure S5C ) .	1
4547	If essential oils are able to scavenge some free radicals , they can also act as anti - inflammatory agents , because one of the inflammatory responses is the oxidative burst that occurs in diverse cells ( monocytes , neutrophils , eosinophils , and macrophages )	1
4548	Phagocytosis of bacteria , which occurs during inflammation , is accompanied by a dramatic increase in oxygen consumption resulting in the formation of superoxide anion radical ( O 2	1
4549	In programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshifting ( − 1 @GENE$ ) , mRNA signals induce a proportion of translating ribosomes to slip back by 1 nucleotide ( nt ) into an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and to continue translation , al - lowing the coordinated expression of two or more proteins from a single @GENE$ ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 )	1
4550	First described as the mechanism by which the @GENE$ of the retrovirus @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) is expressed from overlappi@GENE$ elated − 1 PRF signa@GENE$ ave been documented in many other viruses of clinical , veterinary and agricultural importance ( reviewed in Ref	1

4552	PRF has a@GENE$ been increasingly recognized in conventio@GENE$ rokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicati@GENE$  insertion@GENE$ poso@GENE$  .	1
4553	Similar scenarios were seen in the secretion of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the brainstem , spinal cord , and muscle	1
4554	Elevated @GENE$ ( muscle ) , @GENE$ ( brainstem , spinal cord , and muscle ) , and @GENE$ ( brainstem and muscle ) responding to the innate immunity against @DISEASE$ infection were downregulated in transgenic mice that received N3 after infection in contrast to non - treated or isotype antibody - treated mice ( Fig	1
4555	8 )	1
4556	Expression@GENE$ - a in three tissues @GENE$  1b in the brainstem and muscle of transgenic mice were also suppressed significantly ( Fig	1
4557	9 )	1
4558	These results indicate that N3 protects mice from developing pathogenesis caused by @DISEASE$ infection	1
4559	Administration of N3 did not Protect hSCARB2 - transgenic Mice from Coxsackie Virus A16 Infection	1
4560	Following this , the peptides within the V8 and H8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the T cell epitope specificities	1
4561	We subdivided the peptides from H8 and V8 in four new pools each containing five peptides ( H8	1
4562	1 , H8	1
4563	2 , @GENE$ 1 , @GENE$	1
4564	2 )	1
4565	In addition , we separately tested the two 15mer peptides # 89 and # 90 , which were shared between pools H8 and V8	1
4566	We again vaccinated BALB / c mice with MVA - MERS - N using i	1

4577	Stimulation with peptides from pools @GENE$ or @GENE$ activated only minor levels of IFN - γ producing cells with mean levels about 23 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes	1
4578	Yet , the stimulation with subpools @GENE$	1
4579	2 and @GENE$ 2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated T cells with 83 - 176 IFN - γ SFC / 10 6 splenocytes	1
4580	Comparable numbers of IFN - γ producing cells were again induced by i	1

4584	immunization	1
4585	Of note , the stimulations with the 15 - mer peptides # 89 ( N353 - 367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK ) or # 90 ( N357 - 371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP ) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of IFN - γ producing cells ( mean levels about 71 - 107 SFC / 10 6 splenocytes ) in mice that had been vaccinated with MVA - MERS - N by both immunization routes ( Figure 4b )	1
4586	CD8 + T cells purified from mice receiving non - recombinant MVA or mock vaccine ( PBS ) did not produce @GENE$ following stimulation with peptides from subpools @GENE$ 1 - H8	1
4587	2 and with peptides # 89 and # 90	1
4588	When checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools , we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides # 89 and # 90 were part of the subpools V8	1
4589	2 and H8	1
4590	2 , whereas these peptides were absent in V8	1
4591	1 and H8	1
4592	1	1
4593	This data suggested that the overlapping 15 - mer peptides # 89 and # 90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS - CoV N - specific CD8 + T cell responses .	1
4594	Also , the figures appear to be quite pixelated and may not be in an appropriate format for publication .	1
4595	In order to investigate social behaviors , we evaluated sociability and preference for social novelty in the three - chambered social test	1
4596	During the habituation phase , the mice in each group spent equal amounts of time exploring both compartments , with no biased preference for either of the two empty cylinders ( data not shown )	1
4597	During the sociability phase , the mice in each group demonstrated a preference for spending more time in the chamber containing an unfamiliar mouse ( stranger 1 ) relative to the opposite , empty chamber	1
4598	However , the LPS - treated offspring approached the chamber containing stranger 1 significantly less frequently than the Control and HW + LPS groups ( p < 0	1
4599	001 and p < 0	1
4600	01 , respectively ; Fig	1
4601	2C )	1
4602	During the social novelty preference phase , the mice in each group showed a significant preference for the new , unfamiliar mouse ( stranger 2 ) over the previous , now familiar , mouse ( stranger 1 )	1
4603	However , the LPS - treated offspring approached the chamber containing the stranger 2 significantly less frequently than the Control group ( p < 0	1
4604	01 ; Fig	1
4605	2D )	1
4606	There was no difference between the LPS and the HW + LPS groups , although a trend toward attenuation of the LPS - induced reduction in the preference for social novelty was detected in the HW + LPS group .	1
4607	The research question posed by the paper is important and I believe the methods used are appropriate to answer it	1
4608	However , the aims of the paper are not currently well stated ( in both the main text and in the abstract )	1
4609	The main statement of the aims comes towards the end of page 5 , which states " This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements "	1
4610	This doesn ' t really capture what the authors have actually done	1
4611	There is a slightly better statement of the aims hidden in the Methods ( top of page 7 ) but even this doesn ' t quite feel sufficient .	1
4612	The ' Search ' menu allows the user to look in the database for a specific protein or virus order , family , subfamily , genus , species or common name	1
4613	Uniprot identifiers can also be used in the search function .	1
4614	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , a frequently fatal disease of cats , is caused by feline parvovirus ( @DISEASE$ ) or @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
4615	We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of @DISEASE$ between 2014 and 2018 in Australia , New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) where @DISEASE$ outbreaks had not been reported for several decades	1
4616	Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved	1
4617	Most cats with @DISEASE$ were shelter - housed , 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis , unvaccinated , had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines	1
4618	Analys@GENE$ f parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all @DISEASE$ cases were caused by @DISEASE$ and not @DISEASE$	1
4619	Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct @DISEASE$ , with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations	1
4620	Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin	1
4621	@DISEASE$ vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases , highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co - incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats	1
4622	Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter - housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks , likely precipitating the multiple re - emergence of infection events .	1
4623	We observed that the mean age of @DISEASE$ patients was significantly higher than the age of patients with @DISEASE$ caused by other bacteria , and that high age was associated with increased risk of infection with S	1
4624	suis	1
4625	In contrast , pediatric infections with S	1
4626	suis are extremely rare , presumably related to a lack of exposure associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$ , in children .	1

4633	It was shown that the prevalence of @DISEASE$ was higher on farms that fed weaned piglets only twice a day with a restricted amount of feed than on farms that provided more than two meals per day with or without feed restriction [ 38 ]	1
4634	In addition , Amezuca et al	1
4635	[ 43 ] reported that the occurrence of @DISEASE$ was greater with pelleted feed and inadequate feeder space per piglet in the pen .	1
4636	Reads from the @GENE$ were concatenated and consensus data from 454 and Illumina sequencing were compared ( Fig	1
4637	S7 ) Figure 5 ) .	1
4638	The homeostasis of eukaryotic cells is maintained by a well - tuned balance between biosynthesis and degradation of proteins	1
4639	The @GENE$ system ( UPS ) constitutes the main non - lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that comprises three major components : the @GENE$ , a number of @GENE$ and a broad variety of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
4640	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is attached to @GENE$ by the cascade - like catalytic action of E1 , E2 and @GENE$	1
4641	The @GENE$ molecule is activated by an @GENE$ , followed by the transfer to one of numerous @GENE$ , and finally an @GENE$ catalyzes the transfer of @GENE$ onto the ε - amino group of a Lysine residue within the target protein ( for review see [ 1 ] )	1
4642	Thereby , the	1
4643	One of our goals is to learn what is the accuracy of each of our methods when partial information about G big is available ( see Section ' Robustness test ' for experimental settings )	1
4644	Figure 2 shows the results of this robustness evaluation , for pseudoknotted structures ( Figure 2A ) , pseudoknot - free structures ( Figure 2B ) and the overall results ( Figure 2C )	1
4645	Since @GENE$ cannot add @GENE$ to the given input structure , we do not compare its performance here with HFold and Iterative @GENE$	1
4646	However we provide detailed performance of all versions of @GENE$ including @GENE$ in Additional file 3 .	1
4647	Funding : This research received no external funding .	1
4648	To focus on the effects of the infectious period distribution on different courses of intervention we have assumed that all those who are quarantined and exposed are detected before the end of the quarantine period and are not released back into the general population	1
4649	We have also formulated a model that takes into account the distribution of the latent period during quarantine and find similar qualitative results to those shown in Figure 4	1
4650	However , if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period and there is only a small amount of isolation of infected individuals , then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma - distributed model , because more exposed individuals in the exponentially distributed model will leave quarantine before they develop the infection .	1
4651	In this paper it is demonstrated how such a system can be developed using a new distributed workflow design system called Quascade	1
4652	As a proof of concept , results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 isolates and @DISEASE$ viruses are presented	1
4653	Various phylogenetic algorithms ; i	1
4654	e	1
4655	UPGMA , Neighbor - Joining , Maximum Parsimony , Maximum Likelihood and Mr	1
4656	Bayes [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results	1
4657	In particular , the presented study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in a unique user - friendly workflow in order to enhance the efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis .	1
4658	To determine whether @GENE$ acts via the proteasomal pathway , Hsu cells were transfected with the @GENE$ and , at 24 h post - transfection , infected with @DISEASE$ and treated simultaneously with either MG132 ( 10 μM ) o@GENE$ me E1 inhibitor PYR - 41 ( 10 μM )	1
4659	Real - time RT - qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 hpi showed decr@GENE$ xVir1 expression in cells overexpre@GENE$ xCul4 compared with control ( empty vector ) cells in @DISEASE$ infected cells	1
4660	However , treatment of cells ove@GENE$ sing CxCul4 with MG132 or PYR - 41 resulted in significantly highe@GENE$ s of CxVir1 expression compared with untreated cells	1
4661	Real - time RT - q@GENE$ for WNV NS1 showed there was a decrease in viral replication in cells trans@GENE$ with CxCul4 and treated with MG132 or PYR - 41 compared with th@GENE$ ol ( CxCul4 transfection alone ) ( Fig 4D )	1
4662	To further determine sign@GENE$ e o@GENE$ ul4 in STAT signaling , Hsu cells were transfected with ds@GENE$ inst CxCul4	1
4663	As a control , cells were either not transfected ( No dsRNA ) or transfected with ds@GENE$ ag@GENE$ ( GFP dsRNA )	1
4664	Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post - transfection and total RNA was collected 48 hpi	1
4665	Real time RT -@GENE$ ir1 primers showed increased expression after @DISEASE$ infection which was further increased in cells@GENE$ with CxCul4 d@GENE$ Fig 4E )	1
4666	CxVago on the other hand showed increased expression after @DISEASE$ infection with no further@GENE$ cells with CxCul4 dsRNA	1
4667	To d@GENE$ e that @GENE$ of CxCUl4 is via CxSTAT , cell@GENE$ ected with CxSTAT dsRNA a@GENE$ th dsRNA against CxCul4	1
4668	Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post - transfection	1
4669	Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and re@GENE$ R using WNV NS1 primers showed significant@GENE$ ease in cells with CxST dsRNA and decrease in cells with CxCul4 dsRNA	1
4670	Cells containing both CxCul4 and CxSTAT dsRNA showed no decrease in WNV NS1 levels indicating that CxCul4 action required CxSTAT ( Fig 4F )	1
4671	These results confirm that pro - viral effect of CxCul4 is via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway .	1
4672	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ that transfers electrons to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + ) , reducing it to NADH , and oxidizes xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid	1
4673	Nevertheless , under stress conditions , the @GENE$ is converted to an @GENE$ and , under these conditions , the enzyme reduces oxygen instead of NAD +	1
4674	On this way , there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide	1
4675	Superoxide anion can be generated by this system ( the @GENE$ ) or using a non - enzymatic reaction	1
4676	In this case , superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen	1
4677	In both cases , superoxide anion reduces nitro - blue tetrazolium ( NBT ) into formazan which is followed spectrophotometrically [ 5 ] .	1
4678	Eugenia caryophyllus ( clove ) showed the highest ferric reducing capacity in terms of Trolox ® concentrations , such as in the DPPH method , in contrast to the TBARS method , in which Thymus vulgaris showed to be more effective [ 52 ]	1
4679	According to the same authors , a significant linear correlation between @GENE$ values and total phenolic contents of the essential oils analysed were observed , except for the Thymus vulgaris essential oil .	1
4680	@DISEASE$ predominate in the clinical picture of @DISEASE$	1
4681	@DISEASE$ include @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or more rarely @DISEASE$	1
4682	They are generalized or localized , symmetrical or asymmetric and may , though less frequently , appear all over the body in a focal , multifocal , regional or diffuse pattern [ 12 - 14 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 62 , 64 , 68 , 70 ]	1
4683	Some cats may harbour different types of @DISEASE$ at the same time or develop them subsequently ; they may coexist with @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
4684	3 )	1
4685	@DISEASE$ , of variable size , are more often localized on the head , including eyelids , nose and lips , or on the distal parts of the limbs	1
4686	Nodules have @DISEASE$ which may be diffuse and superficial or focal and deep ( Fig	1
4687	4 ) are localized on the same body sites as @DISEASE$ , and may be complicated by @DISEASE$ that explain why they are covered by @DISEASE$ crusts and / or purulent material [ 13 , 14 , 52 , 53 , 56 , 58 , 60 - 62 , 64 , 65 , 68 , 70 ]	1
4688	However , @DISEASE$ is sometimes diffuse and can be observed on the body trunk or on bony prominences [ 14 , 36 , 58 , 62 , 63 ] .	1
4689	Among the 119 enrolled cases , 118 conformed with the inclusion criteria and were all sampled	1
4690	One patient without radiological confirmation was excluded from the analysis	1
4691	Among the 100 included controls , 2 were excluded because of missing data .	1
4692	The @DISEASE$ are described in Question 7	1
4693	@DISEASE$ may be solitary or multicentric	1
4694	@DISEASE$ have been reported in approximately one third of the affected cats	1
4695	@DISEASE$ , either unilateral or bilateral ( Fig	1
4696	1 ) , is the most common @DISEASE$ described , with occasionally a pseudotumoral granulomatous pattern and eventually progress to @DISEASE$ [ 50 , 53 , 55 , 64 , 69 ]	1
4697	@DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have also been described in a number of clinical cases [ 66 , 68 , 70 ]	1
4698	Amastigotes have been found by cytology in @DISEASE$ , corneal infiltrates and aqueous humor , and by histopathology after enucleation of the eye or post mortem even in uveal tissue [ 50 , 53 , 55 , 64 , 69 ]	1
4699	@DISEASE$ is also a common clinical finding and has been found in about one fourth of the cats so far studied with @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
4700	2 ) [ 11 , 26 , 53 , 55 , 63 , 66 , 70 ]	1
4701	@DISEASE$ are unfrequently seen on the gingival mucosa or the tongue [ 60 , 66 , 69 , 71 ] , where infected macrophages may be visualized in lesion biopses [ 60 , 69 ] .	1
4702	On the basis of the epidemiological evidence , several translational rodent models have been established to investigate a potential causal relationship between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ 1	1
4703	Following the discovery , in the 1980s , of the increased risk of @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$ 37 , models of viral - like immune activation by polyriboinosinic - polyribocytidilic acid ( poly ( I : C ) ) have been widely studied 3@GENE$ n addition , models of bacterial - like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and @DISEASE$ in offspring , similar to the poly ( I : C ) models 38	1
4704	However , with respect to neuro@GENE$ exposure may have a stronger effect on the fetal brain than poly ( I : C ) exposure 29	1
4705	Thus , the type of pathogen i@GENE$  the pattern of @DISEASE$ of the offspring , and the timing and dose of the pathogen ' s administration , in addition to the strain or species , may also have an influence	1
4706	The present model of prenatal exposure to LPS led to impairments in short - term memory and social interaction at 3 to 4 weeks after birth .	1
4707	We evaluated phylogenetic classification and relationship between the 5 new @GENE$ obtained in this study and previously published @GENE$ ( Fig	1
4708	3 )	1
4709	Full genome Figure S3	1
4710	There was phylogenetic congruence with the individual gene sequence sets as with the full genome dataset , except for @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) .	1
4711	In any phylogenetic analysis involving pathogenic viruses there are three clear possibilities of clustering behavior : spatial , temporal and host based	1
4712	Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host	1
4713	Of course , single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and , hence , we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work	1
4714	However , even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study	1
4715	Even with the limited amount of data , we have been able to find a clear pattern ( geographical clustering ) and the importance of glycon sites	1
4716	However , further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ etc	1
4717	, and also at gene and genome level , are required to draw firm conclusions	1
4718	It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large	1
4719	In our experience , zooming onto a cluster of interest ( e	1
4720	g	1
4721	Thailand and China clades ) with relative ease and quickness , using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study	1
4722	Furthermore , the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another attractive attribute .	1
4723	Due to the difficulties associated with geographic partitioning , we used algorithms to optimally define communities in the global air transportation network as an alternative strategy to specify phylogeographic states , and subsequently show that our GLM results are robust to the different partitions used	1
4724	Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal , communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data	1
4725	However , in addition to the partitioning itself , further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down - sampling based on population size .	1
4726	Before the challenge , all of the animals looked healthy and did not display egg - eating behavior	1
4727	During the 4 weeks of adaptation , we recorded the number , shape , color and shell thickness of eggs , and all parameters resulted to be within the normal ranges of the commercial line .	1
4728	For qRRT - PCR assays of blood and organs , a standard curve was generated using triplicates of ten - fold serial dilutions of @GENE$ to obtain the quantification of the samples expressed in copies / µL	1
4729	The @GENE$ was generated using the MEGAscript T7 transcription Kit ( Ambion ® , Austin , USA ) with the H7N1 subtype A / ostrich / Italy / 984 / 2000 strain as a template .	1
4730	In deer mice infected with @DISEASE$ , early expression signatures of a mixed Th1 / Th2 / Treg response were present in virus - specific CD4 + T cells , incl@GENE$  I@GENE$ , @GENE$ , Il@GENE$  Tgfβ , before transitioning to a Treg - like response at persistence [ 54 ]	1
4731	The expressi@GENE$ genes differed in the spleen , where signatures of inflammation occurred within two days , peaking by days 10 to 15 before subsiding , and lungs , where little immune gene expression occurred [ 13 ]	1
4732	Some deer mice pro@GENE$ c IgG by day 10 while other@GENE$ d IgG around day 20 or later @GENE$ ibody was not detected until after 3 weeks .	1
4733	In the UK , livestock has to be removed 4 h after the last market sale and consequently does not stay overnight at a livestock market [ 42 ]	1
4734	Therefore , we assumed that cattle are moved on and off a market on the same day , and that an infectious market becomes susceptible again the following day	1
4735	If this assumption were to be relaxed , the model could be altered by giving markets a longer infectious period .	1
4736	For outbreaks seeded in Cumbria and simulated on the full dataset , we obtain a final mean epidemic size of 185 farms , with a mean duration of 22 weeks and a mean peak size of 45 farms ( figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , figure S8 )	1
4737	The mean epidemic sizes after 6 and 12 weeks were 23 and 64 farms , respectively	1
4738	For all node sampling methods without rescaling , the epidemic size is under - predicted as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases ( figure 2 )	1
4739	After six weeks , S min ¼ 3 % for the TNS method , 20 % for the SBS method and 80 % for the RNS method	1
4740	After 12 weeks , the percentage of nodes that must be sampled increases to 9 % , 30 % and 90 % for the TNS , SBS and RNS methods , respectively ( figure 2b )	1
4741	In order for these methods to accurately predict the full epidemic , 14 % , 40 % and 90 % of the nodes must be sampled for the TNS , SBS and RNS methods , respectively ( figure 2c )	1
4742	For the RMS method , S min ¼ 30 % for 6 weeks , 50 % for 12 weeks and 80 % for the whole epidemic	1
4743	Contour plots for epidemic size predictions for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria for each week of the outbreak ( from week 1 to the end of the epidemic ) are shown in electronic supplementary material , figures S8 - S11	1
4744	All methods provide accurate predictions of the size of the epidemic in the first few weeks	1
4745	However , for longer durations , the TNS and the SBS methods provide the most robust predictions of epidemic size over time	1
4746	Similar behaviour is observed for model predictions of epidemic duration and epidemic peak size ( electronic supplementary material , figures S8 - S11b , c ) - the TNS method is able to accurately capture these characteristics when only 15 % of the nodes are sampled , compared with 30 % , 80 % and 90 % for the SBS , RMS and RNS methods , respectively .	1
4747	Nursing has long been considered as one of the most stressful professions	1
4748	Stress in nursing is attributed largely to the physical labor , suffering , and emotional demands of patients and families ; long working hours , shift work , and interpersonal relationships	1
4749	Sophisticated healthcare technologies , budget cuts , increasing workload , and constant organizational changes in some healthcare environments appear to be the factors that have increased stress among nurses	1
4750	Nurses seem to be overexposed to a range of psychosocial stressors	1
4751	As a result , it is important that they receive psychological support regularly in order for them to cope in their working environment and remain productive	1
4752	Below are the comments made by the participants :	1
4753	According to the findings of the present study @DISEASE$ nurses feel unappreciated for what they are doing	1
4754	@DISEASE$ nurses are on the frontline of the fight against the highly infectious diseases that affect many people	1
4755	In spite of this , they do not receive a danger allowance and the hospital does not celebrate TB day as a way of appreciating @DISEASE$ nurses as pioneers in the hospitals who risk their lives in order to fight @DISEASE$	1
4756	In support of these findings , Loghmani et al	1
4757	[ 29 ] reported that the participants ' experiences were that the families believed that nurses did not do their best for the patients and that they abused the patients	1
4758	The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Sodeify et al	1
4759	[ 30 ] , which concluded that South African nurses were not well supported , appreciated , recognized , and well - rewarded ; unlike in other countries since they provide quality service to patients under very difficult circumstances with limited resources	1
4760	This is why they leave South Africa to work in other countries .	1
4761	Database searching and protein quantitation	1
4762	All raw data files generated by mass spectrometry were analysed by Proteome Discoverer software 1	1
4763	3 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using the Mascot search engine against the Felis catus protein sequences downloaded from the NCBI reference sequences ( Refseq ) database ( downloaded on March 20 , 2015 , containing 35 , 247 entries )	1
4764	The parameters for database searching were as follows : @GENE$ was selected as the enzyme ; up to two missed cleavages were allowed ; the precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set to 15 ppm and 20 mmu , respectively ; carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification ; oxidation on methionine and @GENE$ at the @GENE$ and at @GENE$ were allowed as dynamic modifications	1
4765	The strict maximum parsimony principle was applied , and only peptide spectrum matches with high or medium confidence were considered for protein grouping	1
4766	Ion peaks were integrated based on the most confident centroid with a tolerance of 20 ppm .	1
4767	Previous studies have shown that the @GENE$ exhibits anti - tumour activity in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ 13 , 15 , but the complete mechanisms of its anti - cancer activity have not been revealed	1
4768	In this study , we first identified a group of @DISEASE$@GENE$ roteomics technique	1
4769	Some of these proteins were not noted for CPV - induced apoptosis or anti - cancer function , which would provide a new perspective for studying the anti - cancer mechanisms of CPV .	1
4770	The duration of anti - infective treatment was significantly longer in the IVIG group than that in the control group ( control , median 12 days ; 2 - 40 days ; IVIG , median 18 days ; 3 - 65 days ; t test , log - transformed data , p = 0	1
4771	0096 )	1
4772	Six patients in the control group and four patients in the IVIG group underwent anti - infective treatment before admission to the ICU	1
4773	Excluding these patients , the duration of anti - infective therapy relative to LOS in the ICU was not significantly different between the groups ( control median , 71 % fraction of LOS ICU ; IVIG , 79 % of LOS ICU ) .	1
4774	Cinnamaldehyde , isolated from an essential oil produced from the leaves of Cinnamomum osmophloeum , was reported to inhibit the secretion of @GENE$ and @GENE$ within LPS or lipoteichoic acid ( LTA ) stimulated murine J774A	1
4775	1 macrophages	1
4776	Cinnamaldehyde also suppressed the production of these @GENE$ from LPS stimulated human blood monocytes derived primary macrophages and human THP - 1 monocytes [ 111 ] .	1
4777	It is important that studies of this system are based on reliable and accurate diagnostics	1
4778	@DISEASE$ infection status was initially determined using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Scott and Keymer 1981 ) , but more recently conventional PCR ) and qPCR ( Atkin et al	1
4779	2010 ; Fiegna et al	1
4780	2016 ) assays have been developed	1
4781	As grey squirrels appear asymptomatic , lower infection loads are recorded , and thus it is essential to use the more sensitive qPCR assays when screening for @DISEASE$ presence as part of a wildlife disease management programme for red squirrels	1
4782	For @DISEASE$ , confirmation has relied on either TEM ( Everest et al	1
4783	2008 ) or conventional qualitative PCR assays ( Everest et al	1
4784	2009b )	1
4785	No assay for either pathogen has incorporated an IC ( either exogenous or endogenous )	1
4786	Additionally , the use of ICs to monitor squirrel pathogens is essential because @DISEASE$ ( Simpson et al	1
4787	2010 ( Simpson et al	1
4788	, 2013a and @DISEASE$ ( Everest et al	1
4789	2009a ) show similar lesions to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , respectively	1
4790	This presents a clear opportunity for misdiagnosis ( in the absence of other diagnostic tests ) if the pathogen assay reports a false negative , for example due to unrecognised presence of PCR inhibitors .	1
4791	The addition of the bacterial toxin pneumolysin reduced the mean CBF of ependymal cilia within 5 minutes ( Table 1 )	1
4792	The mean CBF values after 5 minutes exposure to pneumolysin determined by the @GENE$ was 21	1
4793	45 ± 4	1
4794	1 Hz	1
4795	Using the direct counting method , two different observers calculated a mean CBF of 21	1
4796	75 ± 4	1
4797	5 Hz and 21	1
4798	79 ± 4	1
4799	2 Hz respectively	1
4800	Repeatability ( agreement between methods ) was very good and presented values similar to the agreement between two different observers ( 1	1
4801	13 Hz and 1	1
4802	08 Hz respectively )	1
4803	At 15 minutes after the addition of pneumolysin the cilia were mostly static ( Figure 2 )	1
4804	The @GENE$ accurately predicted the reduction in CBF and detected regions of interest where the cilia had become static .	1
4805	Rapid development in polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) technology has revolutionised the speed and accuracy of many diagnostic assays	1
4806	However , comparatively few wildlife epidemiological studies use quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) for pathogen detection , even fewer employ an internal control , to ensure confidence in negative results , and PCR ' s ability to multiplex and therefore detect several targets in a single reaction is underutilised	1
4807	Here , we describe the development of two multiplex qPCR assays for the red and grey squirrel that detect the pathogens @DISEASE$ ( SQPV ) and @DISEASE$ in squirrels ( SADV ) , both of which cause mortality in the red squirrel	1
4808	Both assays use a section of the squirrel @GENE$ ogenous internal control that identifies and compensates for both , inadequate sampling or PCR inhibition	1
4809	Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples ( particularly from distal antebrachial skin ) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of SQPV DNA @GENE$ quirrel species , while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate @DISEASE$ infection	1
4810	These assays are sensitive and specific with an endogenous internal control providing confidence in negative results and allowing comparison across laboratories	1
4811	Using such assays should prove advantageous in wildlife studies with limited resources while allowing the maximum data yield .	1

4832	The problem of ID - to - name conversion has been partially addressed in the NEXUS alignment format [ 24 ] , which has a reserved part ( block ) for converting names in a predefined manner , and in the stand - alone tool Phyutility [ 25 ] that allows combining a limited number of GenBank characteristics with a custom separator to form @GENE$	1

4851	@GENE$ Is Pro - Viral during @DISEASE$ Infection of Culex Mosquitoes	1
4852	To this end , we recently have successfully developed transgenic mice carrying the known @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 11 , 12 ]	1
4853	The @DISEASE$ - like @DISEASE$ were observed in transgenic mice pre - infected with clinical isolates E59 ( genotype B4 of EV71 ) and N2838 ( B5 ) ; severe @DISEASE$ and death in transgenic mice pre - inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 ( C2 ) , N3340 ( C4@GENE$ and coxsackievirus A16 ( CVA16 ) [ 11 ]	1
4854	EV71 viral loads in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pr@GENE$ CX@GENE$ CC@GENE$ TN@GENE$ and IL@GENE$ , correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that resulted in severe diseases in transgenic mice [ 11 ]	1
4855	It was also observed in EV71 patients with @DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ that have a higher mortality rate ( 64	1
4856	3 % ) than patients with @DISEASE$ ( 26	1
4857	3 % ) [ 13 , 14 ] , @DISEASE$ might be caused by increased @DISEASE$ vascular permeability resulting from @DISEASE$ caused by the excessive release of IL - 6 , TNF@GENE$ IL@GENE$ an@GENE$ c [ 13@GENE$ 16 ]	1
4858	In this study , we investigate whether the hSCARB2 - tr@GENE$  mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 - speci@GENE$	1
4859	Administration of N3 to transgenic mice reduced the developed @DISEASE$ and scurfy skin as well as @DISEASE$ induced by E59 infection and protected from severe @DISEASE$ resulting in death by 5746 infection	1
4860	This protection associates with the reduction of the viral load in the brain , spinal cords , and limb muscles	1
4861	It also associated with the reduction of the secreted proinflammatory mediat@GENE$ ults demonstrated N3 might have potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of EV71 - induced severely @DISEASE$ patients .	1
4862	Western Asia is a region recognized as a geopolitical entity but not always clearly defined across international agencies ( e	1

4865	To delimit " Western Asia " for the purposes of this review , we include the following 20 countries : Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Georgia , Jordan , Kuwait , Lebanon , Iraq , Iran , Israel , Oman , Pakistan , Palestine , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and Yemen	1
4866	While Afghanistan and Pakistan are often considered part of " Central " or " South " Asia , we include both in this review as they serve as an important biogeographic gateway linking bats and ( potentially ) their associated pathogens with Asian countries to the east .	1
4867	Lactate Dehydrogenase - Elevating Virus Induces Systemic Lymphocyte Activation via @GENE$ - Dependent @GENE$ Responses by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells	1
4868	In the human respiratory tract cilia beat in a coordinated fashion at a frequency of approximately 10 to 14 Hz , propelling mucus towards the pharynx where it is swallowed [ 1 ]	1
4869	This process is known as mucociliary clearance ( MCC )	1
4870	In the brain , ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz , moving cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) close to the ventricular wall	1
4871	Many factors , including @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , temperature , pH , viscosity and exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens have been shown affect ciliary function [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
4872	Recent studies have shown that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]	1
4873	The most accurate method for determining ciliary beat frequency , particularly at high beat frequencies is by directly timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles from slow - motion playback of high - speed video files [ 7 ]	1
4874	However , this is extremely time consuming and automated methods designed to rapidly measure beat frequency from high - speed video recordings are needed [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .	1
4875	All contrasts performed using the mixed - effects models were corrected for the multiple comparisons using stepwise correction , to achieve a family wise error rate of 5 % within each measure	1
4876	The hypothesis tests of correlations were corrected using the false discovery rate method of Benjamini - Hochberg , to the 5 % level	1

4880	We have suggested here that blow flies are likely candidates for mechanical transmission of @DISEASE$ because of their ecological and physiological characteristics as reviewed here	1
4881	In fact , blow flies have already been recognized as important vectors for mechanical transmission of several serious @DISEASE$ , that is , @DISEASE$ [ 28 ] , rabbit @DISEASE$ [ 29 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 30 ]	1
4882	Recently , it has been reported that the H5N1 viral gene was d@GENE$  flies [ 31 ] and engorged mosquitoes [ 32 ]	1
4883	We suggest that mechanical transmission by flies may also be involved in the outbreak and pandemic of @DISEASE$ other than @DISEASE$	1
4884	However , although there are high densities of a variety of fly species during all seasons in Southeast Asia , their ability to transmit viruses has not been evaluated	1
4885	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ is still a public health problem for birds and humans	1
4886	Therefore , field and laboratory studies on mechanical transmission of pathogens by flies would be very important for controlling @DISEASE$ outbreaks , at least in epidemic Southeast Asian countries	1
4887	Recently , the H5N1 virus surveillance conducted in Indonesia suggested that pigs are at risk of infection during outbreaks and pigs can serve as intermediate hosts in which this avian virus can adapt to mammals [ 33 ]	1
4888	They also found the evidence of pig - to - pig transmission of this virus without any significant influenza - like signs	1
4889	The transmission mechanism of this virus became more complicated and serious	1
4890	As we introduced in the previous section , blow flies prefer to lick carcasses and droppings of not only chickens but also pigs	1
4891	Furthermore , we can assume that the flies can access the pigpen easier than the poultry farm	1
4892	This finding from Indonesia [ 33 ] strongly suggest that it is important to pay attention to pigpens as well as poultry farms within 2 - 3 km , where viable H5N1 viruses are transmitted by blow flies .	1
4893	Fear mongering has been criticized in the literature , since it has the potential to distort the evidence , which should guide credible decision - making	1
4894	It is therefore critical to assess the credibility and quality of the evidence that is being used to inform the response to epidemics around the world , particularly in light of the complicated and often problematic relationship between the academic and industry ( Bonneux and Van Damme 2010 )	1
4895	In determining the credibility of evidence , consideration should be given to the legitimacy and authority of its producer ( s ) .	1
4896	Over time , a decrease of both the viral titers and the presence of the negative - sense strand was observed in the treatment colonies	1
4897	It may well be that the treatment colonies would eventually reach a low viral level such as the controls , display low level replication and at that both A and B strains are present	1
4898	However , we have no data to address those questions	1
4899	What could explain the observed decrease of viral titers over time ? Neither altruistic self - removal of infected nestmates [ 70 ] nor increased mortality in the treatment colonies were observed	1
4900	Therefore , the higher initial viral titers and the more common minus - strand presence could reflect virus particles consumed with the infected honeybee food	1
4901	In light of ant physiology [ 71 ] , this is nevertheless unlikely to explain the comparatively high viral titers and especially the presence of the minus strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus - infected food has been consumed	1
4902	The most parsimonious explanation therefore is that the ants were fed with highly virus saturated honeybee pupae resulting in initial viral peaks , then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected ant individuals later	1
4903	In light of these results , it appears as if controlled laboratory experiments are required before drawing general conclusions on the role of predators / scavengers as alternative hosts of any honeybee viruses , i	1
4904	e	1
4905	, the timing of the last virus - infected food consumption should be known	1
4906	Similarly , the detection of the negative - sense strand in V	1
4907	destructor suggested DWV replication in the mites until recently , when a non - propagative manner DWV transmission has been proposed [ 72 ] .	1
4908	All 30 paediatric hospitals in Bavaria equipped for paediatric intensive care treatment of children older than 1 month of age were invited to participate	1
4909	These PICUs reported a total of 432 intensive care beds ( median 14 , IQR [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] , including 207 beds ( median 9 , IQR 6 - 12 ) equipped with ventilation facilities	1
4910	, all patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were enrolled : i ) admission to a participating PICU with suspected @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) of the upper or lower respiratory tract , with @DISEASE$ symptoms ( for example , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ ) ; ii ) age at PICU admission due to @DISEASE$ at least 1 month and below 17 years of age ; iii ) parental written informed consent	1
4911	Enrolled children with PCR - confirmed @DISEASE$ were classed as @DISEASE$ .	1
4912	We conducted a cross - sectional study in January 2016 to assess whether LPHC and EMS workers were infected and to determine their degree of exposure	1
4913	The participants had contact with @DISEASE$ - confirmed patients or their specimens during the outbreak and volunteered to participate in this study	1
4914	The survey , which was a face - to - face interview , examined subjects ' general characteristics , professional responsibilities , contact history , symptoms after exposure and use of PPE .	1
4915	MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV are two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have caused hundreds of deaths	1
4916	On one hand , the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way	1
4917	[ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On the other hand , the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing	1
4918	The @GENE$ is a @GENE$ factor by virtue of its @GENE$ - antagonizing property	1
4919	Both the MERS - CoV and @GENE$ were found to suppress @GENE$ production with a highly similar mechanism in which the @GENE$ of TRAF3 · TANK @GENE$ was affected by their @GENE$	1
4920	30 , 32 Interestingly , in the case of community - acquired human coronavirus HKU1 , which normally causes common cold in infected individuals , its @GENE$ showed no @GENE$ antagonistic property , 32 further supporting the importance of the @GENE$ in SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV pathogenesis	1
4921	Using a side - by - side comparison of SARS - CoV and @GENE$ , we discovered that the extent by which the @GENE$ suppressed @GENE$ promoter activity was lower than that by @GENE$	1
4922	This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of @GENE$ with other @GENE$	1
4923	Whereas the @GENE$ was found to be strongly associated with @GENE$ , its interaction with @GENE$ or @GENE$ was undetectable ( data not shown )	1
4924	This distinguished @GENE$ from the @GENE$ , which interacts potently with every component of the @GENE$	1
4925	30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the @GENE$ with @GENE$ might influence MERS - CoV pathogenesis .	1
4926	Not all @GENE$ were capable of stimulating @GENE$	1
4927	The lack of activity of @GENE$ and @GENE$ is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization	1
4928	@GENE$ are globally similar , with @GENE$ located at analogous positions in the protein , whereas the linker separating @GENE$ and @GENE$ is shorter in @GENE$ and much longer in @GENE$ ( Figure 3D )	1
4929	These differences did not affect association of @GENE$ with @GENE$ , but could affect the strength of binding of individual @GENE$ to RNA or alternatively , preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the @GENE$	1
4930	With the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding , ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce @GENE$	1
4931	However , we saw differential activity in @GENE$ of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting − 1 @GENE$ , but with reduced − 2 @GENE$	1
4932	When RNA association was examined by EMSA , @GENE$ and @GENE$ bound to the @GENE$ with similar affinity and in an @GENE$ [UNK] - dependent manner , although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the @DISEASE$ proteins	1
4933	This suggest@GENE$ 1 KH@GENE$ 2 KH1m still associate with the RNA , but the stability , conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the c@GENE$ 2 K@GENE$ is PRF possible , and on@GENE$  1 PRF ( which is the predominant frameshift event @GENE$  PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance )	1
4934	As noted in the ' Results ' section , compensatory activ@GENE$ in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually in@GENE$ 1 KH@GENE$ 1 KH3m , suggesting that two ( or @GENE$  PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting	1
4935	The differential activ@GENE$ 1 KH@GENE$ 2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo - oligomerize .	1
4936	The gene encoding @GENE$ was introduced into HeLa cells to test whether 3D8 scFv expressing cell lines could protect against @DISEASE$	1

4947	33 ) and was similar to the results shown in the quantitative real - time RT - PCR analysis ( Figure 1C )	1
4948	Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 @GENE$ geted and locali@GENE$  both the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure 1D )	1
4949	Common features of anti - DNA antibodies that hav@GENE$ sitively - charged residues within complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) of VH or VL domains due to their antigen binding properties , which resemble the nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells , such as cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) [ 29 ]	1
4950	Therefore , 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in the cytosol using a vector system and targeted to the nucleus by a NLS .	1
4951	@DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ are known to occur in welldefined recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [ 1 , 2 ]	1
4952	In tropical and subtropical areas , @DISEASE$ infections have been reported to peak more often in relation to the wet season , but locations close to the equator show a less consistent pattern , some with almost continuous @DISEASE$ activity and varying seasonal peaks [ 1 , 7 ]	1
4953	Studies in the Indian subcontinent have reported @DISEASE$ to peak both in the cold season [ 27 ] and in the rainy season [ 35 , 36 ] , as well as being detectable throughout the year [ 35 , 37 ]	1
4954	We observed @DISEASE$ epidemics both in winter and during the monsoon	1
4955	The virus was isolated during a period of 6 to 7 months and the epidemic peaks were observed with intervals of 15 and 9 months , which is consistent with patterns described elsewhere [ 31 , 38 ] .	1
4956	Despite two of the three @DISEASE$ epidemics occurring during the summer monsoon , neither rainfall nor temperature was significantly associated with @DISEASE$ in our study , while there was a positive correlation with relative humidity	1
4957	In tropical Asian countries , somewhat contradictory patterns of associations between @DISEASE$ and meteorological factors have been observed	1
4958	In Hong Kong , the monthly incidence of @DISEASE$ was positively correlated with both temperature and relative humidity [ 48 ] , whereas in Malaysia , the number of @DISEASE$ infections was inversely correlated with temperature [ 52 ]	1
4959	@DISEASE$ peaked towards the end of the rainy season during the first and third year of our study	1
4960	We explored whether there could be an association between preceding rainfall and @DISEASE$ , and by introducing a 2 - month lag after peak precipitation , such an association could indeed be identified ( data not shown ) .	1
4961	To identify sequences for inhibitor development , a selection of 14 - mer peptides from the @GENE$ that underwent complete hydrolysis during the assay were compared using label - free quantitation of peptide cleavage kinetics ( Supplemental Figure 2 )	1
4962	Five - residue long peptides containing P1 - P4 ′ residues from primary cleavages in the library were synthesized and tested for their ability to prevent the cleavage of a fluorogenic alanine substrate by @GENE$	1
4963	From these initial peptides , only @GENE$ was able to appreciably inhibit substrate cleavage with an IC 50 of 6	1
4964	5 μM , whereas the remaining peptides all had IC 50 values above 500 μM ( Table 1 )	1
4965	Replacement of the P1 residue norleucine of @GENE$ with either leucine or alanine did not have a significant impact on the IC 50 , resulting in low μM inhibitors	1
4966	Complete removal of the P1 norleucine , resulting in the 4 - mer peptide @GENE$ , only decreased the potency of the inhibitor to 43 μM .	1
4967	The @GENE$ web site has six pages including a detailed guide to @GENE$ with examples ( " Introduction " ) , program execution page ( " Execution " ) , guided access to Java and Perl APIs ( " @GENE$ " ) , frequently asked questions page ( " FAQs " ) , list of the @GENE$ versions ( " History " ) , and " Reference " page	1
4968	@GENE$ execution page has three vertically arranged sections : " Before unique ID ( UID ) conversion " for uploading input , " Names / format designer " for choosing and refining pre - compiled name templates , and " After UID conversion " for accessing output ( Figure 2 ) .	1
4969	To engender strong public support for quarantine and other restrictive measures , government officials and public health policy - makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards , to educate and inform frontline public health workers , and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during @DISEASE$ outbreaks .	1
4970	Previous analyses of the sources of indoor exposures have shown that outdoor air is a significant source of exposures	1
4971	Therefore the second scenario was determined as an attempt to control the burden of disease by filtration the exposures originating from outdoor air	1
4972	Because both ultrafine and coarse particles and chemically reactive pollutants like ozone have lower infiltration factors than PM 2	1
4973	5 , dominated by accumulation mode particles , the filtration was specified for PM 2	1
4974	5 particles .	1
4975	This can be seen when comparing the sources of the burden of disease in Finland ( Figure 3 ) and in other EU - 26 countries ( Table 4 ) with the population - weighted mean of EU - 26 countries	1
4976	It is readily apparent that in Finland the role of ambient particles is lower than in Europe in general , but that both bio - aerosols ( pollen ) and radon play much more significant roles	1
4977	Especially the contribution of radon is double to that of the European average , highlighting the geology peculiarities of the Finnish soil .	1
4978	Considering the above , the present study addressed @DISEASE$ infection of the porcine airway mucosal epithelium , which represents an important first physical barrier for the entrance of pathogens into hosts	1
4979	In addition , epithelial cells also contribute to innate antiviral responses through the producti@GENE$ ki@GENE$ kines @GENE$  IFNs ( 55 ) ( 56 ) ( 57 )	1
4980	To also address mucociliary activities , we used well - differentiated primary NEC cultures and demonstrated that JEV infects epithelial cells from nasal mucosal explants as well as NEC cultures ( summarized in Fig	1
4981	10 )	1
4982	Despite the fact that respiratory viruses are normally shed only apically and rarely basolaterally , JEV is shed to both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelial cells and such an infection could thus mediate virus entry into the host as well as oronasal virus spread to other hosts in a manner principally comparable to that of @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$	1
4983	Our in vitro results complements previously published in vivo findings , which can explain the high efficiency of @DISEASE$ infection of pigs via the oronasal route and are in line with different experiments which showed oronasal shedding several days beyond the end of viremia , and they additionally can explain the detection of high levels of JEV @GENE$ asal mucosa , which can last up to 10 days after challenge ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 )	1
4984	The in vivo relevance of the presented data is further supported by the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs , it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia ( 9 ) , pointing to a local cellular source for virus replication , which is also supported by a recent study in which the larger JEV @GENE$ nt was detected in nasal mucosa ( 11 ) .	1
4985	In direct methods , they can be based on the kinetic of lipid peroxidation or on the kinetic of nonchain process ( direct competition methods )	1
4986	In the first case , two modes of lipid peroxidation can be used for testing the antioxidant activity : one of them is the autoxidation mode when the process is progressing spontaneously , with self - acceleration due to the accumulation of LOOH ; the other mode is based on the use of the kinetic model of the controlled chain reaction	1
4987	The utilization of thermo - labile azo - compounds [ water - soluble 2 , 2 ' - azobis ( 2 - amidinopropane ) dihydrochloride ( AAPH ) and lipidsoluble 2 , 2 ' - azobis ( 2 , 4 - dimethylvaleronitrile ) ( AMVN ) ] that decompose and produce active free radicals at moderate temperatures at any desired rate , which can be easily altered and controlled are two good examples greatly used [ 29 ]	1
4988	When these thermo - labile azo - compounds are not used , and for accelerating lipid oxidation , increased partial oxygen pressure and temperature ; addition of transition metal catalysts ; exposure to light ; and variable shaking and free radical sources may be used [ 5 ] .	1
4989	Altogether , this study underlines the strong potential for ODN 2216 in the prevention of a large variety of @DISEASE$	1
4990	CpG -@GENE$ d thus not be left aside when stimulating innate immunity for prophylactic purposes	1
4991	Future studies should aim at optimizing the kinetics of these molecules in vivo , while addressing safety , stability and manufacturing issues	1
4992	Combinations with adjuvants or other TLR a@GENE$ sts as well as optimized administration protocols should support research in this direction	1
4993	Field studies with larger cohorts of animals will provide further insights on the utilization of CpG -@GENE$ he prevention of @DISEASE$ in a clinical setting .	1
4994	Through interaction with the @GENE$ , @GENE$ typically induce expression of both @GENE$ and @GENE$ in stimulated cells [ 12 ]	1
4995	In order to understand whether ODN 2216 exert similar effects in the cat , treated cultures of feline PBMCs , FEA , CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells were systematically screened for increased mRNA expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ following stimulation	1
4996	Although all tested immortalized feline cell lines expressed @GENE$ ( data not shown ) , they failed to respond to stimulation with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown )	1
4997	However , this molecule exhibited potent immunomodulatory properties in feline PBMCs : when measured 24 h post stimulation , a concentration of only 1 μg / mL ODN 2216 was sufficient to enhance transcription of @GENE$ by 40 - fold , and a maximum induction of this gene was observed when 4 μg / mL ODN were used ( Figure 3C )	1
4998	Although affected in a similar pattern , the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine @GENE$ remained comparatively low at all concentrations tested ( Figure 3D )	1
4999	In experiments foreseen to determine gene expression kinetics in feline cells after stimulation with the ODN 2216 molecule , an influence on @GENE$ transcription could be measured as early as 3 h after treatment of PBMCs , whereas increased levels of @GENE$ were observed only as of 6 h post stimulation ( Figure 3E and F )	1
5000	Notably , the highest induction of both genes was measured 24 h after addition of ODN 2216 to the cultures , with transcription increasing by 9000 - fold and 39fold at this time point for @GENE$ and @GENE$ respectively ( Figure 3E and F )	1
5001	The observed effects were specifically conferred by the @GENE$ comprised in the 2216 ODN , since specific control ODN 2243 only induced slight elevations in the expression of the genes tested ( Figure 3C - F )	1
5002	Importantly , trypan blue exclusion experiments indicated no evidence of cellular toxicity after treatment neither with ODN 2216 nor with ODN 2243 at all concentrations tested ( data not shown ) .	1
5003	Reports of anti - HIV - 1 @GENE$ delivery via CPPs come from Pandey ' s [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and Gait ' s [ 95 ] groups which have been working on antivirals targeting highly - conserved @GENE$ of the @GENE$ critical for its replication and gene expression , such as the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
5004	In their studies , the authors designed @GENE$ directed against these regions to inhibit HIV - 1 gene expression and replication ( Figure 1 ) .	1
5005	While studying the delivery of anti - HSV - 1 antivirals using a peptide derived from @GENE$ signal peptide , Bultmann et al	1
5006	found that the peptide itself exerted antiviral activity [ 107 ]	1
5007	This discovery led them to investigate the intrinsic antiviral properties of a range of peptides against HSV - 1 infection in cultured cells	1
5008	Tested peptides included EB ( stands for entry blocker ; it is a modified @GENE$ signal peptide ) , @GENE$ , KLA ( a synthetic amphipatic peptide ) , and HOM ( derived from @GENE$ ) , and their modified peptides [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ]	1
5009	In particular , a @GENE$ peptide containing a cysteine residue at its @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was shown to be able to inhibit infection in three ways : irreversibly inactivating virions exposed to @GENE$ prior to cell infection , blocking entry of cell - adsorbed viruses , and inducing a state of resistance to infection in cells pretreated with @GENE$ ( Figure 1 ) [ 109 ]	1
5010	Mechanisms of antiviral activities have not been determined yet but @GENE$ seems to act by inhibiting viral entry at the fusion step rather than at the virus attachment step	1
5011	Virion inactivation may result from @GENE$ binding to sialic acids on the @GENE$ .	1
5012	No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed .	1
5013	ZIKV - specific functional cellular and humoral responses elicited by the ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine in non - human primates NHPs were immunised by intradermal immunisation using intradermal electroporation , based on recent studies showing potent immune responses in a intradermal format	1
5014	19 , 20 Rhesus macaques ( RM ; n = 5 / group ) were administered 2	1
5015	0 mg of @GENE$ plasmid intradermally with electroporation , with each animal vaccinated twice 4 weeks apart	1
5016	The sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were collected at day 0 ( preimmunisation ) and week 6 ( 2 weeks post second immunisation )	1
5017	ELISpot analysis of pre - immunisation and week 6 PBMCs ex vivo stimulated with the ZIKV - prME peptide pools showed that ZIKV - prME immunisation induced robust anti - ZIKV T cell responses in RM ( Figure 4a ) .	1
5018	We also define these values as 0 when their denominators are 0	1
5019	When a prediction agrees with the reference structure , the value of F - measure is equal to 1 ( so are the values of sensitivity and PPV )	1
5020	When the values of sensitivity or PPV is equal to 0 , the predicted structure does not have any @GENE$ in common with the reference structure .	1
5021	Epidemic predictions in an imperfect world : modelling disease spread with partial data	1
5022	In the yeast two - hybrid screen , only one protein , @GENE$ , was identified to be a potential binding protein for @GENE$ ( Figure 1A )	1
5023	To confirm the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) pulldown assay was performed with the @GENE$ expressed in Escherichia coli and the @GENE$ expressed in HEK293T cells	1
5024	The results showed that @GENE$ but not @GENE$ interacts with @GENE$ ( Figure 1B )	1
5025	To further verify the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ , coimmunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
5026	After incubation with @GENE$ ( MAb ) and Protein G - Agarose , the @GENE$ was found to coprecipitate with the @GENE$ ( Figure 1C )	1
5027	Furthermore , the @GENE$ was shown to coprecipitate with @GENE$ when the cell lysate was incubated with @GENE$ and @GENE$ - Agarose ( Figure 1D )	1
5028	Considering that both @GENE$ and @GENE$ show a strong affinity for nucleic acids , we investigated whether the NS5A @GENE$ interaction might be mediated through a nonspecific RNA bridge	1
5029	The results showed that the NS5A @GENE$ interaction was not influenced by @GENE$ treatment , indicating that the interaction is not due to nonspecific RNA - mediated binding ( Figure 1E )	1
5030	To examine the colocalization of @GENE$ with @GENE$ , the subcellular localization of @GENE$ and @GENE$ was examined by confocal microscopy	1
5031	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ were colocalized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1F )	1
5032	Taken together , the results demonstrated that @GENE$ is an interacting partner of the CSFV NS5A protein .	1
5033	We analyzed 193 samples from Desmodus rotundus to test whether temporal variation ( season and year ) and individual risk factors ( e	1
5034	g	1
5035	, age , sex ) explain differences in @DISEASE$ , using generalized mixed effects models ( GLMMs ) with binomial errors and a logit link fit with the lme4 package in R [ 59 , 60 ]	1
5036	We fit a single GLMM with an interaction between site and year to first test if prevalence varied over years across sampling locations ; we excluded one site from this analysis ( i	1
5037	e	1
5038	, LR6 ) owing to sampling in only 2015	1
5039	We included bat identification number ( ID ) as a random effect to account for multiple sampling of a small number of bats ( n = 6 )	1
5040	To assess seasonality in infection , we fit a separate GLMM with season ( spring , summer , fall ) as a predictor to data from two sites in Peru ( AM1 and CA1 ) sampled across seasons ( n = 63 )	1
5041	We also fit a generalized additive model ( GAM ) with restricted maximum likelihood , binomial response , and a cyclic cubic regression spline for Julian date using the mgcv package [ 61 ]	1
5042	We randomly selected repeatedly sampled bats , as including bat ID as a random effect here overfit the GAM .	1
5043	@DISEASE$ of @DISEASE$ induce@GENE$ s mediating monocyte recruitment	1
5044	Considering that the establishment of innate immune responses by virus - infected cells may also involve the production o@GENE$ s responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection , we measured the gene expression of severa@GENE$ s in JEV - infected porcine @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
5045	6 )	1
5046	mRNA expression le@GENE$ of@GENE$  , CCL@GENE$  CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi compared to those in mock controls ( Fig	1
5047	6A to C )	1
5048	Nevertheles@GENE$ or CCL2 , only JEV Laos induced a significant mRNA upregulation at 48 hpi ( Fig	1
5049	6A ) .	1
5050	Because @GENE$ are expressed not only in C	1
5051	perfringens but also in human lysosomes ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) , cytosol ( @GENE$ ) and membranes ( @GENE$ ) , diplacone could cause undesirable effects in humans because it may inhibit @GENE$	1
5052	To predict how diplacone would interact with @GENE$ counterparts , we modelled @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) using the previously determined @GENE$ structure and compared the specificity of diplacone with C	1
5053	perfringens and @GENE$ ( Fig	1
5054	4a and Supplementary Fig	1
5055	S2 )	1
5056	The @GENE$ with bound diplacone was superimposed with the crystal structure of @GENE$ with bound 2 - deoxy - 2 , 3 - dehydro - N - acetylneuraminic acid ( @GENE$ ) and models of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ that were constructed using @GENE$ as a template	1
5057	The geranyl group of diplacone is essential for inhibition of the bacterial enzyme as it occupies a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe353 , Thr487 and Tyr587	1
5058	In @GENE$ the corresponding residues are polar and would not interact favourably with the geranyl group ( Fig	1
5059	4b ) .	1
5060	Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated , intracellular catabolic mechanism that is essential for maintaining homeostasis and coping with nutrient starvation	1
5061	It is increasingly appreciated that autophagy can be highly selective , and that xenophagy , the selective autophagy of pathogens , is an important aspect of the immune response , which protects against infection	1
5062	A vast array of viruses are associated with autophagy , and we have found several @GENE$ containing putative @GENE$ that are thought to interact with the autophagic machinery via @GENE$	1
5063	A continued research effort to better understand how these @GENE$ interact with the autophagic machinery may provide therapeutic strategies and ultimately lead to the discovery of novel pharmacological agents to fight @DISEASE$ .	1
5064	We use three data sets to analyze performance of our algorithms	1
5065	Our first data set is the test data set of Andronescu et al	1
5066	[ 36 ] , that contains 446 distinct @GENE$ and their reference structures , of which 348 are pseudoknotfree and 98 are pseudoknotted	1
5067	This set has four structures that are not in the class of structures our methods can handle ( i	1
5068	e	1
5069	, have densities higher than 2 [ 48 ] )	1
5070	Since the number of such structures is too small to be useful in an experimental analysis , we removed them from our set of @GENE$ , resulting in a set of size 442 .	1
5071	HFold : Given an @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and a @GENE$ input structure , @GENE$ , find a pseudoknot - free structure , G such that G ∪ G is the lowest energy structure that contains G	1
5072	We note that G ∪ G might not be pseudoknotted .	1
5073	Method : The bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS - 2B and HBEc14 - KT were cultured and then treated with PGE 2	1
5074	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and a PDK1 inhibitor , an antagonist of the @GENE$ receptor subtype @GENE$ and @GENE$ , @GENE$ siRNA , and overexpressions of @GENE$ and @GENE$ have been used to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation .	1
5075	@GENE$ have three @GENE$ , an adjacent pair ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) close to the @GENE$ and a third ( @GENE$ ) towards the @GENE$ , separated from @GENE$ and @GENE$ by an intervening sequence of variable length ( Figure 3D )	1
5076	To test the involvement of individual @GENE$ in @GENE$ EASE$ , amino acid substitutions ( to GDDG ) were introduced within the conserved , hal@GENE$  loop in each domain , which forms part o@GENE$ omain	1
5077	These mutations have been shown previously to abolish RNA bind - ing activity of the individual domain without compromising its stability ( 37 )	1
5078	As shown in Figure 5A and B , mutation o@GENE$ oma@GENE$ PCB@GENE$ PCBP2 had little , if any , effect on frameshifting , wherea@GENE$ e KH3 domain mutation essentially abolished trans - activation @GENE$ e KH1 domain mutation had a more varied phenotype .@GENE$ PCBP1 , frameshift - stimulation was greatly reduced , bu@GENE$ PCBP2 @GENE$ 2 PRF was diminished four - fold , but full activity i@GENE$ 1 PRF was retained	1
5079	Further , whilst additi@GENE$  KH@GENE$  KH3m alone was unable to stim@GENE$ e PRF , when ( A ) EMSA analysis of bindi@GENE$  nsp1 [U@GENE$ PCB@GENE$ PCBP2 ( alone or in combination ) to a short ( 58@GENE$ cript containing the @GENE$ V PRF signal	1
5080	After incubation at 30 • C for 10 min , reactions were loaded onto a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel and , following electrophoresis , the gel was fixed , dried and subjected to autoradiography	1
5081	Numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of protein ( s ) with respect to the radiolabelled RNA ( 10 nM )	1
5082	In lanes BSB , DB and W , RNA was incubated alone with band - shift buffer , protein dilution buffer or water , respectively ( see ' Materials and Methods ' section )	1
5083	( B ) The compositi@GENE$ lexes was investigated by supershift assay	1
5084	Complexes were prepared with 10 nM RNA and a 50 - fold molar exce@GENE$  nsp1 [UNK] ( N @GENE$ PC@GENE$ 2 ( P ) and subjected to EMSA directly ( N , P2 , NP2 ) , or after incubation with monoclonal ( mono ) or polyclonal ( poly ) antisera raised against PCBP2 ( ␣ P2 , mono ) or nsp1 ␤ ( ␣ N , mono or poly )	1
5085	As controls , the radiolabelled RNA probe was incubated with either DB , the ␣ P2 mono or the ␣ N poly	1
5086	added together , a partial restoration of both − 2 and − 1 PRF ( to about 20 % of the WT value ) was observed ( Figure 5C )	1
5087	Note that in all assays , frameshift - stimulation remained dependent upon addition of nsp1 ␤ ( Figure 5D ) .	1
5088	This review focused on the SARs epidemic in Canada , specifically Toronto , Ontario ; to represent an epidemic in a high income country	1
5089	Table 2 summarizes the search results .	1
5090	The governing equations for the carrier phase and the discrete phase were solved by using a finite - volume based code , ANSYS ( version 12	1
5091	1	1
5092	4 )	1
5093	In the transient simulation , the interaction between the discrete phase and the continuous phase was also considered as the external body forces and computed during the continuous phase iterations [ 22 ]	1
5094	The particles were tracked using the Lagrangian method along with the flow equations at the end of each time step	1
5095	The Re - Normalization Group ( RNG ) k - ε model was used for modeling the turbulence in this computational geometry due to its good accuracy , computing efficiency , robustness and affordability [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]	1
5096	The Differential Viscosity Model and the Swirl Dominated Flow in the RNG options were also used	1
5097	An enhanced two - layer wall treatment was employed for the prediction of aerosol deposition [ 24 ]	1
5098	Wall unit adaptation was applied in wall - adjacent cells when creating the meshes to ensure that the values of the wall unit y + meet the requirements of the enhanced wall treatment [ 22 ]	1
5099	The turbulent dispersion and the random walking of the aerosols are also considered by using the Thermophoretic Force and the Brownian Motion options in the DPM model	1
5100	To simulate human movement , the layering meshing scheme of the dynamic mesh method was used [ 13 , 17 , 28 ]	1
5101	The whole mesh domain was split into two mesh zones : stationary zone and dynamic zone [ 11 ] , as shown in Figure 1	1
5102	The surfaces between the static mesh zone and the dynamic mesh zone are set as grid interfaces	1
5103	The grid sizes on the two sides of the interfaces are different	1
5104	The maximum mesh size for the static mesh zones and the dynamic mesh zones is 0	1
5105	03 m and 0	1
5106	05 m , respectively	1
5107	The data exchange in the interface between the static and @GENE$ was realized by the grid interface principles for the sliding mesh theory [ 11 ]	1
5108	The semi - implicit method for pressure - linked equations ( SIMPLE ) algorithm was employed to solve the pressure - velocity coupling equations in the steady - state	1
5109	The Pressure - Implicit with Splitting of Operators ( PISO ) algorithm was employed for transient simulation	1
5110	The second order upwind scheme was used for the treatment of the convection and diffusion - convection terms in the governing equation	1
5111	The method used to simulate human movement has been verified by experimental and numerical investigations [ 29 ] .	1
5112	Unlike the nasopharynx , the presence of any pathogens in the tracheal aspirates represents infection in the lower respiratory tract rather than carriage in the upper airway	1
5113	Both pathogens are known to cause @DISEASE$ on their own and both are not commonly carried by healthy young persons [ 5 , 13 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
5114	These facts support the argument that they were copathogens with pneumococcus which was found in pleural fluid , tracheal aspirates , and blood	1
5115	In conclusion , the simultaneous isolations of 3 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens have not been reported in our locality and may contribute to the fatal outcome of this unfortunate child .	1
5116	To provide some sensitivity analysis to estimate the effectiveness of source control , two other scenarios with lower and higher source control capabilities were also analysed	1
5117	In the lower source control scenario ( scenario 3	1
5118	1 ) it was assumed a reduction of 80 % for radon , CO and SHS and 25 % reduction of PM 2	1
5119	5 , VOC and dampness exposures	1
5120	In the higher source control scenario ( scenario 3	1
5121	2 ) a total control ( 100 % ) of radon , CO and SHS and 75 % reduction of PM 2	1
5122	5 , VOC and dampness exposures were assumed .	1
5123	The methods are based on relatively simplistic tools ( both the mass - balance exposure model and the risk / health impact model )	1
5124	However , I think they are appropriate for the type of analysis presented in the paper .	1
5125	This paper attempts to understand optimal ventilation rates at the national level across 26 European countries and to contrast the benefits of optimizing ventilation with filtration of outdoor air pollution and control of indoor sources	1
5126	This is an important topic given the key role of the housing sector in tackling both air pollution and climate change	1
5127	Although the methods used are relatively simplistic , they are appropriate for analyses performed at the scale presented in the paper	1
5128	The findings and conclusions are well supported by the results	1

5130	However , I believe the manuscript would benefit from a stronger statement of the aims of the work and some clarifications regarding the methods ( see below ) .	1
5131	Detection of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) using isothermal amplification of @GENE$ 	1
5132	@GENE$ and inhibition of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 also substantially reduced or eliminated enhanced transcytosis ( Figure S3D - F ) , as did competition between the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ ( Figure S3G )	1
5133	Consistent with other investigations of Fc @GENE$ interactions , maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5	1

5138	Since @GENE$ binds to @GENE$ and not to @GENE$ , we compared two different @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , with their @GENE$ - switched versions	1
5139	Both @GENE$ enhanced transcytosis of HIV - 1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL - p at pH 6	1
5140	0 , whereas the @GENE$ class - switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D )	1
5141	In fact , as reported , @GENE$ inhibited transcytosis [ 40 ]	1
5142	Thus , enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by @GENE$ and is dependent on @GENE$ .	1

5207	Data from Banfield Pet Hospital ® visits between 2008 and 2012 showed that older cats are more highly represented among cases of @DISEASE$ ( 8 )	1
5208	Because of this , it was considered that age may have been associated with more severe clinical disease ; however , no significant correlation was observed between age and vomiting occurrence within this study population	1
5209	Previous studies evaluating diagnostic outcomes of cats with @DISEASE$ have shown that older cats ( mean ages ranging from 9	1
5210	3 to 12	1
5211	6 years ) were more likely to have an underlying neoplastic etiology compared to younger populations ( mean age 7	1
5212	7 - 8	1
5213	9 years ) ( 13 , 14 )	1
5214	The population in this present study was relatively younger ( mean age of 7	1
5215	2 years ) and likely had less severe disease than those evaluated in previous studies at tertiary referral practices	1
5216	Given the risk of underlying @DISEASE$ in cats with @DISEASE$ , dietary intervention in conjunction with additional diagnostics is warranted in older patients .	1
5217	This survey was conducted between August 2015 and February 2016 after the last @DISEASE$ case diagnosed in July 5 , 2015	1
5218	Based on a database of quarantined individuals provided by the Department of Epidemiologic Investigation of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) , individuals from 4 regions with major outbreaks - Seoul , Gyeonggi , Chungcheong , and Jeonbuk - were selected	1
5219	Individuals whose @DISEASE$ status was diagnosed as positive using a polymerase chain reaction test were excluded from the analysis of this study	1
5220	From the 14 , 831 quarantined individuals , 7 , 233 residents ( 48	1
5221	8 % ) living in the 4 major @DISEASE$ outbreak regions were selected	1
5222	Of these individuals , calls requesting participation in this study were made to 3 , 291 individuals ( 45	1
5223	5 % ) according to prioritization groupings	1
5224	A total of 1 , 610 individuals ( 48	1
5225	9 % ) ultimately participated in the study ( Figure 1 )	1
5226	Those who refused to participate have been described in another study [ 20 ] .	1
5227	Traditional antiviral therapy has relied on small molecules such as protease inhibitors or nucleotide analogues to inhibit @GENE$	1
5228	In the last decades , proteins and nucleic acid molecules have shown very promising antiviral properties	1
5229	However , due to their physical properties , such as size or hydrophilicity , the cellular uptake of these molecules is strongly restricted	1
5230	The inability of these molecules to cross the cell membrane to reach their intracellular target precludes further clinical application	1
5231	The cellular delivery of these molecules has thus arisen as a cornerstone for therapeutic development .	1
5232	We reasoned that if ADP - ribosylation is the focus of a host - virus conflict , we might see evolutionary signatures of positive ( diversifying ) selection acting on the specific @GENE$ involved	1
5233	Positive selection is a hallmark of @GENE$ locked in genetic conflict with viruses that counter - evolve to evade the host antiviral defenses , and has been seen in both @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 34 ]	1
5234	Positive selection is characterized by the accumulation of amino acid - altering , nonsynonymous changes in the DNA at a rate that is greater than the accumulation of neutral , synonymous changes	1
5235	When such protein changes are recurrently selected for ( due to their adaptive advantage ) , the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates exceeds one ( dN / dS	1
5236	1 , where dN is the nonsynonymous substitution rate and dS is the synonymous substitution rate )	1
5237	Such analyses can not only identify a gene that has evolved under positive selection but can also pinpoint domains and even individual codons within that gene located at the direct interface between @GENE$ [ 35 , 36 ]	1
5238	We previously analyzed @GENE$ to determine if the direct antiviral activity of @GENE$ has led to a genetic conflict with viruses	1
5239	Indeed , consistent with its antiviral function , we found a robust signature of positive selection in @GENE$ in primates [ 37 ]	1
5240	Interestingly , despite the fact that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ directly bind @GENE$ [ 27 ] , we found no signature of positive selection in these domains	1
5241	Instead , we found sites of positive selection in the @GENE$ , implying that this domain is a target for genetic conflict with viruses [ 37 ]	1
5242	Although this domain in @GENE$ appears to lack catalytic activity [ 4 ] , we nevertheless found that its removal from @GENE$ decreased the level of viral restriction [ 37 ] , arguing that some function of the @GENE$ remains intact	1
5243	Thus , using an evolutionary signature of positive selection as a guide , we were able to identify a domain important for the antiviral activity of @GENE$ .	1
5244	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ stimulate @GENE$ and @GENE$ catalytic activity ( k cat ) without increasing substrate binding affinity ( K m ; Faesen et al	1
5245	, 2011 ; Dharadhar et al	1
5246	, 2016 ; Li et al	1
5247	, 2016 ) , suggesting that the @GENE$ may affect DUB activity via a novel structural mechanism	1
5248	Three recent studies provide crystal structures of the @GENE$ in complex with @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
5249	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were each crystallized bound to @GENE$ ( Yin et al	1
5250	, 2015 ; Dharadhar et al	1
5251	, 2016 ; Li et al	1
5252	, 2016 ) , and @GENE$ was also crystalized in a ternary complex with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Li et al	1
5253	, 2016 )	1
5254	@GENE$ and @GENE$ bind the @GENE$ relatively far from the catalytic cleft and stimulate DUB catalytic activity via allosteric mechanisms ( Figure 1 ; Yin et al	1
5255	, 2015 ; Dharadhar et al	1
5256	, 2016 ; Li et al	1
5257	, 2016 )	1
5258	@GENE$ and @GENE$ exhibit the conserved @GENE$ structure comprised of @GENE$ , with the catalytic triad of cysteine , histidine and aspartic acid , nestled in between the @GENE$ | Model of @GENE$ bound to @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
5259	This model is inferred from a combination of structures of @GENE$ bound to @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Yin et al	1
5260	, 2015 ) and @GENE$ bound to @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Li et al	1
5261	, 2016 )	1
5262	@GENE$ , @GENE$ ; @GENE$ , @GENE$ ; @GENE$ , @GENE$ of @GENE$ ; Cys , @GENE$ .	1
5263	@GENE$ have been proposed to block hemifusion , the process whereby the outer , but not the inner , leaflet of the viral and cellular membranes merge [ 17 ] , possibly through the modulation of the intracellular levels of cholesterol , a particular intriguing hypothesis given that @GENE$ interacts with the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , a key component in cholesterol homeostasis [ 25 ]	1
5264	The exact mechanism of antiviral inhibition by @GENE$ remains however unclear , given that a recent study indicated that @GENE$ inhibits the transition from hemifusion to pore formation rather than hemifusion itself , in a cholesterol - independent manner [ 26 ] .	1
5265	The principal target cells of infection in rodents ( and humans ) are the microvasculature endothelial cells of many tissues [ 39 ]	1
5266	Experimental intramuscular infection of deer mice with @DISEASE$ resulted in detectable virus in the lungs as few as two days later [ 13 ]	1
5267	Many organs appeared infected , although infection was limited to the vasculature within those tissues	1
5268	Two infectious outcomes occur in experimentally infected deer mice ; a disseminated infection of three or more organs , or a restricted infection of the lungs and heart [ 40 ]	1
5269	The relevance of these two patterns to transmission efficiency is unknown	1
5270	The leve@GENE$ l RNA vary dramatically in infected deer mice , with most having modest to moderate levels of RNA at the peak of infection	1
5271	However , some deer mice have significantly greater amoun@GENE$ l RNA , suggesting these deer mice may produce substantially more virus than others , and it is possible they transmit virus more efficiently ( e	1
5272	g	1
5273	, " supershedders " ) [ 13 ]	1
5274	This also occurs in semi - natural transmission experiments [ 9 ] and suggests certain individuals may have a prominent role in population - level transmission of @DISEASE$ .	1
5275	A total of 200 children with @DISEASE$ were enrolled over 1 year period from August 2014 to July 2015	1
5276	Fig 1 demonstrates the month - wise rate of specimen collection from enrolled patients	1
5277	The rate of specimen collection reached a peak in September ( 30 % ; 60 / 200 ) ) , followed by a sharp decline in October ( 6	1
5278	5 % ; n = 13 )	1
5279	After October , a gradual increase in the rate of specimen collection was observed during the months of November , December , and January , with the rate of 8 % ( n = 16 ) , 10 % ( n = 20 ) , and 16 % ( n = 32 ) , respectively .	1
5280	Canine @DISEASE$ ( CaKoV ) is an emerging pathogen in Thailand	1
5281	To the best of our knowledge , the @DISEASE$ was described in Asia in retrospective study in Korea in 2011 and have been reported in Japan , China and Australia , respectively [ 2 , 15 , 17 , 21 ]	1
5282	However , the @DISEASE$ have never been reported in the country or South East Asia region	1
5283	In this study , during the 2 year - survey program , we found CaKoV positivity at 17	1
5284	59 % in both sick ( 19	1
5285	44 % ) and healthy ( 9	1
5286	09 % ) animals	1
5287	Compare to other studies , CaKoV % positivity in this study was lower than those in China ( 54 % ) and Korea ( 32	1
5288	2 % ) [ 14 , 22 ]	1
5289	Our result showed that the CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 27 % which consistence with previous reports [ 15 ]	1
5290	Similar to other previous studies , co - infections with other enteric viral pathogens were observed such as CaKoV / Canine parvovirus and CaKoV / Canine Coronavirus [ 12 , 14 , 15 ]	1
5291	Moreover , CaKoVs were detected in both diarrheic and non - diarrheic dogs which consistent with other studies [ 2 , 15 ]	1
5292	Our result supported that this virus may not be the only cause of @DISEASE$ in dogs	1
5293	Nevertheless , the @DISEASE$ infection have still been identified in symptomatic dogs without other enteric pathogen infections [ 12 ]	1
5294	Our observation supported that the role of CaKoV as a primary pathogen of @DISEASE$ remain unclear .	1
5295	A fast and robust iterative algorithm for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures	1
5296	( 4 ) ( 1 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) developed multiplex qPCR assays for two squirrel species indicates that developing multiplex qPCR assays for multiple pathogens in other wildlife species should be relatively straightforward	1
5297	A clear benefit is that , since much of the optimisation and validation is carried out in multiplex , there is relatively little additional work required to develop assays that screen for more than one pathogen ; moreover , multiplex reactions increase the amount of data gained from a single sample , and incorporating an endogenous IC into the design provides confidence in the reliability of the ( negative ) results and allows comparison of results across laboratories	1
5298	Therefore , any disadvantage of additional initial investment into assay development is quickly outweighed by the greater quantity and quality of data produced	1
5299	Overall , the new assays identified similar findings to the previously published methods	1
5300	Our SQPV assays and the Atkin et al	1
5301	( 2010 ) SYBR ® green assay both identified @DISEASE$ a localised infection in grey squirrels , compared with the generalised , systemic infection in red squirrels	1
5302	The agreement between available TEM data and our qPCR assays for SADV was moderate ( k value = 0	1
5303	39 ) , but this level of agreement is nonetheless superior to that reported in studies using conventional PCR	1
5304	Grey squirrel SADV results are reasonably comparable to previous studies reporting infection prevalence of spleen and blood samples as 54 - 57 and 0 - 7 % ( Everest et al	1
5305	2014 ) in comparison to 33 and 50 % reported here	1
5306	The difference in prevalence of @DISEASE$ in blood samples may reflect the increased sensitivity of the qPCR assay developed , with the level of SADV in blood generally low , and thus potentially overlooked when screening with conventional PCR	1
5307	However , differences in selection , geography and time of year may also have been responsible for or contributed to the data obtained	1
5308	In red squirrels , SADV is believed to be an @DISEASE$ although systemic effects are witnessed , with @DISEASE$ commonly reported ( Martinez - Jimenez et al	1
5309	2011 ; Sainsbury et al	1
5310	2001 )	1
5311	This is supported by our data , with the gastrointestinal tract , liver , blood and spleen showing the highest intensities and prevalence of SADV infection .	1
5312	@DISEASE$ infection also appears to be localised in grey squirrels , with the highest level of infection detected in rectal swab samples ( RQ mean = 0	1

5318	2c )	1
5319	However , tissue samples from the gastrointestinal tract ( i	1

5329	Interestingly , values of RQ in the spleen were somewhat higher ( RQ mean = 0	1

5333	18 - 0	1

5335	The findings in the spleen are also complemented with a high proportion of viral presence in the blood ( 0	1

5337	42 - 0	1
5338	99 CI , n = 7 ) all - be - it with relatively low quantity of virus ( RQ mean = 0	1

5346	The crucial role these various mechanisms play in determining @DISEASE$ is demonstrated by contrasting M	1

5348	pneumoniae	1
5349	Similar to S	1
5350	pneumoniae , M	1
5351	catarrhalis is a primary carriage species estimated to colonize between 31 % and 50 % of children < 2 years in the USA [ 45 ] and frequently causes @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$	1
5352	However , unlike S	1
5353	pneumoniae , M	1
5354	catarrhalis rarely causes @DISEASE$ [ 46 ] , suggesting that differences in mechanisms of pathogenicity may be the explanation .	1
5355	Bacterial , fungal , and mycobacterial cultures of endotracheal aspirates and BAL fluid were performed	1

5373	Using the amended 1918 @DISEASE$ virus as a reference and including all human and porcine viruses in the database , we calculated SNPs , indels , transitions , transversions , non - synonymous amino acid changes , dN / dS ratios , predicted protein lengths ( for all 11 proteins ) , the normalized codon scores ( NCS ) and relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) [ 51 ] score for each predicted protein of each genome	1

5380	If only limited resources are available for data collection , it may be more efficient to record movements only from the most highly connected farms ( the TNS method ) or to use SBS ( the SBS method )	1
5381	The TNS method proves significantly more effective than both the RMS and RNS methods when markets do not contribute to transmission - less than 20 % of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to predict epidemic sizes to within 90 % confidence in the UK for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria , Devon and Aberdeenshire	1
5382	The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease , the size of the epidemic peak and the epidemic duration	1
5383	When markets contribute towards disease amplification , the TNS method requires that around 30 % of all nodes would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes	1
5384	The SBS method is found to perform less effectively than the TNS method , as this strategy rapidly identifies the most highly connected nodes that are likely to contribute most significantly to disease transmission	1
5385	However , the SBS method may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network .	1
5386	Most serological assays for detecting antibody responses in @DISEASE$ reservoirs use virus neutralization , ELISA or strip immunoblotting [ 12 , 29 , [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]	1
5387	While some of these assays are I@GENE$  specific , others use antiserum to whole I@GENE$  including the l@GENE$  Since l@GENE$ re shared by all i@GENE$  these detection antibodies are not I@GENE$  specific	1
5388	Moreover , no assays are in place for detecting I@GENE$  which should be prominent in @DISEASE$	1
5389	IgM assays@GENE$ e been problematic despite the availability of anti - IgM captur@GENE$ tisera that are cross - reactive with IgM from a@GENE$ ast one @DISEASE$ reservoir species [ 44 ]	1
5390	Some immunoglobu@GENE$ es with specific effector activities , such as complement fixation or antibody - dependent cell cytotoxicity	1
5391	Laboratory house mice have four IgG isotype@GENE$ G2@GENE$ gG@GENE$  I@GENE$ It i@GENE$ ely that reservoirs also have immunoglobu@GENE$ ct effector functions and which might predominate during @DISEASE$	1
5392	These reagent deficiencies are a current obstacle for assessing antibody responses in rodent reservoir hosts	1
5393	Despite these limitations , many field studies have been conducted examining antibody responses in natural and semi - natural @DISEASE$ infections of rodent reservoirs [ 34 , [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] .	1
5394	In conclusion , we found that @GENE$ encoded by different @GENE$ display different immunoreactivity to @GENE$	1
5395	Our data show the @GENE$ and @GENE$ have the major @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
5396	More importantly , our study verify that the @GENE$ and @GENE$ can be used to construct a double antigen sandwich lateral - flow immunochromatographic anti - HCV immunoassay strip	1
5397	This strip allows for the more rapid and more economical detection of @DISEASE$	1
5398	It also has a high sensitivity and specificity in testing for @DISEASE$	1
5399	It has the potential to become a useful tool for @DISEASE$ clinical detection .	1

5409	The severity of the episode was classified as mild in 340 cases ( 56 % ) , moderate in 237 ( 39 % ) , and severe in 26 ( 4 % ) , while none of the episodes was classified as lifethreatening .	1
5410	Carrageenan - induced mouse paw oedema is frequently used to determine the anti - inflammatory activity of diverse bioactive compounds such as plant extracts and essential oils [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ]	1
5411	If this method allows screening the anti - inflammatory of samples , very little information is given about its mechanism .	1
5412	The anti - inflammatory effects of diverse combination of thyme ( p - cymene and thymol as main components ) and oregano ( carvacrol as major component ) oils on mice with @GENE$ ASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ showed that some combinations lowered the amou@GENE$ L - 1β and @GENE$ okines [ 124 ] .	1
5413	The patients were included in this study when they 1 ) were admitted for @DISEASE$ treatment ; and 2 ) had viral polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) tests performed on the upper respiratory specimen	1
5414	The exclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) a respiratory viral PCR test was not performed ; 2 ) they had incomplete records ; 3 ) they were immediately transferred to a tertiary hospital for advanced care ; and 4 ) the primary reason for admission was to manage comorbid diseases .	1
5415	The camera allows video sequences to be recorded and played back at reduced frame rates or frame by frame	1
5416	@GENE$ is calculated by the observer timing a given number of individual cilia beat cycles using the following equation : Frame rate ( number of frames / sec ) / 5 ( frames elapsed for five ciliary beat cycles ) × 5 ( conversion per beat cycle ) .	1
5417	According to the synthetic procedure for 2 , 5 - Amino - 1 - ( 4 - heptyl ) - 1 , 2 - dihydropyrazol - 3 - one was prepared by the reaction of 4 - heptanone and 2 - cyanoacetyl hydrazide , which yielded the desired pyrazolone after reduction with sodium borohydride	1

5426	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is one of the most serious threats for the swine industry worldwide	1
5427	It is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the pig intestine	1
5428	Colistin , a cationic antibiotic , is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of @DISEASE$ , and particularly of @DISEASE$	1
5429	However , despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of @DISEASE$ , several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant E	1
5430	coli in swine	1
5431	Furthermore , this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans , being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug - resistant ( MDR ) Gram - negative bacteria ( GNB )	1
5432	Moreover , the recent discovery of the mcr - 1 gene encoding for c@GENE$ tance in Enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid @GENE$ out the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of @DISEASE$ in humans	1
5433	Consequently , it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only	1
5434	Thus , to overcome the economic losses , which would result from the restriction of use of colistin , especially for prophylactic purposes in @DISEASE$ control , we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of @DISEASE$ in swine is crucial	1
5435	Such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance	1
5436	The present review begins with an overview of risk factors of @DISEASE$ and an update of colistin use in @DISEASE$ control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes	1
5437	Subsequently , alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed	1
5438	Finally , a practical approach for the control of @DISEASE$ in its various phases is proposed .	1
5439	Samples were collected in the first 48 hours of patient hospitalization	1
5440	Nasal swabs were taken from all @DISEASE$ cases and controls	1
5441	To document antibiotic usage history , urine was sampled from cases for broad spectrum antibiotic detection	1
5442	Whole blood and pleural effusions ( in applicable cases ) were collected from cases only	1
5443	Whole blood was distributed in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) vials for preservation and in dry tubes for serum specimens	1
5444	EDTA - whole blood samples allowed complete blood count , blood culture and real - time multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b	1
5445	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were measured quantitatively in serum .	1
5446	The development of both feline medicine and more sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques such as serological and molecular methods has led in recent decades to an increasing number of documented case reports of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and subclinical infections	1
5447	However , there is still limited information on epidemiological and clinical aspects of @DISEASE$ in cats which is all derived from descriptive studies , case reports , information from canine @DISEASE$ cases and personal experience of respected experts	1
5448	This means that the current quality of evidence supporting any recommendation on @DISEASE$ is low ( grade IV ) [ 8 ] .	1
5449	We explored the signature of adaptive evolution in @GENE$ of @GENE$ in more detail by sequencing @GENE$ from @GENE$ from additional primates ( Table S1 )	1
5450	Analysis of a total of 15 primate PARP4 @GENE$ sequences confirmed our initial screening results that this region has evolved under positive selection ( PAML p - value , 0	1
5451	0001 , PARRIS p - value , 0	1
5452	01 ) ( Figure S2A and Alignment S1 )	1
5453	These analyses also identified several @GENE$ within @GENE$ that display dramatic signatures of recurrent positive selection ( Table S4 )	1
5454	For instance , despite being in close proximity in the primary sequence to @GENE$ that are strictly conserved across primates , @GENE$ has undergone at least six amino acid changes during approximately 45 million years of simian primate evolution , with a calculated dN / dS ratio	1
5455	3 ( Figure 2C ) .	1
5456	Glucocorticoids	1
5457	Glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT , and low doses combined with other immunosuppressants are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation	1
5458	In case of @DISEASE$ , recipients receive pulse methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection	1
5459	There are convincing data that bolus doses of glucocorticoids given for rejection treatment have a negative impact on @DISEASE$ recurrence	1
5460	It is estimated that cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality , higher levels of @DISEASE$ , and more severe histological recurrence [ 34 ]	1
5461	One recent study demonstrated that glucocorticosteroids specifically increased HCV entry by upregulating the cell entry factors oc@GENE$ d sc@GENE$ The data suggested that the potential effects of high - dose glucocorticosteroids on @DISEASE$ in vivo may be due to increased @DISEASE$ dissemination [ 35 ]	1
5462	Previous studies have indicated that the specific @GENE$ T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$	1
5463	Moreover , plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against @DISEASE$ @GENE$ ction in this specific CD4 T cell response [ 36 , 37 ]	1
5464	Experimental data have shown that prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis [ 38 ]	1
5465	Thus , in a transplant setting , the consensus is that steroid avoidance or slow tapering of the dose is associated with reduced @DISEASE$ recurrence [ 39 , 40 ] , whereas boluses for treating @DISEASE$ can increase the viral load [ 31 ] .	1
5466	Swabs were processed for the extraction of RNA as described in the previous section	1
5467	We performed a RRT - PCR targeting the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ according to Callison et al	1
5468	[ 30 ] and a RRT - PCR targeting the @GENE$ as previously reported [ 26 ] .	1
5469	During the study period , there were 445 @DISEASE$ patients admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital ( Fig	1
5470	1 )	1
5471	All patients were admitted via the emergency department	1
5472	Out of 445 cases , 194 cases were excluded	1
5473	The reasons for exclusion were no respiratory viral PCR test for 170 patients , incomplete data for 20 patients , immediately transferred to the tertiary medical center for two patients , and admission for treatment of underlying diseases for two patients	1
5474	Two patients who were admitted suspicious combined to underlying disease managed to acute @DISEASE$ exacerbation	1
5475	Consequently , 251 patients were enrolled in this study , among whom 67 patients had a positive PCR test for adenovirus ( Adv group ) , while 184 patients had a negative PCR test for adenovirus ( Non - Adv group )	1
5476	Among the Non - Adv group patients , no pathogen was detected in 50 patients in all culture assays ( unknown pathogen group ) , while 134 patients were diagnosed with other viruses , bacteria , and combined pathogens ( Non - Adv group )	1
5477	Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the Adv and Non - Adv groups at admission	1
5478	The median age was 21	1
5479	6 years , and all patients were healthy males prior to the onset of illness	1
5480	The number of current smokers was significantly higher in the Adv group than in the Non - Adv group ( 22	1
5481	2 % vs	1
5482	5	1
5483	4 % , respectively ) , with recent smokers ( < 30 days ) only identified in the Adv group ( n = 4 )	1
5484	A few patients had an underlying disease , such as @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 ) , and @DISEASE$ ( n = 2 )	1
5485	No differences in the duration of symptoms and the time from symptom onset to admission were observed between the two groups ( 3	1

5492	All patients had clinical symptoms and signs of @DISEASE$	1
5493	Adv group patients showed more symptomatic instabilities , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
5494	At admission , initial vital signs and @DISEASE$ severity index ( PSI ) scores were not significantly different between the two groups .	1
5495	Results : Compared to individuals with normal weight , @DISEASE$ individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10 % group of a diary sumscore adding - up 10 different @DISEASE$ symptoms over time	1
5496	@DISEASE$ was associated both with lower @DISEASE$ ( adjusted OR = 2	1
5497	02 , 95 % CI = 1	1
5498	36 - 3	1
5499	00 ) and upper RTIs ( adjusted OR = 1	1
5500	55 , 95 % CI = 1	1

5502	96 )	1
5503	Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs	1
5504	Stratified analyses suggested a stronger association for women and effect modifications by sports activity and dietary habits .	1
5505	They must implement infection control policies in the wards and health and safety measures must be in place .	1
5506	In this example , method 4 of Iterative HFold outperforms the other methods	1
5507	The input structure G has a high energy value and neither method 1 ( HFold ) nor method 2 ( HFold - PKonly ) can expand the pseudoknot - free structure to add the @GENE$	1
5508	Also , by adding too many @GENE$ , method 3 fails to find the @GENE$	1
5509	Thus , method 4 performs better than methods 1 , 2 and 3 .	1
5510	IPknot @GENE$ is a secondary structure prediction method based on Maximum Expected Accuracy ( MEA ) of the @GENE$	1
5511	In addition to the @GENE$ , @GENE$ gets several parameters as input	1
5512	Following , we describe each of these parameters and settings briefly .	1
5513	The study focused on the experience of nurses caring for @DISEASE$ patients at Tshilidzini Hospital in Limpopo Province , South Africa and therefore the findings cannot be generalized	1
5514	However , according to Smith [ 33 ] , generalizability in a qualitative study is not intended	1
5515	The hospital where the study was conducted is situated in the rural area	1
5516	Therefore , if other hospitals had been included , it could have led to different data findings .	1
5517	Policymakers that participated in the study reflected on the importance of addressing @DISEASE$ in the Singaporean context , especially after the outbreaks of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ which took place in 2003 and 2009 , respectively	1
5518	As a physician highlighted : " A lot of incidents drive behavior in Singapore , like for example SARS drove infection control to the front of everything	1
5519	If you speak to some people , ( they ) will say infection control became prominent feature with @DISEASE$ happening	1
5520	" - I11 , Human Health	1
5521	Retrospective chart analysis was approved by the ethical committee of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel ( UZ Brussel ) .	1
5522	In our study , we found that @DISEASE$ is common in persistent preschool wheezers without apparent reasons for impaired mucociliary clearance , and that H	1
5523	influenzae was the predominant aerobic pathogen isolated , followed by S	1
5524	pneumoniae and M	1
5525	catarrhalis	1
5526	We also found frequent bacterial co - infection involving these 3 pathogens	1
5527	Our findings corroborate observations of other authors , who also described the predominance of this @DISEASE$ in children with persistent or recurrent @DISEASE$ [ 9 , 10 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 ] .	1
5528	Some of these aspects can be explored by studying the range of model parameters that give ( initial ) outbreak dynamics consistent with the ( short - term ) epidemic data thus far gathered	1
5529	One approach is to fit model parameters to data by ' ' trajectory matching , ' ' where one looks for the combination of parameters that , in a statistically rigorous sense , give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns [ 34 , 35 ]	1
5530	Alternatively , one may use the well - established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic , the growth rate is approximately exponential [ 17 , 20 ] , with the rate determined by R 0	1
5531	First , we use this approach to examine , in general , how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data	1
5532	To illustrate that our results are not specific to this methodology , we then take incidence data from an @DISEASE$ outbreak and parameterize the epidemic models using trajectory matching .	1
5533	MERS - CoV can alter antigen presentation , host immune response and modulate the apoptotic pathways and @GENE$ pathways [ 7 ] .	1
5534	It seems likely that a subset of the foxes infected during 2009 / 10 were part of a fox - to - fox transmission cycle , with limited skunk - tofox transmission occurring as well	1
5535	This is supported by the fact Although relatively few amino acid changes were associated with the 2003 / 10 host jump , it is possible that one or more of these changes may have been required for efficient transmission of the virus in the local gray fox population	1
5536	Despite an extensive search of the @DISEASE$ virus literature , none of these amino acid changes were described by other studies as being associated with a change in viral phenotype	1
5537	Transmission studies using reverse genetics are required to identify which genetic changes are responsible for increased transmissibility	1
5538	Information from this type of analysis may provide important information on the risk of a similar host jump occurring in other regions , including regions where gray foxes overlap with populations of mesocarnivores that have threatened or endangered status .	1
5539	Although it seems speculative and complex , some researchers have found that reduction of the rate of poliovirus protein synthesis through large - scale utilization of @GENE$ that are not optimal has caused attenuation of viral virulence by lowering specific infectivity [ 34 ]	1
5540	Therefore , the information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution ( especially for DVPVs genotype 1 ) , but also have practical value for the development the poliovirus vaccine	1

5545	The OSR events @GENE$ and @GENE$ arise from the insertion of two closely related @GENE$ from the @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , respectively [ 5 ]	1
5546	The former encodes the @GENE$ that give rise to @DISEASE$ , which is replaced in the latter by the Barst@GENE$  restores fertility : both also have the selectable marker bar which confers tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium	1
5547	Though the left border of the RF3 i@GENE$ ndergone rearrangement in the form of duplication and inversion [ 5 ] , the right borders of both events are relatively intact ( our data [ 6 ] which agree with the two sequences in the database ) .	1
5548	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a crucial @GENE$ regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus	1
5549	In unstimulated cells , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ or @GENE$ ) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
5550	Upon stimulation by activators like @GENE$ ph@GENE$ - α @GENE$ n @GENE$ - 1 @GENE$ 40L , lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) etc	1
5551	, signaling cascades involving activation of vari@GENE$ ses are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of @GENE$ se@GENE$ KKs ) which phosphoryl@GENE$ κBα , leading to its degradation by @GENE$ lex	1

5553	Human Enterovirus 68 Interferes with the Host Cell Cycle to Facilitate Viral Production	1
5554	@GENE$ is chemotactic for numerous cell types	1
5555	It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis , angiogenesis and T - cell function , which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe @DISEASE$ ( 18 )	1
5556	Changes in platelet morphology , with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction , may occur in @DISEASE$ , and thrombocytes are activated in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
5557	Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with @DISEASE$ has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls ( 19 ) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in @DIS@GENE$ $	1
5558	In the present study , levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of @DISEASE$@GENE$ suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of @DISEASE$ @GENE$ 	1
5559	An FPV strain identical to that used in a commercially available MLV FPV vaccine was detected in faecal samples from New Zealand cases	1
5560	Subsequently , qPCR was performed to determine FPV viral loads in DNA extracts of mesenteric lymph nodes and tissues from these cases using a TaqMan qPCR assay as described previously [ 14 ]	1
5561	Faecal samples containing vaccine virus were also submitted to a commercial laboratory for batch testing on a multiplex qPCR panel to detect potential faecal co - pathogens including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , Clostridium perfringens , Giardia spp , Salmonella spp , Campylobacter jejuni , Campylobacter coli and Toxoplasma gondii ( Idexx Pty Ltd	1

5563	For flow cytometry experiments , mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine / acepromazine , then blood was collected in 5 μM EDTA in dPBS ( Gibco )	1
5564	Mice were transcardially perfused with dPBS , and then , the spleen , brain , popliteal LNs , and femur were removed	1

5572	Brain , spleen , and LN tissues were pushed through a 70 - μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 10 min	1
5573	Brain cell pellets were resuspended in 37 % isotonic Percoll ( GE healthcare ) and centrifuged at 1200g for 30 min to remove myelin debris , and pellet was resuspended in dPBS	1
5574	Red blood cells were lysed in blood , spleen , and bone marrow samples with ACK lysing buffer ( Gibco ) for 5 min , then centrifuged at 500g for 10 min and resuspended in dPBS	1
5575	Prior to immunostaining , all cells were blocked with 1 : 50	1
5576	In addition to protein , the ICIs observed in the limited bronchial epithelial samples were also partially composed of @GENE$	1
5577	While the RNA could be of viral origin it is important to note that many of the host - derived intracellular protein aggregates previously noted also contain @GENE$ [ 113 , 114 , 116 , 117 ]	1
5578	It is reasonable to conclude that if the ICIs observed in @DISEASE$ patients were related to one of these structures , they would positively stain for RNA .	1
5579	In addition to @DISEASE$ , laboratory - confirmed co - infections were reported for 16 children ( 34	1
5580	0 % out of 47 ( 1 ) ) .	1
5581	This project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention of China , the Ethical Review Committee of Beijing Hospital , and the Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical College	1
5582	Individual written informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all of the participants .	1
5583	@DISEASE$ requiring intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality	1
5584	Delays in the provision of adequate antimicrobial therapy have been reported to be associated with excess mortality [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ; therefore , rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of severe @DISEASE$ is essential for successful treatment	1
5585	In recent years , bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) has been established as a useful technique for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens from the alveolar level , and can thus be used to accurately define the causative organisms of @DISEASE$ [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]	1
5586	However , a conventional culture usually takes at least a few days , and microbiological yield is often compromised by prior empirical usage of antimicrobial agents	1
5587	In addition , identification of viruses and atypical organisms requires a separate etiologic work - up	1
5588	Cellular analysis of BAL fluid , including total and differential cell counts and the CD4 + :@GENE$  + T - lymphocyte ratio , is useful for the diagnosis of various @DISEASE$ [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
5589	Under an appropriate clinical setting , BAL fluid analysis can provide highly suggestive or even diagnostic information for specific @DISEASE$ in the absence of a lung biopsy [ 10 ]	1
5590	However , only a few previous studies with limited patient populations [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] have evaluated the role of cellular analysis of BAL fluid in patients with suspected @DISEASE$	1
5591	Most of these studies focused on the differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ from @DISEASE$ infectious pulmonary diseases , not on the prediction of @DISEASE$ etiology	1
5592	BAL fluid analysis can be performed within several hours	1
5593	Therefore , such analysis would be useful for guiding early treatment if it could predict the etiology of @DISEASE$ , similar to the role of cerebrospinal fluid cellular analysis , which can reliably differentiate among @DISEASE$ etiologies	1
5594	Therefore , this study investigated whether analysis of the cellular profile of BAL fluid can predict the etiology of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ patients admitted to the medical ICU .	1

5597	Fourth , many participants reported that " cultural aspects " and perception regarding medication influenced patients ' requests for antibiotics , with patients requesting them , and GPs recognizing feeling the pressure to prescribe them	1
5598	Other research has found similar findings , with Lam et al	1
5599	observing that primary healthcare physicians over - prescribed antibiotics in order to satisfy their patients [ 31 ]	1
5600	There were also reports suggesting a lack of awareness of @DISEASE$ from the public and as a result , patients continued demanding antibiotics even when they were not clinically indicated	1
5601	This was also reported in a Singaporean study that surveyed patients and found that most patients seeking primary health care in Singapore were misinformed about the role of antibiotics , with poor knowledge being associated with wanting antibiotics [ 32 ] .	1
5602	Four sub - scales were computed by summing scores for the items within each of the factors identified in the factor analysis	1
5603	In addition , a total @GENE$ was computed by summing scores across the four sub - scales	1
5604	Scores on the four sub - scales and @GENE$ were submitted to age , gender , and regional analysis .	1
5605	HeLa , SCH07072 , and muSCH cells showed similar doubling patterns when 72 hr growth curves were plotted ( Figure S1A )	1
5606	Northern blot analysis showed that the RNA stability and RNA expression patterns of three @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) in the three cell lines were not affected by expression of the @GENE$ ( Figure @GENE$ )	1
5607	Taken together , expression of the @GENE$ in SCH07072 cells did not affect cell growth or viability .	1
5608	Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were performed as described previously [ 40 ]	1
5609	Cells on coverslips were washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed for 10 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature	1
5610	Cells were permeabilized with Perm - buffer ( 1 % BSA , 0	1
5611	1 % saponin , 0	1
5612	1 % sodium azide in PBS ) for 10 min at room temperature ( RT )	1
5613	After blocking with 3 % BSA in PBS for 1 hr , 3D8 scFv - treated cells were incubated with @GENE$ , followed by @GENE$	1
5614	Nuclei were stained with DAPI during the last 10 min of incubation at RT	1
5615	Cells on coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti - fade mounting medium ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA , USA ) , and observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope and analyzed with Carl Zeiss LSM Image software ( Jena , Germany )	1
5616	3D8 scFv - transfected cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry	1
5617	HeLa cells grown in sixwell plates ( 1610 5 cells / well ) were pre - incubated in serum - free DMEM for 30 min at 37uC and were either untreated or treated with each inhibitor for 30 min at 37uC before @GENE$ scFv ( 10 mM ) treatment	1
5618	Cells suspended with @GENE$ were treated once more with 0	1
5619	1 % @GENE$ for 3 min at 37uC to wash off @GENE$	1
5620	After washing with ice - cold PBS once , cells were fixed and permeabilized as per the procedures described above	1
5621	Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS twice , labeled with @GENE$ , followed by @GENE$ , and then analyzed using a FACS Calibur TM ( BD Biosciences , San Diego , CA , USA )	1
5622	A total of 1610 4 cells were analyzed for each test .	1
5623	@DISEASE$ infections have long been associated with the induction and reoccurrence of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ ( 1 )	1
5624	Nevertheless , a firm association between virus and @DISEASE$ remains elusive , as active viral replication has thus far never been detected within CNS tissue of @DISEASE$ patients	1
5625	On the other side , a protective role of viral infections against @DISEASE$ has also been proposed ( 8 ) , but the mechanisms preventing @DISEASE$ after @DISEASE$ remain largely unknown	1
5626	Among @DISEASE$ murine models , @DISEASE$ infection reproduces several aspects of @DISEASE$ pathogenesis ( 12 )	1
5627	Importantly , tissue damage occurs temporally remote from @DISEASE$ infection as indicated by peak @DISEASE$ after elimination of infectious virus ( 12 )	1
5628	Moreover , lesion size is @GENE$ ned by IL - 10 during persistence independent of viral load ( 42 )	1
5629	Lastly , myelin loss correlates with the peripheral activation of myelin - specific CD4 + T cells , which access the CNS but decline with time despite ongoing @DISEASE$ ( 13 )	1
5630	The apparent control of the endogenous SR T cells suggested suppressive mechanisms prevent ascending clinical @DISEASE$ during persistent infection	1
5631	@DISEASE$ infection thus represents a unique model to assess how viral infection may prevent @DISEASE$ .@GENE$ egs are among the regulatory mechanisms dampening @DISEASE$ pathogenesis , their implication in controlling SR CD4 + T cells was of particular interest	1
5632	The data herein are novel in demonstrat@GENE$ at@GENE$ 3 + Treg abrogation during persistence preferentially enhanced endogenously primed , peripheral SR CD4 + T cells but had no effect on CNS localized SR T cells or tissue damage during chronic @DISEASE$	1
5633	These observations are consistent with a previous report by Trandem et al	1
5634	( 20 ) showing t@GENE$ egs adoptively transferred into acutely @DISEASE$ - infected mice were not detected within the CNS but rather exerted prominent function within CLN by dampening dendritic cell activation , T cell proliferati@GENE$ cytokine expr@GENE$  .@GENE$ 3 + Treg dependent downregulation of CLN inflammatory response thus correlated with limited @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ without affecting viral persistence ( 20 )	1
5635	Our results on regulation of SR T cells during persistence also corroborated control of transferred SR CD4 + T cell proliferation by Foxp3 + Tregs during a heterologous MHV infection ( 21 )	1
5636	A primary role of Foxp3 + Tregs within draining lymph nodes was also observed in other infectious models , as well as during cancer and autoimmunity ( 36 , ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 )	1
5637	Nevertheless , our data differ from results by Trandem et al	1
5638	with respect to the direct correlation between decreased peripheral inflammation by Foxp3 + Tregs with decreased CNS cellular infiltration and demyelination	1
5639	Despite extensive expansion of the inflammatory response within the CLN of mice depleted of Foxp3 + Tregs during persistence , no alteration of CNS inflammation or tissue damage was evident	1
5640	These differences may reside in the differential properties of the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) between acute and chronic JHMV infection , as BBB permeability is restored to naive levels after day 14 p	1
5641	i	1
5642	( 46 ) , thus potentially limiting effector T cell access into the CNS after Foxp3 + Treg depletion	1
5643	Further , enlarged CLN associated with increased chemokine expression indicated restricted T cell egress is responsible for the lack of altered CNS inflammation	1
5644	Retention of effector T cells within the draining lymph nodes following Foxp3 + Treg depletion was also observed during herpes simplex viral ( HSV ) infection	1
5645	In this model , Treg - mediated suppression of chemokine production within lymph nodes facilitated effector T cell egress and trafficking to the infection site ( 36 )	1
5646	While a similar mode of Treg action is supported by our studies , Treg supplementation , rather than depletion , enhanced chemokine production and T effector cell retention in lymph nodes during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , thereby diminishing CNS T cell migration ( 47 )	1
5647	All together , these diverse CNS inflammation models suggest that Foxp3 + Treg can modulate effector T cells in draining lymph nodes both at the expansion phase as well as egress phase	1
5648	The relative balance between expansion and local cytokine / chemokine expression then ultimately determines egress into circulation and access to the CNS .	1
5649	Over the past decade , next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) has become a useful tool to identify novel or emerging infectious agents	1
5650	1 Although NGS is not yet used as a routine diagnostic tool , it is increasingly used as a second line of investigation for select clinical cases , particularly when routine molecular and serological assays fail to identify a causative pathogen	1
5651	We developed a NGS - based pipeline ( ezVIR ) to process NGS data for the identification of viruses in humans 2 with the aim of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses in biological specimens of subjects with unexplained clinical syndromes	1
5652	2 , 3 We used ezVIR to analyze 30 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in a previous study that examined the causes of @DISEASE$ in Tanzanian children 4 who were suffering from @DISEASE$ of any type but for whom an infectious agent was not detected ( except colonizing bacteria in the nasopharynx ) despite extensive investigations , including viral , bacterial and parasitic molecular and serological assays	1
5653	4 The specimens were pooled in groups of five and assessed according to the specific RNA and DNA library preparation protocols as previously described 2 for NGS analysis ( paired - end sequencing using the 100 - bp protocol with indexing on a HiSeq 2500 ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA )	1
5654	Unexpectedly , an astrovirus VA1 was identified in pool 1 ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table S1 ) .	1
5655	To determine the effects of @GENE$ on CSFV replication , recombinant lentiviruses expressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) against @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or non - targeting @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
5656	@DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ where the exact cause has not yet been identified [ 26 ] ( Fig	1
5657	1 )	1
5658	The occurrence of @DISEASE$ in pigs involves interactions between the sow , piglet , environment , ETEC bacteria and livestock management [ 27 ] .	1
5659	All of the samples were collected from inpatient children with @DISEASE$ at hospitals in Beijing ( n = 259 ) and Zhejiang Province ( n = 293 ) from 2007 to 2010	1
5660	The age and gender distributions are shown in Table 1	1
5661	The median age of this population is 7 and 7	1
5662	5 months , respectively	1
5663	The demographic characteristics of the Northern and Eastern Chinese population were matched well , and no significant differences were observed regarding gender and age distribution ( P > 0	1
5664	05 ) .	1
5665	Intravenous immunoglobulin fails to improve @DISEASE$ in patients undergoing ECMO therapy	1
5666	The stock solution was then diluted with methanol in twofold ( 50 g / mL ) dilutions to obtain a series of working standard solutions	1
5667	All working standard solutions were stored in freezer at − 20 ∘ C prior to analysis .	1
5668	With resistance mutations emerging in CVB3 @GENE$ , we next hypothesized that these mutations may enhance viral replication in polyamine - depleted cells by maintaining proteolytic activity	1
5669	To test this , we generated @GENE$ through site - directed mutagenesis of our @GENE$	1
5670	We then cotransfected these @GENE$ and the wildtype controls with our @GENE$ reporter system into untreated and 500 µM DFMO - treated Veros	1
5671	At 24 h , we measured @GENE$ activity and normalized to renilla @GENE$ activity and to control cells transfected with @GENE$ alone ( no @GENE$ )	1
5672	We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited @GENE$ activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B )	1
5673	Interestingly , we also observed that both @GENE$ and @GENE$ exhibited robust @GENE$ activity , even in DFMO - treated cells	1
5674	We also observed that @GENE$ exhibited higher @GENE$ activity than @GENE$ , though this was not observed for 2A .	1
5675	To further support the finding that @GENE$ are bona fide @GENE$ , supernatants obtained and purified after transfection of HEK293T cells with HIV - 1 and @GENE$ were layered onto a linear OptiprepTM gradient ( 5 to 20 % w / v ) and then ultracentrifuged for 45 minutes at 28 , 000 rpm for velocity gradient analyses	1
5676	Aliquots were harvested from the top of the gradient , precipitated with TCA and analyzed by WB ( Figure 2D )	1
5677	The signals obtained after WB were quantified by densitometry and were plotted here to indicate the percentage of each protein present in each fraction with respect to the overall protein present ( Figure 2D , for space constraint the graph is presented only for @GENE$ )	1
5678	Under these conditions , more than 95 % of the total @GENE$ co - migrated with @GENE$ in velocity gradients	1
5679	These results along with similar co - migration observed between these proteins upon linear sucrose equilibrium density gradients ( data not shown ) indicate that @GENE$ are @GENE$ .	1
5680	Passaging CVB3 in Vero cells can result in the emergence of a virus with fitness changes that provide a replicative advantage , as we had observed with our @DISEASE$ mutant viruses [ 31 ]	1
5681	To determine whether our CVB3 mutants had fitness enhancement manifesting as a more rapidly replicating virus , we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus	1
5682	We observed no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size ( Figure 3D )	1
5683	To better measure viral fitness via competition assay , we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A 29K or 3C 52R , and after five passages , we extracted RNA , reverse transcribed , amplif@GENE$ mes by PCR , and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to e@GENE$ ase ( Table 1 )	1
5684	After the fifth passage , we observed that the wildtype and either protease mutant virus existed as a mixed population , with peaks corresponding to the wildtype and mutant nucleotide present in the samples ( Figure 3E , representative of three independent passages )	1
5685	Additionally , we passaged mutant virus without competition to determine the stability of the mutant	1
5686	We observed that the mutation was maintained after five passages , suggesting that there is no fitness cost to this mutation in our cell culture conditions	1
5687	Altogether , our data suggest that protease - mutant CVB3 exhibits no significant replicative advantage compared to wildtype CVB3 .	1
5688	A promising addition to vaccination is the manipulation of innate immunity	1
5689	Innate pathogen recognition relies on a set of @GENE$ , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which enable the immediate reaction of specific immune cells to pathogen " danger signals " , the so - called @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 4 ]	1
5690	Due to their abundance in all bacterial as well as some @GENE$ genomes , oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) containing @GENE$ are effectively recognized as @GENE$ by the vertebrate innate immune system [ 5 ]	1
5691	Response to CpG ODN stimulation is conferred through @GENE$ , expressed mainly in the intracellular compartments of human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) [ 6 , 7 ]	1
5692	Alarmed @GENE$ is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms : upregulation of costimulatory molecules @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [ 8 , 9 ] and production of @GENE$ such as @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) α , contribute to providing an optimal immune environment for the development of innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens [ 10 , 11 ]	1
5693	Probably the most important antiviral property of CpG ODN resides in their potential to stimulate the production of high amounts@GENE$ IFN by pDCs [ 12 ]	1
5694	This family@GENE$ nes , which inclu@GENE$ FN@GENE$ FNω @GENE$ FNβ , has been shown to considerably enhance natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity [ 13 ] , promote differentiation , maturation and immunostimulatory functions of monocytes and DCs [ 14 ] , induce B cell production@GENE$ lin [ 15 ] and T - helper ( Th ) 1 differentiation of T cells [ 16 , 17 ]	1
5695	Moreover , upon binding to th@GENE$ tor , type I IFNs effectively induce the synthesis of various intracellular proteins which interfere with the replication of a broad range of viruses [ 18 ]	1
5696	The myxovirusresistance protein ( Mx ) GTPase is a well - studied example of these intracellular antiviral effectors	1
5697	This enzyme is known to be directly regulated by the type I IFN , and its detection is readily used as marker for upregulation and biological activity of this cytokine family [ 19 ] .	1
5698	In previous work , Tildesley et al	1
5699	[ 32 ] demonstrated that even in the absence of precise locations of farms , accurate predictions of the impact of interventions are possible	1
5700	We aim to develop an understanding of the predictive power of mathematical models when only a subset of the network information is available	1
5701	We develop a model to simulate the spread of a rapidly spreading disease such as @DISEASE$ through the UK cattle movement network	1
5702	Mathematical models have previously played a key role in determining the risk of disease spread through networks of livestock movements for diseases such as @DISEASE$ [ 17 , 18 , 21 , 33 ] , bTB [ 12 , 13 , 19 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 34 , 35 ]	1
5703	Our aim in this paper is to investigate the ability of such models to provide policy advice in countries where only partial information regarding livestock movements is available .	1
5704	@GENE$ was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes ( Figure 2A )	1
5705	Notably , the levels of @GENE$ at the end of the labeling period ( 0 minute chase ) in @GENE$ alone expressing cells were less than that in IKKβ and ORF2 coexpressing cells , indicating that @GENE$ is a very labile protein in IKKβ expressing cells	1
5706	The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of @GENE$ at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100 %	1
5707	To further confirm whether @GENE$ stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of @GENE$ in ORF2 expressing cells , nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with @GENE$	1
5708	As seen in Figure 2B , ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more @GENE$ in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 2 and 4 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below )	1
5709	As expected , mock transfected cells were found to contain more @GENE$ in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 1 and 3 )	1
5710	This is attributed to the fact that basal @GENE$ activity is higher in Huh7 cells [ 13 ]	1
5711	In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls , equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with @GENE$ and @GENE$ .	1
5712	For infection of HLA cultures , 2 × 10 6 cells were incubated overnight with virus preparations equivalent to 1 ng of @GENE$ , and cell culture supernatant was collected every second or third day post infection	1
5713	Where indicated , the cells were treated with different concentrations of the DIs P22077 or @GENE$ as part of the medium change on the delineated days post infection ( dpi ) .	1
5714	Seven weeks after the challenge , given the chronic reduction in the number of laid eggs , we divided nine of the ten birds of the H9 - group into nine additional isolators , to monitor the laying performances on an individual basis and relate it to the pathological and histopathological data	1
5715	The separation of the layers allowed the identification of 3 / 10 non - laying birds , over a longer period of 4 weeks	1
5716	On week 11 pi we euthanized and necropsied all of the birds and we observed @DISEASE$ in the three birds in which laying had stopped	1
5717	Abundant yolk material filled the abdomen and the serosa appeared thickened and characterized by a strong yellow pigmentation	1
5718	In these birds , the ovary had multiple follicles at different stages of maturation , indicating a normal function of the organ , and the oviduct appeared to be macroscopically normal	1
5719	The histological examination of the oviducts highlighted that in the three birds with @DISEASE$ , the infundibulum architecture was altered by the extensive presence of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ; @DISEASE$ lymphocytic follicles and a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were also evident	1
5720	The rest of the oviduct had no lesion ( Figure 5 ; Table 3 )	1
5721	We did not record any pathological aspect in the remaining animals , in which egg production had returned to normality .	1
5722	- 16 - enabling lower ventilation rate ) allow also for lower infiltration of outdoor particles and therefore the feasibility of the approach is better in the current building stock .	1
5723	The health - based optimum ventilation was defined in this scenario also , and used when calculating the burden of disease results and the reduction potential compared to the baseline scenario .	1
5724	@DISEASE$ problems continuously raise a lot of attention in Finland , too .	1
5725	There are two ways of defining format of the UID conversion : using either precompiled or user - defined name templates	1
5726	The user is currently provided with several precompiled templates for name generation , which can be used " as is " or after refinement ( see below )	1
5727	Each template is accompanied with examples of input to illustrate its usage	1
5728	" Entry name " template can be useful for identifying misspelled identifiers , as well as for comparative inspection of basic information about the entries in UniProt	1
5729	Two other templates ( " Gene " and " Species " ) can be used for converting UIDs into gene and species names , respectively , as they are specified in GenBank	1
5730	The " @GENE$ " template combines full @GENE$ with @GENE$ ( gi ) that are neatly separated	1
5731	The " @GENE$ " includes @GENE$ , @GENE$ , protein description and @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , in a size restricted manner to facilitate reading a @GENE$	1
5732	These templates are suited for producing names of sequences originated from a wide range of organisms	1
5733	" @GENE$ " template converts @GENE$ organism name annotation into acronym	1
5734	Three templates were designed specifically for viruses to address specifics of this group for which the naming remains a matter of debate [ 15 , 17 ]	1
5735	For several medically important viruses with large sampling from the natural diversity , e	1
5736	g	1
5737	influenza and noroviruses [ 18 , 22 ] , names conventions were accepted by the field to include reference to serotype , host species , country of isolation , strain or isolate name , collection date and , for influenza viruses , subtype	1
5738	These names are part of the GenBank entries where from they can be readily extracted	1
5739	To demonstrate that similar names can be also generated on - the - fly from two components , using the isolate / strain and serotype fields in respective entries , a separate " @GENE$ is provided	1
5740	We extended this approach by designing two other virus templates , " @GENE$ " and " @GENE$ " , that could generate names with complex structure for majority of other viruses for which no consensus on the naming has been reached	1
5741	These templates combine information from up to six separate entry fields , each keeping an elementary record e	1
5742	g	1
5743	about date or place of virus isolation	1
5744	" @GENE$ " additionally includes reference to protein function	1
5745	These templates could help researchers studying many viruses , e	1
5746	g	1
5747	coronaviruses and picornaviruses [ 15 ] communicate their sequence - based data in a name format similar to that accepted for influenza virus	1
5748	SNAD - mediated solution to the generation of complex virus names reinforces the role of diverse fields in sequence entries as the primary source of information	1
5749	If these fields are completed with records as expected , virus names can be readily generated under different and evolving conventions	1
5750	Thus , SNAD provides a tool for explora - SNAD dataflow Figure 1 SNAD dataflow	1
5751	User submits sequence UIDs and defines a format of conversion by choosing a template	1
5752	SNAD analyzes the input , extracts UIDs from it and queries a user - defined database to locate cognate entries	1
5753	The next step is extracting annotation from the entries and parsing the user - selected template to generate separate parts	1
5754	They are mapped onto annotation to produce name parts , which are combined into names according to the template	1
5755	Finally , SNAD substitutes the submitted UIDs in list , alignment , or tree with the designed names and returns results to the user	1
5756	Unique IDs conversion with SNAD	1
5757	Nine IDs from GenBank ( section " Before UID conversion " ) are converted using a pre - compiled four - characteristic template " Complex protein name " that includes the following GenBank characteristics : " Primary ID " ( gi number ) ; organism name formatted as " G [ enus ]	1
5758	species " ; protein product and gene locus tag	1
5759	Three delimiters are used : space , " [ " and " ] " , and none of characteristics is abbreviated	1
5760	First three characteristics have their size limited to : 9 , 6 , and 17 symbols , respectively	1
5761	Results of the conversion are shown in " After UID conversion " section	1
5762	Each arrow links a delimiter to a part of converted names	1
5763	{	1
5764	.	1
5765	} indicates that more than one organism name characteristic is found for a submitted ID ( see [ GenBank / Protein : 126224 ] , features source / organism )	1
5766	SNAD users can initiate refining of any of the provided templates ( by using " Refine name template " option ) or generate de novo templates by choosing " User defined " template that automatically activates the refining mode	1
5767	In both instances , the advanced template - building facility becomes available for the user	1
5768	It empowers the user with fine control over the output name format , including the number of independently designed parts of the name , characteristic of each part , parts order , size of each part , and type of delimiter preceding each part ( Figure 2 )	1
5769	Design of each part in the name is controlled by a separate row	1
5770	The name parts - from left to right - are defined by respective rows in the template - building facility from top to bottom	1
5771	Rows can be moved up and down or deleted and inserted with a respective effect on the name structure and content	1
5772	For retrieving sequence characteristics from database entries SNAD uses BioPerl scheme with internally controlled vocabulary of annotation [ 26 ]	1
5773	Information from two or more annotation fields can also be combined in a single characteristic in a template	1
5774	For instance , for virus name templates , a combination " strain OR isolate " may be used to form a characteristic	1
5775	For name designing , the user can choose from a dropdown menu of sequence characteristics and features that were derived from available databases	1
5776	These characteristics can be used separately or in combination to design a name format that can combine , for instance , unique reference to the original database with a concise biological description of the entry ( see Figure 2 for an example )	1
5777	For characteristics which values are described with several words , first letters of these words can be combined using characteristic ' s " abbreviate " option to produce acronyms	1
5778	If a selected characteristic is not available in annotation for a sequence , it is replaced in the sequence name with a symbol that the user selected from a separate drop - down menu	1
5779	Due to gaps in annotation , names designed with the templates may not be complete for every entry .	1
5780	Because @GENE$ forms the same interactions with a free alanine and the N - terminal alanine residue of a poly - alanine peptide substrate , we believe that the crystal structures of @GENE$ complexed with free amino acids reflect the interactions between @GENE$ and the N - terminal amino acid residues of at least simple peptide substrates 4	1
5781	All of the free amino acids in the crystal structures bound to @GENE$ in a similar manner as alanine , with the exception of key differences in their side chain interactions	1
5782	The @GENE$ were oriented in a pocket in the @GENE$ with hydrophobic walls and an @GENE$ ( Fig	1
5783	3A )	1
5784	The side chains with different lengths were able to fit into the pocket because of the open end and were found to primarily form hydrophobic interactions with the walls of the pocket ( Fig	1
5785	3B )	1
5786	For example , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ of the methionine side chain formed hydrophobic interactions with Met349 / Gln208 , Ala346 , and Phe467 on the pocket walls ( Fig	1
5787	3B )	1
5788	Polar side chains were also able to form additional interactions with @GENE$ as in the case of arginine where the guanidine group formed a cationic - Pi interaction with Phe467 ( Fig	1
5789	3B )	1
5790	In general , the @GENE$ - binding affinity of amino acids is positively associated with the extent of hydrophobic or other affinity - increasing interactions between their @GENE$ and the pocket walls	1
5791	Consequently , amino acids with long , nonpolar side chains like leucine generally have high @GENE$ - binding affinity	1
5792	Analysis of the crystal structures of @GENE$ complexed with non - favored amino acids found that those residues all shared one unique feature - their @GENE$ had unfavorable interactions with the catalytically critical carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from @GENE$ ( Fig	1
5793	3B )	1

5805	Hospital - based studies in children < 5 years of age from developing countries published over the last 20 years have identified viruses ( excluding @DISEASE$ ) in 8	1
5806	4 % [ 25 ] to 45 % [ 26 ] of @DISEASE$ episodes	1
5807	One of the larger studies , which included nearly 1 , 500 Pakistani children < 5 years of age , detected a virus ( including adenovirus ) in 37 % of cases using viral culture and immunofluorescence ( IF ) [ 27 ]	1
5808	Previous community - based studies with longitudi - nal follow - up of children have identified viruses in 11 % to 45 % of @DISEASE$ cases [ 1 , 28 , 29 ] .	1
5809	We isolated PIV3 in 27 months of our 36 month - study , but an increasing number of infections were seen between April to May and September each year , while the largest epidemic occurred in June 2006	1
5810	The virus has been known to exhibit an endemic pattern and to cause yearly epidemics in spring and summer in temperate climates [ 50 ]	1
5811	PIV1 was isolated in smaller numbers throughout the study period ( in 28 of 36 months ) , and we could not observe the biennial pattern of fall epidemics seen elsewhere [ 51 ] .	1
5812	Well - known , as well as previously uncharacterized infections continue to ( re ) emerge around the globe	1
5813	To avoid casualties from outbreaks of these infections and from the potential criminal uses of bioagents , surveillance systems are needed that have the capacity to identify such outbreaks accurately and rapidly	1
5814	The accuracy and timeliness of biosurveillance systems rests on the ability to model the uncertainty , severity , and aberrancy of clinical symptoms that are likely to portend disease outbreaks as expressed through the data monitoring system	1
5815	Shmueli [ 1 ] summarizes the problems that biosurveillance systems , in general , pose to traditional statistical monitoring : ( a ) biosurveillance data may not be independent or stationary ; ( b ) non - traditional data are assumed to contain earlier signature of an outbreak but this signal is weaker compared to actual diagnosis data ; ( c ) since there are no data that contain bioterrorist outbreaks , outbreak patterns particularly as they would manifest in non - traditional data streams are unknown ; ( d ) biosurveillance data are assumed to have no bioterrorist outbreaks , but the natural outbreaks add up to the background noise .	1
5816	The ability of the immune sera from vaccinated RM to block @DISEASE$ infection of Vero cells , @DISEASE$ ( SK - N - SH ) or neural progenitor ( U - 87MG ) cells in vitro was examined by IFA	1
5817	ZIKV strains ( MR766 or PR209 ) were pre - incubated in sera or diluted RM - immune sera and added to monolayers of each cell type	1
5818	Protection against @DISEASE$ and disease in IFNAR − / − mice following ZIKV - prME@GENE$ nisation In exploratory studies , 5 - 6 - week - old IFNAR ( − / − ) mice ( n = 10 ) were challenged with 1 × 10 6 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of the ZIKV - PR209 isolate , administered by either subcutaneous ( s	1

5822	) ; intracranial ( i	1
5823	c ) ; or intravenous ( i	1
5824	v	1
5825	) routes	1
5826	After the challenge , all the animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection , which included routine measurement of body weight as well as inspection for other signs of a @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
5827	No change in the general appearance of the mice was observed during the first 4 days after inoculation	1
5828	However , after the fourth day , the mice in each of the groups demonstrated reduced overall activity , decreased mobility and a @DISEASE$ often accompanied by @DISEASE$ , decreased water intake and obvious @DISEASE$	1
5829	The animals succumbed to the infection between day 6 and day 8 regardless of the route of viral challenge ( Supplementary Figure S5A - E )	1
5830	On the basis of these data , the subsequent studies to evaluate ZIKV - prME - mediated protection in this model @GENE$ the s	1

5832	route for challenge .	1
5833	PMOs were also reported to increase the survival of @DISEASE$ - infected cats [ 89 ]	1
5834	Studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo	1
5835	One study found that both PPMO - and PMO - treated mice survived @DISEASE$ lethal challenge ( 100 % and 85 % respectively , the difference being not statistically significant ) [ 78 ]	1
5836	However , other comparative reports clearly document that PPMO are far more effective than PMOs in mice	1
5837	PPMOs offered 100 % protection against @DISEASE$ at 5 - μg and 50 - μg doses while PMOs gave only 15 % protection at 50 - μg doses [ 64 ]	1
5838	PPMOs increased survival of @DISEASE$ - infected mice up to eight days whereas PMOs did not provide any survival benefit [ 70 ]	1
5839	PMOs could not protect mice against @DISEASE$ while PPMOs , even at doses 10 - fold lower , delayed clinical signs and increased @DISEASE$ - infected mice survival by 60 % [ 67 ]	1
5840	The differential activities observed in @DISEASE$ studies may be explained by the fact that Swenson et a l	1
5841	used the ( RXR ) 4 XB peptide while Enterlein et al	1
5842	linked their PMO to the R 9 F 2 C peptide .	1
5843	The tat peptide was also conjugated to peptide ligands impairing interactions between the HIV - 1 regulatory protein @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 105 ]	1
5844	Following their @GENE$ - mediated cellular uptake into primary lymphocytes and macrophages , these inhibitory heptapeptides , expressed in fusion with @GENE$ , successfully suppressed HIV - 1 replication , although at a concentration higher than those of currently used antiviral drugs	1
5845	Along with a better design of the peptide ligand , conjugation to other @GENE$ may improve cellular uptake and therefore antiviral activity .	1
5846	Antioxidants may act as physical barriers to prevent ROS generation or ROS access to important biological sites ( UV filters , cell membranes ) ; chemical traps / sinks that " absorb " energy and electrons , quenching ROS ( carotenoids , anthocyanidins ) ; catalytic systems that neutralize or divert ROS [ antioxidant enzymes @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ] ; binding / inactivation of metal ions to prevent generation of ROS ( ferritin , ceruloplasmin , catechins ) ; and chain - breaking antioxidants which scavenge and destroy ROS ( ascorbic acid , tocopherols , uric acid , glutathione , flavonoids ) [ 27 ]	1
5847	Therefore , and based on their mode of action , the antioxidants can be classified as primary , secondary or co - antioxidants	1
5848	Primary antioxidants are able to donate a hydrogen atom rapidly to a lipid radical , forming a new radical , which is more stable	1
5849	Secondary antioxidants react with the initiating radicals ( or inhibit the @GENE$ ) , or reduce the oxygen level ( without generating reactive radical species )	1
5850	Therefore , these secondary antioxidants can retard the rate of radical initiation reaction by elimination of initiators	1
5851	This can be performed by deactivating high energy species ( singlet oxygen ) ; absorbing UV light ; scavenging of oxygen ; chelating metal that catalyses free radical reaction , or inhibiting @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , among other @GENE$ [ 28 ] .	1
5852	In comparison to ODN of other groups , @GENE$ have been used in much fewer studies concerning innate antiviral responses	1
5853	This is most likely the result of the more time consuming and costly manufacturing process of these molecules linked to the synthesis of the @GENE$ necessary for optimal immune effects [ 31 ]	1
5854	Also , @GENE$ exhibit only weak stimulation of B cells , which produce @GENE$ that are valuable in later antiviral responses	1
5855	Stability of @GENE$ in vivo has also been questioned due to the only partial phosphorothioate backbone of these molecules	1
5856	This can be partially compensated however , by the formation , through association of their @GENE$ , of highly ordered Gtetrad structures with enhanced stability [ 12 ]	1
5857	Their smaller content in synthetic backbones could moreover help reduce possible long - term side effects [ 79 , 80 ]	1
5858	Most importantly , @GENE$ A remain the most potent inducers of @GENE$ , themselves the most biologically active antiviral molecules known to date [ 19 ]	1
5859	With regard to this , a @GENE$ arketed in both Japan ( Intercat ® ) and Europe ( Virbagen Omega ® ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for @DISEASE$ and canine @DISEASE$ [ 67 , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of @DISEASE$ [ 87 ]	1
5860	However , when compared to direct initiation of antiviral mechanisms by a recombinant IF@GENE$ on of CpG ODN holds @GENE$ ntage of inducing the production of all type I IFN and thei@GENE$ ypes , which have been shown to possess differential antiviral properties and kinetics [ 88 ]	1
5861	Our data demonstrate that five viral species belonging to the @DISEASE$ and Retrovirus families were highly sensitive to the immunologic effects of ODN 2216 in feline cells	1
5862	Strength and breadth of antiviral defense mechanisms induced in vivo by this molecule have the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN .@GENE$ 	1
5863	Prototype @GENE$ , ODN 2216 , induce proliferation of primary feline immune cells and enhance their expression of @GENE$ Proliferation of PBMCs in response to treatment with CpG ODN gives strong indications about the biological activity of the @GENE$ and has been used to screen ODN in many species [ 25 ]	1
5864	In relation to this , the potential of @GENE$ to induce proliferation of feline PBMCs were assessed by measurement of 3 H - thymidine incorporation after stimulation	1
5865	Although considerable variability was observed between individuals , a 2 - fold increase in proliferation was observed after stimulation with ODN 2216 when compared to stimulation with inactive control ODN 2243 ( p = 0	1
5866	0281 , Figure 1A )	1
5867	The cells of three cats ( c08 , c09 , c12 ) could be stimulated to particularly high proliferative rates by ODN 2216 ( values above the mean of eight cats illustrated in Figure 1A ) in the following order : @GENE$ > @GENE$ > @GENE$ .	1

5871	Several key themes emerge when examining scholarly narratives about the politics of epidemics namely the socioeconomic distribution of disease , decision - making in research and development , the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways , and attribution of responsibility for causing the outbreak and determining who is responsible for responding	1
5872	While the literature presents obviously competing narratives that explain disease outbreaks , a close examination of these reveals a high prevalence of certain narratives , which reflect the influence of power and privilege	1
5873	Hence , some of the literature has called for increased representation of the narratives from the most marginalized populations who bear the brunt of epidemics , in the scholarly literature ( Dry and Leach 2010 ; Nightingale 2010 ) .	1
5874	Although the data suggest that @DISEASE$ prevails and replicates in M	1
5875	rubra and that it also occurs in field - collected samples , it provides no insights on pathogenicity	1
5876	Neither abnormalities in colony development nor individual clinical symptoms in workers were observed	1

5942	In the study presented here , we used active screening to estimate the incidence of laboratory - confirmed influenzaassociated PICU admissions in one of Germany ' s largest federal states during the first three post - pandemic seasons	1
5943	Furthermore , we described the clinical characteristics of @DISEASE$ patients and compared patients with severe @DISEASE$ disease between the post - pandemic seasons .	1
5944	Within the CNS , @DISEASE$ mainly infected neurons [ 99 , 128 ] , which is also the case in lethal @DISEASE$ of humans [ 142 ]	1
5945	Although neurons remain the main target cell of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ have been shown in post mortem human brains [ 142 , 143 ]	1
5946	In vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion o@GENE$ N after @DISEASE$ infection , which is able to protect neighboring astrocytes and neurons from infection already 6 and 3 h post infection , respectively [ 100 ]	1

5955	Although there is substantial evidence that viral infection influences the URT bacterial community , whether these changes are reflected in the LRT and ultimately in @DISEASE$ etiology is unclear , which weakens our first hypothesis ( i	1
5956	e	1
5957	respiratory viruses can influence the etiology of @DISEASE$ by altering bacterial carriage structure in the URT )	1
5958	Studies that examine the joint effects of viral coinfection , @DISEASE$ carriage and @DISEASE$ would provide one strategy for filling this gap	1
5959	However , we found only two such studies	1
5960	In a South African hospital - based surveillance study of severe @DISEASE$ , 969 nasopharyngeal - oropharyngeal specimens were tested for S	1
5961	pneumoniae and a panel of respiratory viruses	1
5962	A high pneumococcal colonization density in the nasopharynx and oropharynx was associated with both @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 86 ]	1
5963	A second hospital - based casecontrol study compared nasopharyngeal carriage among 274 radiologically confirmed cases of @DISEASE$ , 276 cases of other @DISEASE$ and 350 controls in Vietnam	1
5964	Their findings for S	1
5965	pneumoniae were similar to that of the South African study	1
5966	However , the investigators also studied H	1
5967	influenzae and M	1
5968	catarrhalis and found no clear association between viral co - infection , nasopharyngeal bacterial load and @DISEASE$ for these species [ 87 ]	1
5969	As noted above , M	1
5970	catarrhalis rarely causes @DISEASE$ , but H	1
5971	influenzae is second only to S	1
5972	pneumoniae	1
5973	Although there appears to be a persuasive argument for a link between viral co - infection , carriage and @DISEASE$ for S	1
5974	pneumoniae , whether or why the interaction is not true for other URT bacteria needs further exploration	1
5975	In particular , studies that can directly test whether viral infection led to bacterial colonization or overgrowth by a potential pathogen , which led to @DISEASE$ by that pathogen , are in order	1
5976	In conclusion , there is no definitive answer to our first hypothesis	1
5977	Epidemiologic studies and experiments indicate viruses alter the bacterial community in the URT , but they do not yet adequately address whether these changes in the URT bacterial community play a significant role in @DISEASE$ etiology .	1
5978	In conclusion , the use of appropriate chemistries and software allowed straightforward development of two multiplex assays that allow fast processing of samples while simultaneously producing more reliable results ( and at a reduced cost ) than published assays	1
5979	Increased sensitivity had provided new information about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the target pathogens	1
5980	While these new assays have specific benefits for epidemiological investigations into the diseases of squirrels , it is hoped this work will have a wider impact by stimulating development of further multiplex qPCRs that will maximise information collected from investigations into multi - pathogen systems , which are becoming increasingly important as knowledge of co - infection dynamics increases ( Telfer et al	1

6016	The case reported no @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ during hospitalization or quarantine ( Table 2 ) .	1
6017	In the H9 - group , laying rates decreased to 65	1

6022	After the sham infection , birds in the control group recorded laying performances in the range of 95	1

6024	5 %	1
6025	Statistical analyses indicate that the difference in egg production between the two groups was significant ( P < 0	1
6026	05 ) for 9 weeks after the challenge .	1
6027	The sensitivity of the method , defined by the lowest concentration of the virus detected in all of the replicates in one RRT - PCR assay , was 10 4	1
6028	1 copies / µL for @GENE$ .	1
6029	Approximately 18 % of Adv group patients had no response to antipyretic treatment , which represented a higher proportion compared with that observed in the Non - Adv or unknown pathogen group patients ( P < 0	1
6030	001 )	1
6031	However , the proportion of complete response to antipyretic treatment was comparatively lower in patients in the Adv group than that observed in the Non - Adv or unknown pathogen groups .	1
6032	By using models to predict the observed global emergence of @DISEASE$ , we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information	1
6033	Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large , it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage ( pandemic H1N1 ) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage ( H3N2 ) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of @DISEASE$ appears to be air travel itself	1
6034	Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric , thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread , which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of @DISEASE$	1
6035	Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques , e	1
6036	g	1
6037	[ 35 ] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings	1
6038	Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread , as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel @DISEASE$ lineage in China [ 36 ]	1
6039	Should this virus evolve sustained human - to - human transmissibility , then airline - passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular , would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk	1
6040	If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts , however , risk maps for the transmission of @DISEASE$ ( perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza ) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts	1
6041	In conclusion , our framework is applicable to different @DISEASE$ and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity .	1
6042	Because most @GENE$ do not serve essential housekeeping functions , they can be lost during periods when selective pressures are relieved , for example during periods when fewer relevant viral pathogens are prevalent in the population	1
6043	In contrast , selection to increase the breadth of antiviral specificities could also lead to increase in gene copy number [ 34 ]	1
6044	As a result of these repeated rounds of innovations , many organisms undergo dramatic changes in their @GENE$ over evolutionary timeframes , as has been observed with @GENE$ in mammals [ 38 , 39 ]	1
6045	In our initial evolutionary screen , we had observed that most of @GENE$ is missing from the @GENE$	1
6046	Coupled with previous findings of @GENE$ absence in the @GENE$ [ 10 ] , we therefore investigated @GENE$ in general , with an emphasis on the @GENE$ , for signatures of rapid gene turnover .	1
6047	The current study was undertaken with two objectives : One is to demonstrate the utility of a biologist ' s friendly high performance computing workflow system in analyzing large and complex biological datasets by deploying compute intensive algorithms in their parallelized ver - sion	1
6048	The second objective is to analyze H5N1 _ NA data , as a proof of concept , in such a workflow to understand the molecular evolution of this rapidly evolving virus .	1
6049	HMPV causes @DISEASE$ presenting as mild @DISEASE$ or life - threatening severe @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ primarily in children , sometimes adults as well as immunocompromised individuals [ 2 ]	1
6050	However , HMPV genome sequence data from Africa is sparse and information on genome - wide diversity is limited	1
6051	In the present study , the whole genome sequences of five HMPV strains from Kenya and Zambia were determined and compared with the genomes published previously from around the world	1
6052	Comparative sequence analysis indicated fairly conserved positioning of the gene - start and - end regions as well@GENE$ nd codons .@GENE$ uences can have@GENE$ iption initiation and termination efficiency so that there is more selective pressure preventing changes in these regions [ 20 ] , and this likely explains our observation	1
6053	The additional ATG start codon found upstream of the @GENE$ if of the SH gene was @GENE$ revious@GENE$ [ 21 ] , though its role in gene expression is yet to be identified .	1
6054	Polyamines are small positively - charged molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that are crucial to RNA virus replication	1
6055	In eukaryotic cells , polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription , translation , and DNA replication , and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation	1
6056	Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood	1
6057	@DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ ( CVB3 ) , are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo ; however , precisely how polyamine function in @DISEASE$ infection has not been described	1
6058	Here , we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine - depleted conditions	1
6059	We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C protea@GENE$ at these mutant proteases@GENE$ e to polyamine depletion	1
6060	Using a split luciferase repor@GENE$ to measure protease activit@GENE$ termined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activit@GENE$ rther observe that the 2A and 3C protea@GENE$ e reporter protease activit@GENE$ amine - depleted conditions	1
6061	Finally , we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G d@GENE$  of polyamine - depleted cells	1
6062	In sum , our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease functio@GENE$ @DISEASE$ infection	1
6063	Further , these data highlight viral proteases as @GENE$ ral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine - depleting antiviral therapies	1
6064	Viral proteases pla@GENE$ ing infection , and picornaviruses encode two distinct proteases : 2A ( 2A@GENE$  3@GENE$  3@GENE$ 	1

6067	To date , reports demonstrated that 2A facilitates the @GENE$ avage between the P1 and P2 protein s@GENE$ e regulation of these proteases , their a@GENE$ , and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood	1
6068	However , due to their copious functions during infection , they represent potential drug targets [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .	1
6069	As also found in dogs , FeL does not exclude the possibility of concurrent diseases or co - infections	1
6070	This fact may influence the clinical presentation and prognosis	1
6071	The cause - effect relationship between various etiological and pathogenic factors is not always easy to establish [ 21 ] .	1
6072	6	1
6073	What are the most common clinical findings of @DISEASE$ due to L	1
6074	infantum ? Detailed case reports of @DISEASE$ have been available in recent years mainly from European countries where pet cats typically have a higher standard of health care	1
6075	In the New World , other @DISEASE$ spp	1
6076	are endemic and may co - infect cats and complicate the clinical picture [ 28 ]	1
6077	Therefore , we have only reviewed case reports or case series originally from European countries	1
6078	A total of 46 clinical cases have been published between 1989 and 2014 , where the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ was confirmed by serological and / or parasitological methods [ 11 - 14 , 21 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 50 - 67 ] .	1
6079	H 2 treatment suppressed LPS - induced activation in primary cultured astrocyte	1
6080	Because the over - activation of immune cells , including astrocytes , could have an adverse effect on neurons with the overproduction of @GENE$ 34 , we investigated the anti - inflammatory effect of H 2 on astrocyte using primary cultured astrocyte	1
6081	As shown in Fig	1
6082	5 , stimulation of astrocytes with LPS for three hours led to marked increases in @GENE$ r @GENE$ - α ) ( p < 0	1
6083	001 @GENE$  1β ( p < 0	1
6084	001 ) , @GENE$ - 6 ( p < 0	1

6086	These increases in expression@GENE$ - α ( p < 0	1
6087	01 @GENE$  1β ( p < 0	1
6088	001 ) @GENE$ - 6 ( p < 0	1
6089	05 ) were significantly attenuated by H 2 treatment	1
6090	Altered gene expression patterns in primary cultured astrocytes from the Control group , the LPS group , and the HW + LPS group	1
6091	As we previously described the gene expression profile of microglia 12 , differential gene expression patterns of astrocytes from newborn mice in the Control group , the LPS group , and the HW + LPS group were also observed ( Tables S1 - S4 , Supplementary Information )	1
6092	These results suggest that H 2 might also influence the function not only of microglia but also of astrocytes via changes in gene expression .	1
6093	Despite the putative advantages of qPCR assays , only 35 % ( 48 / 136 ) of reviewed studies of wildlife disease surveillance published since 2011 have used qPCR ; furthermore , only 8 % ( 7 / 88 ) and 11 % ( 5 / 45 ) of conventional PCR and qPCR studies , respectively , used an IC	1
6094	Use of a multiplex reaction was similarly limited , accounting for only 14 % ( 12 / 88 ) and 10 % ( 4 / 39 ) , respectively , of wildlife disease surveillance studies	1
6095	The implication is that contemporary techniques in molecular epidemiology are underutilised in wildlife disease surveillance ( see also Benton et al	1
6096	2015 ) .	1
6097	In 66 % of the control patients and 82 % of the IVIG - treated patients , one or more pathogens could be identified as the cause of @DISEASE$	1
6098	In 11 ( 38 % ) patients in the control group , bacterial pathogens such as Legionella ( n = 1 ; 3 % ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 1 ; 3 % ) , Pneumocystis jirovecii ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) , and E	1
6099	coli ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) were identified in BAL samples	1
6100	None of the control patients showed multidrug - resistant bacteria in any samples	1
6101	In 28 % ( 8 of 29 ) of the control patients , a viral pathogen was detected in BAL samples : influenza ( n = 3 ; 10 % ) and @DISEASE$ ( n = 6 ; 21 % )	1
6102	@DISEASE$ included HSV ( n = 5 ; 17 % ) and CMV ( n = 2 ; 7 % )	1
6103	@DISEASE$ was confirmed by cell - based culture	1
6104	In five of the control patients , @DISEASE$ was diagnosed via blood culture ( n = 1 ) , abdominal sample ( n = 2 ) , and BAL ( Aspergillus , n = 2 )	1
6105	In nine control patients , no causal pathogen could be identified ( 31 % ) .	1
6106	Since finding the MFE pseudoknotted secondary structure is NP - hard [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] , polynomial time MFE - based methods for prediction of pseudoknotted secondary structures predict a restricted class of pseudoknotted structures [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]	1
6107	These methods trade off run - time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict	1
6108	For example , the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [ 33 ] , whose running time is ( n 6 ) on inputs of length n , is not practical for @GENE$ of length more than 100 nucleotides	1
6109	This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]	1
6110	Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure , they usually run faster than the MFE - based methods that handle the same class of structures	1
6111	For example , @GENE$ V2	1
6112	0 [ 36 , 41 ] is a heuristic approach that uses carefully trained energy parameters , is guided by energy minimization and can handle @GENE$	1
6113	However , @GENE$ is still slow on long sequences .	1
6114	Additionally , to reduce the complexity of the peptide mixtures , reverse - phase chromatography using a RIGOL L - 3000 system was applied for separating the peptides	1
6115	The labeled peptide mixtures were dissolved in 100 μ L of mobile phase A [ 2 % acetonitrile in ddH 2 O , pH 10 ] and centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 20 min prior to loading onto the column	1
6116	Samples were eluted by injection of stepwise gradients of mobile phase B [ 2 % ddH 2 O in acetonitrile , pH 10 ] , with a flow rate set at 700 μ L / min	1
6117	Each fraction was eluted for 1	1
6118	5 min	1
6119	Analysis by Q - Exactive mass spectrometry	1
6120	The fractionated peptide mixtures were analysed by a Q - Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY - nLC 1000 System ( Thermo Fisher Scientific )	1
6121	The spray voltage , capillary temperature , and declustering potential of the source ionisation parameters were set as 2	1
6122	1 kV , 250 ° C , and 100 V , respectively .	1
6123	What ' s more , we enriched a panel of 29 proteins that are associated with @GENE$ by Metacore TM software , as shown in Fig	1
6124	5	1
6125	As @GENE$ is known as an important @GENE$ , these proteins could be related to @DISEASE$ development	1
6126	For instance@GENE$ I5 was enriched in this network , and t@GENE$ I5 expression level was reduced in F81 cells at 48 hpi and 60 hpi@GENE$ I5 is @GENE$ in that can suppre@GENE$ 2F - dependent apoptosis 44	1
6127	It is frequently up - regulated in @DISEASE$ cells and functions as a master regulat@GENE$ mmune escape genes in @DISEASE$ 45	1
6128	Based on these fin@GENE$ s , CPV may be a powerful apoptosis - modulating agent that could down - r@GENE$ te API5 gene expression .	1
6129	Nurse ( N6 ) also commented that : " Hmmm we believe that for now we just need a special support from the management and all @DISEASE$ programme leaders , to give us more knowledge and skills on @DISEASE$	1
6130	" Nurse ( N3 ) indicated that : " I believe that as a nurse it is more crucial that we have meetings with the doctors and other management staff	1
6131	"	1
6132	Hospitalized patients require more than a dozen daily medications that are administered at various hours and in multiple ways	1
6133	Although physicians have the responsibilities to diagnose infections and prescribe medications for patients , nurses are responsible for actively caring , feeding , bathing , and dispensing medication for hospitalized patients throughout the day	1
6134	Nurses are on the front line of fighting all kinds of diseases in the world , and they risk their lives to provide quality healthcare services in the hospital .	1
6135	As the percentage of nodes sampled decreases , the number of movements and nodes captured is observed to decrease for all sampling methods ( figure 1 )	1
6136	As the network fragments , the size of the @GENE$ decreases while the number of strongly connected components increases	1
6137	Both the TNS and SBS sampling schemes outperform the RNS scheme in preserving robustness across all measured statistics as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases ( figure 1 )	1
6138	Within the giant component , the mean degree and degree standard deviation remain robust with approximately 15 - 20 % of the data for both TNS and SBS .	1
6139	As the transmission rate of the disease increases , epidemic sizes increase and a higher percentage of nodes are required for all sampling methods to make accurate predictions	1
6140	For example when b ¼ 2 , 25 % of the nodes must be sampled using the TNS method and 50 % for the SBS method to predict the overall epidemic size for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria , whereas for the RNS method almost all nodes must be sampled to capture epidemic behaviour ( electronic supplementary material , figure S13 )	1
6141	As the infectious period of the disease increases , a higher percentage of nodes needs to be sampled , but the effect of this is less pronounced than a variation in the transmission rate ( electronic supplementary material , figures S14 and S15 )	1
6142	For diseases with a very high transmission rate , a much higher percentage of nodes must be sampled for all methods , even when the infectious period is short ( electronic supplementary material , figure S16 )	1
6143	When we include within - market transmission into our model , we observe significantly larger epidemic sizes , with the mean epidemic size after one infectious period when b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 being 2266 farms for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria	1
6144	The TNS and SBS methods under - predict epidemic sizes when less than 35 % and 50 % respectively of the nodes are sampled ( electronic supplementary material , figure S7 )	1
6145	In contrast to the scenario where markets do not amplify transmission , the RMS method predicts epidemic sizes accurately even when only a very small number ( approx	1
6146	20 % ) of movements are sampled	1
6147	This suggests that , if a significant level of transmission is thought to occur within markets , then either TNS or RMS would be the preferred strategies if only limited resources were available	1
6148	Similar results are observed for outbreaks seeded in Devon and Aberdeenshire .	1
6149	Analysis of codon usage and nucleotide composition bias in @DISEASE$ 	1
6150	Among the 11 @GENE$ , 6 were found in G , 2 found M and 1 in each of N , P and L	1
6151	Two pairs of @GENE$ , ( 4593 , 4596 ) Data from Illumina sequencing were used to test the hypothesis that @GENE$ that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies in the historical samples than those @GENE$ that did not	1
6152	Loci shown in Figure 5 where inversion of the @GENE$ occurred between the historical and later samples are referred to as ' ' @GENE$ ' '	1
6153	The frequencies of @GENE$ at the @GENE$ were compared to that of variants at @GENE$ - inversion sites present in the 1995 samples ( but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003 / 10 samples ) to determine if those variants at @GENE$ were present in higher numbers in the pre - outbreak samples	1
6154	The average frequency of @GENE$ at @GENE$ was slightly but significantly higher than that of @GENE$ at @GENE$ ( p = 0	1
6155	03 , twosample t - test one - tailed )	1
6156	Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak ( prior to July1 , 2009 ) had increased likelihood to have the @GENE$ detected at the @GENE$ as a @GENE$ , although the difference fell short of statistical significance ( p = 0	1
6157	08 ) .	1
6158	ETEC is the most common cause of @DISEASE$ in pigs	1

6160	Reducing burden of disease from residential indoor air exposures in Europe ( HEALTHVENT project ) Reducing burden of disease from residential indoor air exposures in Europe ( HEALTHVENT project )	1
6161	We collected 571 pig swab samples from pigs present around the house of 22 of 23 cases , 28 of 41 community controls and 13 of 33 hospital controls respectively , who kept pigs around the house ( Table 3 )	1
6162	The median herd size was 7 pigs ( range , 1 to 50 )	1
6163	S	1
6164	suis serotype 2 was detected in 9 ( 41 % ) case group herds , 3 ( 23 % ) hospital control group herds , and 5 ( 18 % ) matched community control group herds	1
6165	Differences between case group and control groups were not statistically significant ( Table 5 ) .	1
6166	We were unable to demonstrate S	1
6167	suis serotype 2 carriage in 1522 healthy persons or patients without @DISEASE$ , including those with pig exposures	1
6168	In contrast , 6 / 101 ( 6 % ) of patients had PCR positive swab samples , a rate similar to what was found in slaughterhouse workers in Germany [ 16 ]	1
6169	Eating pig intestines in the few days prior to admission was reported in 3 / 6 of the patients with a PCR positive throat or rectal swab , two of which were also culture positive	1
6170	Taken together , rather than indicating human carriage of S	1
6171	suis serotype 2 , our results strengthen the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract may be a route of entry for at least a proportion of patients .	1
6172	Previous reports have shown that @GENE$ plays a role in degradation of @GENE$ by an ubiquitin - proteasomal - dependent pathway	1
6173	To determine whether @GENE$ plays a similar role during @DISEASE$ infection , Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid expre@GENE$ xCul4 and infected with @DISEASE$ 24 h post - transfection	1
6174	Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real - time RT - qPCR was performed using @GENE$ rs f@GENE$ porter gene r@GENE$  Jak - STAT pathway [@GENE$  and@GENE$ porter gene regul@GENE$ TRAF - Rel2 pathway [ 35 ]	1
6175	As expected , express@GENE$ both@GENE$  and CxVago was upregulated following @DISEASE$ infection	1
6176	However , whilst there was no signific@GENE$ ference in CxVago exp@GENE$  following CxCul4@GENE$ pression , CxVir1 upregulation was suppressed significantly in CxCul4 - overexpressing cells compared with empty vector transfected cells ( Fig 4A )	1
6177	Previous studies have shown that ,@GENE$ xpressed , CxVago is secreted @GENE$ es the Jak - STAT pathway in Culex cells [ 7 ]	1
6178	Therefore , Hsu cells were@GENE$ ected with CxVago and the supernatant medium was collected 72 h post - transfection	1
6179	Fresh Hsu cells were then tra@GENE$ xpression plasmid and , at 24 h post - transfection , the medium was replaced with @GENE$ containing CxVag@GENE$ te the Jak - STAT pathway	1

6182	The mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp	1
6183	hungarica and Athamanta turbith ssp	1
6184	haynaldii are rich in essential oils , myristicin being the main component of both oils [ 84 ]	1
6185	The capacity for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was evaluated and the authors found that both oils had similar ability	1
6186	When the activity was evaluated by the DPPH method , the authors reported that Athamanta turbith ssp	1
6187	hungarica was the most effective , albeit with less ability than the references used ( quercetin and ascorbic acid ) [ 84 ] .	1
6188	The antioxidant activity of Pistacia atlantica Desf	1
6189	leaf oils from diverse origins of Algeria showed weak ability for scavenging DPPH free radicals , at least when compared to those of references ( BHT and BHA )	1
6190	In contrast , the same oils had a higher antioxidant capacity relative to the antioxidant of reference ascobic acid when measured through the FRAP assay [ 78 ]	1
6191	In the same assay , the authors also reported diverse activities depending on the harvesting place	1
6192	The best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat , mainly constituted by α - pinene + α - thujene , camphene and spathulenol .	1

6204	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) has gained considerable recognition as a major global public health threat [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]	1
6205	The impact of @DISEASE$ has been described as a " doomsday scenario " where antibiotics can no longer be relied upon and even minor infections could become untreatable and result in severe morbidity , death and significant economic losses [ 1 , 4 , 5 ]	1
6206	The World Health Organization ( WHO ) released a Global Action Plan for @DISEASE$ in 2015 , setting out five strategic objectives to combat @DISEASE$ [ 2 ]	1
6207	It also highlighted the importance of a " One Health " approach , requiring collaboration among	1
6208	Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a novel , but now widely applied , method for the detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samples	1
6209	Compared with conventional methods , PCR has significantly increased sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis [ 13 , 14 ] and has also demonstrated high specificity [ 15 , 16 ]	1
6210	Viral etiology data for @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) from developing countries based on molecular diagnostic methods are scarce , however , and no such studies have to our knowledge been conducted over several years and on a large number of children .	1
6211	The proportions of the components present in essential oils vary greatly	1
6212	Major components can constitute up to 85 % of the essential oils , while the remaining components can be present in only trace OPEN ACCESS communication between plants [ 3 , 13 ]	1
6213	The detection of some of these biological properties needed for the survival of plants has also been the base for searching similar properties for the combat of several microorganisms responsible for some @DISEASE$ in humans and animals	1
6214	This search intends to respond to the increasing resistance of pathogenic microbes to antibiotics	1
6215	Reichling et al	1
6216	( 2009 ) [ 14 ] have compiled the most important results about antibacterial and antiviral properties of essential oils published in the last decade	1
6217	In this review , the essential oils against bacteria from the respiratory tract , anti - Helicobacter pylori , anti - Mycoplasma pneumoniae ; essential oils against DNA virus : HSV1 ( herpes simplex virus ) , HSV - 2 , NDV ( @DISEASE$ ) ; or RNA virus : SARS - Cov ( severe @DISEASE$ ) , and @DISEASE$ were overviewed	1
6218	In addition , essential oils have also revealed to be effective on the inhibition of growth and reduction in numbers of the more serious foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella spp	1

6232	With a view to fostering further deliberation and constructive debate , we are proposing a conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures in @DISEASE$ ( see Figure 1 )	1
6233	Building upon previous theoretical work on the justification for public health intervention [ 25 ] , our model is designed to reflect the dynamic interplay among theory , empirical evidence , and policy / practice that is inherent to public health	1
6234	To that end , we have incorporated the empirical data from the public opinion survey described in this paper	1
6235	The model explicitly contemplates the four primary functions of public health as regards the use of restrictive measures in @DISEASE$ outbreaks , namely , response , enforcement , support , and oversight	1
6236	For instance , with respect to the enforcement of quarantine orders , the model illustrates how the specific function of enforcement aligns with the ethical principle of the ' least restrictive means ' and is likewise concordant with empirical evidence indicating strong public support for the use of sanctions to promote compliance with quarantine orders ( survey data reported here )	1
6237	This conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures in @DISEASE$ emergencies should be considered provisional and , as such , is open to further testing and refinement .	1
6238	The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty , University of Würzburg , Germany .	1
6239	To determine whether increased mortality caused by PLX5622 treatment is associated with increased viral replication in peripheral or CNS tissues , tissue viral loads were assessed by plaque assay , and serum viral loads were determined by quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 days post - infection ( dpi )	1
6240	In the CNS , virus was first detected in the olfactory bulb ( Fig	1
6241	2e ) , then sequentially in more caudal regions including the cortex ( Fig	1
6242	2f ) , cerebellum ( Fig	1
6243	2g ) , brainstem ( Fig	1
6244	2h ) , and spinal cord ( Fig	1
6245	2i )	1
6246	Compared with control - treated animals , PLX5622 - treated mice exhibited higher viral titers in the olfactory bulb and cortex at 6 and 8 dpi and in the cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord at 8 dpi ; however , viral titers were also significantly higher in peripheral tissues of PLX5622 - treated mice including the spleen at 4 dpi ( Fig	1
6247	2j ) , kidney at 4 and 6 dpi ( Fig	1
6248	2k ) , and serum at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi ( Fig	1
6249	2l )	1
6250	PLX5622 treatment did not cause increased BBB permeability in infected mice ( Additional file 5 )	1
6251	Once WNV - NY enters the CNS via intracranial ( i	1
6252	c	1
6253	) inoculation , PLX5622 treatment did not affect neuronal permissivity to infection ( Additional file 6 )	1
6254	Together , these data indicate a loss of immune - mediated virologic control in both peripheral and CNS tissues in CSF1R antagonist - treated mice , consistent with prior data suggesting that @GENE$ signaling plays important roles in the function of both peripheral and CNS myeloid cells [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] .	1
6255	Of the 610 cats diagnosed with @DISEASE$ , 528 ( 87 % ) had never been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination history	1
6256	Sixty - five of the 82 ( 79 % ) cats that had received at least one vaccination were < 16 weeks of age at the time of their last vaccination	1
6257	For 17 cats ≥ 16 weeks of age at the time of last vaccination , the vaccination - to - disease interval was > 10 days for 4 / 5 cats vaccinated with ≥ 2 inactivated vaccines and > 7 days for 7 / 11 cats vaccinated with at least one MLV vaccine ; vaccine type was unknown for one cat	1
6258	For all vaccinated cats , the median time from last vaccination to diagnosis was 7	1

6260	We have used the iLIR web resource ( https : / / ilir	1

6269	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , a novel infectious agent causing severe @DISEASE$ and death in humans , was first described in 2012	1
6270	Antibodies directed against the MERS - CoV spike ( S ) protein are thought to @GENE$ g @DISEASE$ and in mediating vaccine - induced protective immunity	1
6271	In contrast , relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS - CoV that are recognized by CD8 + T cells	1
6272	In this study , the highly conserved MERS - CoV nucleocapsid ( N ) protein served as a target @GENE$ fic cellular immune responses	1
6273	Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , a safety - tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research , was used for generating MVA - MERS - N expressing recombinant N protein .@GENE$ 	1
6274	Conclusions : Our results demonstrate the impact of @GENE$ antagonism on @DISEASE$ activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following @DISEASE$	1
6275	These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antago@GENE$  which has been investigated as a therapeutic for @DISEASE$ , in which @DISEASE$ is a contributing factor .	1
6276	Recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N was formed in CEF that were infected with MVA and transfected with the MVA vector plasmid @GENE$ ( Figure 1a )	1
6277	The @GENE$ in @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) targeted the insertion of the @GENE$ into the site of @GENE$ III within the @GENE$	1
6278	The clonal isolation was facilitated by co - production of the red fluorescent reporter protein @GENE$ allowing for the convenient detection of MVA - MERS - N infected cells during plaque purification	1
6279	The @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) served to remove the marker gene @GENE$ from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination ( @GENE$ deletion )	1
6280	After PCR analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95 % MVA - MERS - N recombinant viruses in the cultures , we selected the final marker - free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without @GENE$ fluorescence	1
6281	To confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous @GENE$ within the @GENE$ , we analyzed @GENE$ by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for @GENE$ adjacent to the @GENE$ ( Figure 1b In addition , the comparative Western blot analysis of cell lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF with @GENE$ suggested the production of comparable amounts of both @GENE$ ( Figure 2b )	1
6282	This observation is in line with the fact that the MVA - MERS - S candidate vector vaccine expresses the @GENE$ using the identical @GENE$ system [ 23 ]	1
6283	As shown in previous studies , we detected two @GENE$ upon infection with MVA - MERS - S indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full - length @GENE$ ( ~ @GENE$ ) into an @GENE$ ( ~ @GENE$ ) and a @GENE$ ( ~ 85 kDa S2 domain ; not detected ) subunit [ 23 , 50 , 51 ]	1
6284	Following this , we used the total protein lysates from MVA - MERS - N or MVA - MERS - S infected CEF to assess the recognition of the MERS - CoV N and S antigens by sera from experimentally MERS - CoV infected animals	1
6285	The Western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit ( Figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey ( Figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the MERS - CoV N protein	1
6286	The recognition of the MERS - CoV N protein was at least as prominent as the MERS - CoV S antigen , which was suggestive of the induction of substantial N - specific antibody responses after experimental MERS - CoV infections .	1
6287	Upregulation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the CNS and peripheral tissues after virulent 5746 infection in transgenic mice was reported by our previous works	1
6288	This is also corresponds to the clinical findings where @GENE$ increased in patients with EV71 [ 19 ]	1
6289	Higher expression of @GENE$ observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes ( neutrophils ) during @DISEASE$	1

6300	The impact of recipients ' viral load on HCV recurrence following LT is still uncertain , but a clear understanding of HCV kinetics after LT will contribute to the development of strategies to prevent @DISEASE$ of the allograft	1
6301	An earlier study , which analyzed HCV kinetics during and immediately after LT , found a sharp decrease in HCV viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion [ 3 ]	1
6302	This decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes	1
6303	In other words , reinfection is immediate after reperfusion	1

6307	The authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation , and began to rise as soon as 15 hours after the anhepatic phase	1
6308	Moreover , the viral load reached a plateau before rising , suggesting that a nonhepatic source supplied virions and balanced their intrinsic clearance	1
6309	It was estimated that nonhepatic sources were at most responsible for 4 % of total viral production and the remaining 96 % occurred in the liver .	1

6314	This assay is considered to be a more sensitive test compare to virus neutralization assay	1
6315	6 , 7 The MERS - S pseudoparticles were used in a pseudoparticle neutralization test ( ppNT ) as first described elsewhere	1
6316	6 In brief , the ppNT assay included infecting monolayers of Vero E6 cells ( ATCC CRL - 1586 ) in a single well ( 96 - well plate format ; 1 9 10 4 cells / well ) with HIV - MERS - S - pseudotyped lentiviral vector having 5 ng p@GENE$  The MERS - S pseudoparticles were pre - incubated with serially diluted sera for 60 min at 4 ° C and then added to the cells in triplicate	1

6319	Endpoint M@GENE$ iters were determined as the highest serum dilution resulting in 90 % reduction of l@GENE$ elative to a negative serum ( BSA ) control	1
6320	Polyclonal rabbit antisera to MERS - CoV obtained from the NIH / NIAID Rocky Mountain Research Laboratory was used as a positive control	1
6321	Sensitivity of the assay in our laboratory was compared to that of the Peiris Laboratory at University of Hong Kong , where it was developed , by shipping an aliquot of this positive control which was independently titrated in the ppNT assay	1
6322	Both our and Peiris ' laboratory found the neutralizing titer of the polyclonal rabbit sera to be comparable to that measured by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories live virus neutralization assay ( 1 : 2560 ) .	1

6339	To further bolster the claim of viral persistence in wild bats , a population level study was performed to understand the circulation of zoonotic viruses in bat populations and the involved immune mechanisms ( maternal antibody and acquired immune response ) using mathematical modelling [ 45 ]	1
6340	The study used sero - surveillance of an African @DISEASE$ in straw - colored fruit bats ( Eidolon helvum )	1
6341	While repeated introduction of virus and birthing of pups might drive viral dynamics in a large panmictic population of bats , prolonged infectious periods or latent infection of bats are required to explain @DISEASE$ persistence in small populations ( natural or colony of captive )	1
6342	They found that if repeated introduction of virus into small populations was the only mechanism , then acute infections would have to be ~ 40 days in duration	1
6343	This estimate is considerably longer than the current estimates of the detectable infectious period for @DISEASE$ in fruit bats , which is approximately 7 days [ 46 ]	1
6344	Therefore , prolonged or latent infection has to occur in some bats for describing persistence of @DISEASE$ in small populations .	1
6345	Consistent with previous observations , recent experiments performed in mammalian cells using IBV showed that this avian coronavirus is also capable of inducing autophagy during infection [ 55 ] .	1
6346	Although any cell can produce @GENE$ in response to infection , the acute systemic response to viruses has been attributed to production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ' s , also known as interferon - producing cells or IPC ) [ 23 , 24 , 25 ] , which comprise only a minor subpopulation of cells but can produce 1000 times as much @GENE$ as other cells [ 24 ]	1
6347	Conventional DC ' s can also produce high amounts of @GENE$ if they are directly infected , but pDC ' s are uniquely able to secrete high levels of @GENE$ in response to @GENE$	1
6348	The role of pDC ' s in production of @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ infection was investigated by depleting mice of pDC ' s the day before @DISEASE$ infect@GENE$ ng antibody [@GENE$ plasma IFNa response at 16 hours postinfection with @DISEASE$ , as measured by ELISA , was abolished by pDC depletion ( Figure 3A )	1

6365	g001 that in vivo upregulation of CD69 on lymphocytes is likely due to the systemic IFNa response to LDV infection	1
6366	Interestingly , the loss of the IFNa response in pDC - depleted mice produced no statistically significant difference in LDV plasma levels as measured by real time PCR ( 15 ) ( Figure 3C )	1
6367	Since IFNa can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to limit virus replication and spread [ 27 ] , it appears that LDV is quite resistant to the antiviral effects of IFNa , even when present at very high systemic levels .	1
6368	The results suggest that ( i ) there is a substantial burden of disease associated with exposures through inhalation taking place indoors and that ( ii ) these risks can Largest health benefits were projected for the source control policies	1
6369	It is obvious that the benefits are achievable only if the source controls work as efficiently as proposed and that the efficiency of the source controls must be confirmed with follow - up ( e	1

6372	To pinpoint the cause for G0 / G1 accumulation upon EV - D68 infection , we analyzed the transitions from G0 / G1 into S and from G2 / M into G0 / G1	1
6373	After cell cycle release from G0 / G1 , mock - infected cells entered S phase , while EV - D68 - infected cells still accumulated at G0 / G1 phase , thus demonstrating that EV - D68 infection prevents S phase entry from G0 / G1 phase	1
6374	Furthermore , after G2 / M synchronization , EV - D68 infection promoted cell cycle transition from G2 / M into G0 / G1 phase	1
6375	Therefore , EV - D68 infection regulates G0 / G1 cell cycle arrest both by promoting G0 / G1 phase entry and by inhibiting G0 / G1 phase departure	1
6376	To further analyze the mechanism of host cell cycle manipulation by EV - D68 , we assessed the expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ that are known to form complexes to regulate cell cycle progression ( Oosthuysen et al	1
6377	, 2015 )	1
6378	For example : @GENE$ and @GENE$ regulate G0 / G1 progression ( Massagué , 2004 ) ; @GENE$ regulates S - phase entry from G1 ( Hinds et al	1
6379	, 1992 ) ; @GENE$ regulates Sphase progression by replacing @GENE$ ( Coverley et al	1
6380	, 2002 ; Yam et al	1
6381	, 2002 ) ; and @GENE$ prevents cell cycle transition from G2 / M into G0 / G1 ( Yu et al	1
6382	, 2013 ; Adeyemi and Pintel , 2014 )	1
6383	We demonstrated that @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ are down - regulated after EV - D68 infection , which could explain the ability of EV - D68 to inhibit the transition from G0 / G1 to S phase	1
6384	Furthermore , the expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ was down - regulated after EV - D68 infection , which is consistent with the ability of EV - D68 to promoting the transition from G2 / M to G / G1	1
6385	Therefore , expression of cell cycle - related proteins further supports our results suggesting that EV - D68 induces G0 / G1 arrest by regulating G0 / G1 phase entry and exit	1
6386	We also analyzed whether the regulation of protein expression occurred at the mRNA level and found that CDK2 and CDK1 were down - regulated by EV - D68 , but that the other cell cycle proteins were not	1
6387	This indicates that the regulation of cellular factors related to the cell cycle by EV - D68 occurs partly at the transcriptional level , but mostly occurs at the post - translational level .	1
6388	Though the latter experiments were performed using the Fermon strain of EV - D68 , which was isolated from 4 children with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in the United States in 1962 ( Schieble et al	1
6389	, 1967 ; Zhang et al	1
6390	, 2015 ) , several more recent strains of the virus have been isolated	1
6391	The currently circulating EV - D68 US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 strains are similar to the Fermon strain in clinical characteristics and genome structure , but it is not known whether they are similar in virulence and ability to manipulate the cell cycle	1
6392	Therefore , we compared the US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 strains to the Fermon strain	1
6393	Under normal culture conditions , RD cells were infected with three strains virus at an MOI of 0	1
6394	8 for 24 h , respectively , the TCID50 / mL of the US / MO / 14 - 18947 strain ( 43	1
6395	07 ± 10	1
6396	22 × 10 5 ) was 29	1
6397	76 times higher and the TCID50 / mL of the US / KY / 14 - 18953 ( 195	1
6398	00 ± 54	1

6401	40 ± 0	1
6402	16 × 10 5 ) ( Figure 2B )	1
6403	These results suggest that the EV - D68 virulence has increased over time , which could explain the recent rise in the incidence of @DISEASE$ ( Esposito et al	1
6404	, 2015 ; Farrell et al	1

6408	Most diagnostic techniques for @DISEASE$ which are available for dogs are also employed in cats	1

6411	At the examination of the digestive tract , we observed the presence of fibrin and a yellowish exudate on the peritoneum of 4 / 7 and 5 / 7 of the birds , on days 4 and 6 pi , respectively .	1
6412	IHC analyses revealed the presence of the @GENE$ only in the oviduct , while the rest of the organs were negative ( Figure 3 ) .	1

6420	To test the hypothesis that @GENE$ were responsible for liver pathogenesis in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , we administered transgenic mouse serum intravenously into nontransgenic mice	1
6421	We observed the development of @DISEASE$ in the nontransgenic mice within 7 days after the serum transfer ( Figures 6B and C )	1

6431	Furthermore , to investigate whether TNF - a @GENE$  6 p@GENE$ articularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ in the transgenic mice , we neutralized TNF - a and bloc@GENE$ IL - 6 receptor @GENE$  these mice	1
6432	As expected , @DISEASE$ did not develop in these mice	1
6433	( Figure 6D and E ) .	1
6434	Tissue samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , embedded in paraffin , sectioned ( 4 - mm thickness ) , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E )	1
6435	Staining with periodic acid - Schiff stain , Azan stain , silver , or Oil - red - O was also performed to visualize @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ , respectively .	1
6436	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ virus inhibits cellular NF@GENE$ tivity by blocking ubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation of Iκ@GENE$  human @DISEASE$ cells	1
6437	Data was stored in a password - protected computer	1
6438	Access to the database was restricted to the researcher and supervisors only	1
6439	Data was stored as per university ' s protocols	1
6440	Any identifiable information that was collected remained confidential and was only accessible to the researcher and supervisors	1
6441	Data was analyzed in groups not individually to avoid identifying the participants by their responses	1
6442	Qualitative data analysis always takes place concurrently with data collection	1
6443	Therefore , the researcher attempted to gather , manage , and interpret a growing bulk of data simultaneously	1
6444	In this study , the audio - recorded interviews were transcribed and coded immediately after data collection	1
6445	Data was analyzed using Colaizzi ' s [ 12 ] methods which comprise the following seven steps :	1
6446	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) are @GENE$ that belong to the superfamily of @GENE$ , which also includes receptors for vitamin D , vitamin A , thyroid hormone , bile acids , and steroid hormones	1
6447	The @GENE$ comprises three isotypes , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , which play various roles in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism , cell proliferation and differentiation , and inflammation [ 132 , 133 ] .	1
6448	Artemisia fukudo Makino essential oil , mainly constituted by α - thujone , β - thujone , camphor , and caryophyllene attenuates @DISEASE$ - induced inflammation by suppre@GENE$  - κ@GENE$  MAPK activation in RAW 264	1

6451	The same oil also suppressed the LPS - induced activation of phosphorilati@GENE$ f @GENE$ , JN@GENE$ MAPKs [ 116 ] .	1
6452	Others have observed that polyamines contribute to @GENE$ activity [ 39 , 40 ]	1
6453	Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular @GENE$ activity and , as a result , leaf senescence [ 41 ]	1
6454	The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells , though	1
6455	For instance , spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of @GENE$ [ 32 , 33 ]	1
6456	Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of @GENE$ , especially @GENE$ , has not been fully explored ; however , our work suggests that @GENE$ may be modulated by polyamines .	1
6457	Our results suggest that for countries with similar farming practices , it may not be necessary to collect data on all livestock farms , but only those that contribute most significantly to the livestock trade	1
6458	Of course , this creates something of a conundrum - in order to sample the most highly connected nodes , and thus accurately represent epidemic risk on an unknown network , one needs to know which farms have the most movements	1
6459	One solution to this would be for all farmers to be required to record the number of movements they make in a given year	1
6460	These summary statistics could then be used to determine which farms should be sampled for the following year	1
6461	In the UK , at least , analysis of the movement network for multiple years suggests that those farms that have a high number of movements in a given year are more likely to have a high number of movements in the following year	1
6462	This method may therefore be used in countries where livestock movement data are not currently available in order to inform epidemic models and predict the potential for disease spread owing to animal movements in the early stages of a disease outbreak .	1
6463	extracts analyses using HPLC - UV were carried out in two parts	1
6464	The first part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in methanolic extracts of different parts of H	1
6465	littoralis , namely , root , bulb , stem , leaves , flower , and anther	1
6466	The second part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in callus extracts produced by using different combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators ( PGRs )	1
6467	Sample preparation for HPLC analysis was carried out by accurately weighing 2 mg of each dried extract , which was then dissolved in 2 mL of HPLC - grade methanol to give a concentration of 1 mg / mL	1
6468	These samples were then filtered through a 0	1
6469	45 m syringe filter ( Whatman , Maidstone , England ) and kept in fridge at − 20 ∘ C prior to HPLC analysis .	1
6470	Western blot analysis	1
6471	Cells were harvested and @GENE$ were extracted as mentioned above	1
6472	Total @GENE$ from different time points were separated by SDS - PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Whatman )	1
6473	The membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat milk powder dissolved in tris - buffered saline , containing 0	1
6474	05 % Tween - 20 , for 2 h at room temperature	1
6475	@GENE$ ( see below ) were diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 ° C	1
6476	Next , the membranes were incubated with the appropriate @GENE$ diluted in blocking buffer at 1 : 3000 for 2 h at room temperature	1
6477	Detected proteins were revealed using the ECL Detection Kit ( KeyGen Biotech ) .	1

6483	The potential of CpG ODN as prophylactic standalone inducers of innate defense mechanisms has been the subject of only few studies	1
6484	Most works in this field initially described protection of mice against bacterial [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] and parasitic [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] infections	1
6485	More recently , induction of resistance to @DISEASE$ was shown also in mouse models for @DISEASE$ [ 48 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 49 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 50 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 51 ]	1
6486	With exception of the latter , all these studies were carried out with CpG - B	1
6487	In an outbred species , partial antiviral pro@GENE$ has only been described in two studies so far , in which reduced shedding of @DISEASE$ was observed in lambs after administration also of a CpG - B [ 52 , 53 ]	1
6488	To our knowledge , prophylactic antiviral potential of C@GENE$ as not yet been described in outbred animals .@GENE$ 	1
6489	Following carrageenan injection into the rat paw , the systemic treatment with α - humulene and ( - ) trans - caryophyllene markedly inhibited the expression of both @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
6490	The possible mechanisms involved were not performed by the authors [ 114 ] .	1
6491	Viruses 2019 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 cloned a @GENE$ - @GENE$ - and a @GENE$ - AMEQG - into the @GENE$ [ 37 ]	1
6492	We also cloned @GENE$ and @GENE$ into the @GENE$ to drive robust @GENE$ expression	1
6493	These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO	1
6494	Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity	1
6495	We observed that for both @GENE$ ( Figure 4C ) and @GENE$ ( Figure 4D ) , @GENE$ activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 µM	1
6496	These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral @GENE$ activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral @GENE$ activity .	1
6497	@GENE$ partly co - localize on intracellular membranes with @GENE$ 	1
6498	While these mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO - treated cells , we wished to determine whether these mutations conferred resistance to polyamine depletion and were not a consequence of a pleiotropic effect from DFMO	1
6499	Toward this end , we treated cells with a different polyamine - depleting agent , diethylnorspermidine ( DENSpm ) , which acts to accelerate polyamine catabolism by acetylating spermidine and spermine	1

6502	At 48 hpi , we measured viral titers , and again we observed significant sensitivity with the wildtype virus ( Figure 2D )	1
6503	However , we observed partial resistance in our protease mutant viruses	1
6504	As with DFMO , when we calculated the percent replication in DENSpm - treated cells compared to untreated cells , the protease mutants exhibited resistance that was additive ( Figure 2E )	1
6505	We verified that both of these molecules were depleting polyamines in our treated cells by directly visualizing polyamines via thin - layer chromatography ( Figure 2F )	1

6530	However , in our previous study , we determined that G0 / G1 synchronization inhibits EV - A71 viral replication	1
6531	To exclude experimental variation as an explanation for the disparate responses of these viruses to G0 / G1 synchronization , we performed a side - by - side comparison of the two @DISEASE$	1
6532	Our results confirm that no serum treatment induces G0 / G1 synchronization ( Figures 5A , B ) and G0 / G1 synchronization has opposite effects for the two viruses ( Figure 5 )	1

6567	Proteasomal degradation of @GENE$ is preceded by its ubiquitination , which occurs by the association of @GENE$ with the @GENE$ [ 14 ]	1
6568	In order to check whether @GENE$ inhibits @GENE$ ubiquitination , we checked the level of ubiquitinated @GENE$ in ORF2 expressing cells	1
6569	Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG - 132 for 2 hours , @GENE$ was immunoprecipitated , followed by immunblotting with @GENE$	1
6570	Protein level of @GENE$ was significantly decreased in full - length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A top panel , lane 1 and 2 )	1
6571	A similar effect ( lane 3 ) was observed following expression of a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) with @GENE$ deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm [ 15 ]	1
6572	Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with @GENE$ to confirm its presence ( Figure 3A , middle panel )	1
6573	A parallel set of samples were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix , immunoprecipitated with @GENE$ and autoradiographed to check the expression of full - length and @GENE$ ( Figure 3A , bottom panel ) .	1
6574	Consecutive patients admitted with signs and symptoms consistent with @DISEASE$ were eligible for the study ( Table 1 )	1

6603	To further determine the effects of @GENE$ on CSFV replication , recombinant lentiviruses expressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) against @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were generated and transduced into PK - 15 cells , resulting in efficient knockdown of the @GENE$ expression ( Figure 4A )	1

6607	In comparison with the @GENE$ control , the @GENE$ copies in the @GENE$ - knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A )	1
6608	Similarly , the CSFV titers were significantly increased after @GENE$ knockdown in PK - 15 cells ( Figure 4B ) , and the @GENE$ expression in the sheEF1A - transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C )	1
6609	The results indicate that the @GENE$ negatively modulates the CSFV replication .	1

6614	@DISEASE$ is a common cause of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ worldwide ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 )	1
6615	Currently , there are two main methods for detecting an @DISEASE$ infection : one detects viral RNA b@GENE$  ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) and the other detects HCV antibod@GENE$ say [ enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ] in serum ( 9 , 10 )	1

6617	It can be used as a confirmation test	1
6618	However , its usage is limited in the clinical setting as the procedure requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and there is a high probability of contamination	1
6619	Therefore , the purpose of our study was to develop an affordable and reliable rapid lateral flow test to detect the presence of @DISEASE$ a@GENE$ ood samples by screening for HCV a@GENE$ ch would help decrease the chances of @DISEASE$ infection from blood transfusions .	1
6620	The partial @GENE$ sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM377987 - KM378038 and KM877524 - KM877547	1
6621	A total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparisons with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank ( S1 Table )	1
6622	These were aligned and manually adjusted using Clustal X2 and BioEdit	1

6626	In cell lysis assays , pathogenesis was eliminated by clearing the serum through anti - IgG and anti - IgM sepharose columns supportive of no role of per@GENE$ i - IgA responses	1
6627	This does not eliminate the potential role of intra -@GENE$ sue IgA + plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated [ 83 , 102 ]	1

6630	The case report @GENE$ dy success was proposed by the authors to be due to the downregulation of such an anti - endothelial invasive effect [ 63 ]	1
6631	Although intriguing , it remains unknown if these anti - endothelial responses actually contribute to the @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$ [ 123 ] .	1

6645	Three sets of @GENE$ were used to amplify the entire @GENE$ ( 1931 bp ) as described previously , with minor modifications ( Table 1 ) [ 12 ]	1
6646	An initial denaturation step at 94 • C for 1 min , followed by 35 - 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 30 s , annealing at 50 or 55 • C for 30 s and extension at 72 • C for 30 s , ending with a final extension at 72 • C for 1 min , was used for DNA amplification	1
6647	The @GENE$ were separated by electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) in 1 × tris - acetate EDTA and visualized using @GENE$ ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA )	1

6649	@GENE$ , synthesized in the liver , is an @GENE$ that is rapidly identified in the plasma in cases of infection or tissue damage	1
6650	@GENE$ is able to activate complement and enhance phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and injured , necrotic and apoptotic cells	1
6651	Therefore , @GENE$ is important in natural immunity ( 12 , 13 )	1
6652	Originally , @GENE$ was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation ; however , following ~ 10 years of investigation , it has been demonstrated that @GENE$ participates in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor ( 14 )	1
6653	In this study , it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were @GENE$ eased in the patients with @DISEASE$ and markedly increased in the patients with @DISEASE$	1
6654	Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin β chain varian@GENE$ e , which has been implicated in in @DISEASE$ ( 15 ) , although not in @DISEASE$ .	1
6655	In this report , we describe the findings of FOB + BAL , in a selected group of young persistent @DISEASE$ without underlying structural anomalies	1
6656	We focus on the microbiological findings and discuss the possible pathophysiology of @DISEASE$ .	1

6658	Nevertheless , the immunogenicity of @GENE$ requires further characterization in preclinical models for @DISEASE$	1
6659	In addition to the induction of MERS - CoV @GENE$ - CoV @GENE$ se to efficiently activate virus - specific CD8 + T cell responses	1
6660	For more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these T cell specificities in MERS - CoV - associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the N peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate MHC - restr@GENE$ d antigen presentation and the activation of virus - specific T cells	1
6661	In this study , we identified a new H2 - d rest@GENE$  - CoV N protein u@GENE$  D matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15 - mer N peptides	1
6662	First , we have identified two MERS - CoV N derived peptides ( N 353 - 367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK and N 357 - 371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP ) and further mapped these 15 - mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of N 358 - 367 = YKTFPKKEKK representing a decamer pep@GENE$  ) [ 64 ]	1
6663	Analysis of MERS - CoV sequences reveals that N 358 - 367@GENE$ d among different strains of MERS - CoV ( Table S2 ) [ 65 ]	1
6664	The availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a MVA based candidate vaccine against MERS - CoV in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models	1
6665	Of note , the H2 - d rest@GENE$ racterization of T cell responses in BALB / c mice that serve as a well - established @DISEASE$ infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hDPP4 [ 24 ,@GENE$ 41 , 43 , 44 ]	1
6666	A particular feature of @DISEASE$ in humans , as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals , is the lack of detectable MERS - @GENE$ ents with confirmed disease [ 66 , 67 ]	1
6667	This observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response , as already described for SARS - CoV [ 68 , 69 ]	1
6668	Thus , future use of a T cell - specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of MERS pathogenesis	1
6669	Here , studies on the function of MERS - CoV - specific CD8 + T cells in this BALB / c mouse MERS - CoV lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in MERS - CoV infection .	1
6670	Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul ( IRB No	1
6671	C - 1512 - 049 - 727 ) .	1
6672	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known op@GENE$ OR@GENE$ [ 6 ]	1
6673	OR@GENE$ des for no@GENE$ essential for viral replication ; OR@GENE$ des for the ma@GENE$  HEV , called OR@GENE$ and OR@GENE$ des for a ph@GENE$ ich may play a key role in manipulating various host - cell processes during viral infection , and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus [ 7 , 8 ]	1
6674	Although @DISEASE$ infection is generally self - limiting , it induces @DISEASE$ , which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women	1
6675	A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF - κB acti@GENE$ suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of @DISEASE$ patients [ 9 ]	1
6676	However , the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown .	1
6677	Frameshift reporter plasmids were linearized with @GENE$ and @GENE$ generated using @GENE$ as described ( 31 )	1
6678	@GENE$ were translated in nuclease - treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( RRL ) or wheat germ ( WG ) extracts ( Promega ) programmed with [UNK] 50 g / ml @GENE$	1
6679	Typical reactions were of 10 l volume and composed of 90 % ( v / v ) RRL , 20 M amino acids ( lacking methionine ) and 0	1
6680	2 MBq [ 35 S ] - methionine	1
6681	Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 • C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 10mM EDTA , 100 g / ml @GENE$ followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min	1
6682	Samples were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) by the addition of 10 volumes of 2 × Laemmli ' s sample buffer , boiled for 4 min and resolved by SDS - PAGE	1
6683	Dried gels were exposed to a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Screen ( PerkinElmer ) , the screen scanned using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager ( GE Healthcare ) in storage phosphor autoradiography mode and bands were quantified using ImageQuant TM TL software ( GE Healthcare )	1
6684	The calculations of frameshifting efficiency ( % FS ) took into account the differential methionine content of the various products and % FS was calculated as % − 1FS	1
6685	In contrast to the protection of @GENE$ against the infection of EV71 in hSCARB3 - transgenic mice , administration of the same amount of antibody did not protect hSCARB3 - transgenic mice from lethal @DISEASE$ infection	1
6686	Investigation of the affinity@GENE$  N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity	1
6687	We have identified t@GENE$  N3 specifically recognize@GENE$ op@GENE$ cid@GENE$ ion or na@GENE$ ues@GENE$ ome ; [ 17 ] )	1
6688	In comparison of the recent study [ 37 ] , alignment of the hig@GENE$ ion@GENE$ ces from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71 , which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross - neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence	1
6689	@GENE$ ope recognized@GENE$  N3 is also different from the previous report @GENE$ pes ; the mouse anti - sera generated from the peptides , P230 - 323 , P646 - 755 , P857 - 1012 and P1329 - 1440 , showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medull@GENE$  N3 only closely met with the peptide P746 - 876 which elicits weak cross - reactivity to human tissues [ 38 ] .	1
6690	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator to investigate cell viability using a neutral red assay	1
6691	The concentration of each protein was adjusted to be 1	1
6692	5625610 23 [ 19 ]	1
6693	However , when we introduced the same unit amounts of @GENE$ and @GENE$ into HeLa cells using a microporator , the antiviral effects of the @GENE$ were almost 8 - fold higher than those of @GENE$ ( Figure S2C )	1
6694	This result indicates that @GENE$ has a greater antiviral effect than @GENE$ , most likely due to the additional @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ ( Figure S2 ) .	1
6695	Virus - infected HeLa cells and SCH07072 cells were lysed using Pro - prep ( Intron , Daejeon , Korea )	1
6696	Cell lysates were analyzed by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi - dry method , incubated with @GENE$ ( 1 : 500 dilution for cleaved @GENE$ and @GENE$ and a 1 : 1000 dilution for @GENE$ and HSV ) for 12 hr at 4uC , and then incubated with @GENE$ ( 1 : 1000 ) for 1 hr at 37uC .	1
6697	Finally , survey participants were asked to indicate , by way of forced choice , their response to this statement : " Breaking or not obeying a quarantine order is most like which of the following [ choose 1 only ] : ( a ) parking in a no - parking zone ; ( b ) driving way above the speed limit on a busy street ; or ( c ) @DISEASE$	1
6698	" Fully 59 % responded that breaking quarantine is most like ' @DISEASE$ , ' whereas 27 % selected ' driving above the speed limit ' and 8 % chose ' parking in a no - parking zone ' ( 6 % did not answer ) .	1
6699	informed by the values , preferences , and practices of the affected communities	1
6700	The present findings indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine in the context of an @DISEASE$ outbreak and for serious sanctions against those who fail to comply	1
6701	Our data further suggest , however , that public support for quarantine is contingent on the implementation both of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and of psychosocial supports to provide for individuals who are adversely affected	1
6702	This tension between individual rights and the greater public good is precisely the challenge that @DISEASE$ presents to public health ethics	1
6703	In order to engender strong public support for the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures , government officials and public health policy - makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards , to educate and inform frontline public health workers , and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during @DISEASE$ outbreaks .	1

6706	In the Singapore setting , many participants highlighted the leading role of the MOH in regulating the health sector , but acknowledged challenges in regulating the private and animal health sector	1
6707	These challenges present examples where governance structures will need to weigh up the balance between regulation and persuasion as policy approaches	1
6708	In the Singaporean context , differential policies in the public and private human healthcare sectors , whether by design or practice , are likely to be counterproductive , as patients use both sectors and the occurrence of resistant infections in one sector has implications for the other	1
6709	On the other hand , the agricultural sector in Singapore is small and the availability of adequate veterinary expertise limited ; imposing tight regulations on antibiotic access in the absence of qualified prescribers is therefore challenging , and persuasive strategies to reduce antibiotic use in this sector are likely to be more realistic , at least in the short term	1
6710	On their collaborative approach towards governance , many participants highlighted the One Health platform as a good way of bringing stakeholders together	1
6711	The good relationship between researchers and policymakers was also emphasized via the many avenues for researchers to discuss and share their research findings and discuss policy implications with policymakers	1
6712	However , there were also conflicts reported specifically between human and animal health experts	1
6713	This was crystalized on their different takes on what contributes more to @DISEASE$	1
6714	Most physicians believed that antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters might be a more significant driver of @DISEASE$ , as has been explained by studies [ 28 ]	1
6715	In contrast , animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance when compared to @DISEASE$ infection rates in the health sector	1
6716	Finally , governing @DISEASE$ through the engagement of citizens and civil society was not reported as a strategy in Singapore	1
6717	However , this is not unique to Singapore , as it is well recognized that globally there has been a lack of engagement of civil society organizations in addressing @DISEASE$ , especially when comparing and contrasting to the high HIV involvement in the early 90s .	1
6718	The process of designing and implementing @DISEASE$ policies is complicated even in a country such as Singapore , which has dedicated funding and has developed a multisectoral approach to address @DISEASE$	1
6719	This paper has highlighted the increasing need to address the social , political , cultural , and behavioral aspects influencing @DISEASE$ rather than just focusing on the technical solutions	1
6720	Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response , it will be difficult to design policy interventions that produce the desired results and that cater for the needs of individuals , families , and the community as a whole .	1
6721	One method usually used for the determination of chelating activity uses ferrozine , which can quantitatively from complexes with Fe 2 +	1
6722	In the presence of other chelating agents , the complex formation is disrupted , giving rise to a decrease of the red colour of the complex ferrozine - Fe 2 +	1
6723	Measurement of the rate of colour reduction therefore allows estimation of the chelating activity of the coexisting chelator [ 46 ]	1
6724	Essential oils of Myrtus communis , Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus generally did not present chelating activity [ 46 , 54 ]	1
6725	The sole exception was the essential oils of flowers of myrtle	1
6726	The authors [ 46 ] explained this activity to the presence of eugenol and methyl eugenol in its essential oil , whereas these two components only belong to a minor fraction of leaf and stem essential oils	1
6727	These dihydroxylated compounds would be necessary to form chelated Fe 2 +	1
6728	Leaf and stem oils had as main components 1 , 8 - cineole and terpinen - 4 - ol , monohydroxylated compounds that would be unable to chelate ferrous ions [ 46 ]	1
6729	Concerning the essential oils of spice plants used in a Mediterranean diet , all of them were able to chelate Fe 2 + and did so in a concentration - dependent manner [ 52 ]	1
6730	At all concentrations assayed Rosmarinus officinalis L	1
6731	and Salvia officinalis essential oils showed the highest values for chelating Fe 2 +	1
6732	All the oils studied were better chelators of Fe 2 + than ascorbic acid and BHT , used as references [ 52 ] .	1
6733	Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS IBM Statistics version 19 software	1
6734	Mann - Withney Test was used for equality of medians , with a 2 - tailed p - value < 0	1
6735	05 considered statistically significant	1
6736	Multiple comparisons were handled by the Holm ' s method .	1
6737	Recently , @DISEASE$ has been shown to be highly associated with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in children with persistent @DISEASE$ [ 22 ]	1
6738	Nevertheless , it remains unclear whether @DISEASE$ infection is simply a consequence of impaired mucociliary clearance or whether it is an independent inflammatory stimulus in persistent @DISEASE$ .	1
6739	We may obtain an estimate for R 0 by calculating the initial growth rate ( k ) of an infection from data and equating it to the growth rate of the equations , calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the disease - free equilibrium ( see Methods )	1
6740	Such an exercise reveals that for any observed k , the precise value of R 0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods	1
6741	Specifically , we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R 0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate , k :	1
6742	HeLa cells were transiently transfected with @GENE$ - [ 32 ]	1
6743	After overnight cultivation at 37 • C , released @GENE$ were harvested as described above and lysed in protease cleavage buffer ( 50 mM MES pH 6	1

6746	In vitro processing was performed using 2	1

6748	Processing was terminated by addition of SDS - PAGE sample buffer and boiling .	1
6749	Health education should be given to @DISEASE$ patients and their relatives for them to prevent the spread of infection and maintain good hygienic practices .	1
6750	One of our goals is to understand the degree to which our methods are robust with respect to partial information , that is , provide a reliable prediction even when limited information about the true pseudoknot - free structure , @GENE$ , is available	1
6751	For this purpose we generate subset structures of the corresponding @GENE$ , for each RNA sequence in the HK - PK and HK - PK - free data sets	1
6752	For each α , 0	1
6753	05 ≤ α ≤ 0	1

6758	, α = 0	1
6759	01 and α = 0	1
6760	99 )	1
6761	We repeat this step 100 times to generate 100 substructures of @GENE$ for each value of α for each RNA sequence in our data sets	1
6762	We then run our methods on all 100 substructures for each RNA sequence in our data sets and α value and calculate the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average F - measure of these 100 cases as the accuracy interval for each method and each RNA sequence and α value in our data set	1
6763	We also compare our methods when the true pseudoknot - free structure , @GENE$ is provided .	1
6764	We run IPknot using the provided source code and the default parameters for scoring model and level ( i	1
6765	e	1
6766	, scoring model = McCaskill and level = 2 )	1
6767	The default values provided for base pair weights are not the same on the IPknot website ( i	1

6774	We run @GENE$ with all of these values with and without refinement and provide @GENE$ ' s bootstrap 95 % confidence intervals for average F - measures for all of our data sets as a table in the Additional file 2	1
6775	Based on its performance we present @GENE$ ' s results with default settings ( i	1

6781	The information from this study may not only help to understand the evolution of the @DISEASE$ , especially for DVPVs genotype 1 , but also have potential value for the development of @DISEASE$ vaccines .	1
6782	To develop software to batch - process and calculate CBF , we focused on two core components : the first was to extract the pixel intensities of particular region of interest ( ROI ) over time and the second to use this data for fast Fourier transformation ( FFT )	1
6783	We used the freely available open - source ImageJ software to determine the average pixel intensity of up to 40 × 40 ROI per frame of the AVI file [ 20 ]	1
6784	The @GENE$ exports a dataset of up to 1 , 600 ROI to Excel 2007 ( Microsoft ; Redmond , WA , USA ) where a visual basic macro is initiated to perform the FFT	1
6785	The complex number is translated using the Excel function ' = IMABS ( range ) ' and the dominant frequency within the range is then established using the function ' = MAX ( range ) '	1
6786	The CBF is determined by multiplying the row number by the frequency resolution ( FR ) ( frame rate of recording / number of frames ) , which we named the ' @GENE$ '	1
6787	In order to more accurately predict the CBF , we averaged the sum of the @GENE$ of the peaks flanking the maximum ( see Figure 1B ) .	1

6803	If Adv infection can be diagnosed early , increased monitoring and early applied organ support may improve the clinical outcome of these patients	1
6804	However , sufficient data on the distinctive characteristics of @DISEASE$ in immunocompetent patients is currently unavailable	1
6805	We previously observed that @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) patients have a high @DISEASE$ and respond differently to antipyretic treatment compared to @DISEASE$ patients who test positive for other viruses or bacteria	1
6806	Therefore , the primary goal of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of Adv - and Non - Adv - positive @DISEASE$ patients among immunocompetent military personnel and to identify the distinctive characteristics .	1
6807	@DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ with a heterogeneous pathogenesis and variable timing and clinical presentations	1
6808	Therefore , one specific therapy is unlikely to improve outcomes	1
6809	Rather than excluding single therapeutic options , identifying patients ' risk factors and the individual @DISEASE$ stage may be more important for successful outcomes	1
6810	We report here in our retrospective analysis that intravenous IgM@GENE$ inistration in the initial stages of severe @DISEASE$ did not improve overall outcomes or the severity of disease .	1
6811	Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is released from cell membranes by @GENE$ under the stimulus of several factors associated with @DISEASE$	1

6815	Nitric oxide ( NO ) , prostaglandins and @GENE$ participate in inflammatory events	1
6816	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) catalise the formation of NO and prostaglandins , respectively	1

6818	Long considered an anachronism from a bygone era , quarantine has re - emerged in the 21 st century as an important ( albeit controversial ) tool in the battle against @DISEASE$	1
6819	Prior to the 2003 outbreak of severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , it had been more than 50 years since mass quarantine measures had been invoked in North America [ 1 ]	1
6820	The @DISEASE$ containment measures imposed in Canada and Asia , and on a lesser scale in the U	1
6821	S	1
6822	, provoked a heated debate within the public health community regarding the ethics and legality of quarantine [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] .	1
6823	The network analysis of the @GENE$ was performed by the " Analyze Network Algorithm " provided by Metacore TM software	1
6824	The pathway analysis of the @GENE$ was performed using the GeneGo pathway maps in the Metacore TM database ( version 6	1
6825	24 ; build 67895 , Thomson Reuters )	1
6826	In addition , the Pathway Maps tool was used for pathway enrichment evaluation , in which the p - values were calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution with the default background database .	1
6827	In 2016 , our Pediatric ED registered 23197 visits , 603 ( 2	1
6828	6 % ) of whom for " @DISEASE$ , " " @DISEASE$ , " or " @DISEASE$ "	1
6829	Of the 603 patients , 491 ( 81 % ) were discharged , while 112 children ( 19 % ) were admitted , 15 % ( = 89 ) to a short - stay observation ( up to 36 hours ) and 4 % ( = 23 ) to our Pediatric Unit Ward ; 1 child was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit after initial treatment in the Pediatric Ward .	1
6830	Good infection control and prevention in the healthcare settings reduce the risk of contracting @DISEASE$	1
6831	@DISEASE$ settings should have the following @DISEASE$ infection control and prevention measures : workplace and administrative control measures , environmental control measures , and personal control measures	1
6832	People who work or receive care in healthcare settings are at higher risk of being infected by @DISEASE$	1
6833	Therefore , it is necessary to have a @DISEASE$ infection control plan	1
6834	Healthcare facilities should design policies and procedures for @DISEASE$ control	1
6835	It should be reviewed periodically and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of @DISEASE$ .	1
6836	Several @GENE$ have been implicated in modulation of the host cell ' s antiviral defenses ( Table 2 )	1
6837	The @GENE$ of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and SEOV possess an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in the @GENE$ that binds to @GENE$ , and the ITAM may also interact with @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ found in lymphocytes [ 58 , 59 ] , although there is no evidence that lymphocytes are susceptible to @DISEASE$	1
6838	The ITAM may also promote polyubiquitination of the Gn polypeptide to facilitate its degradation [ 60 ] ; however , it is unclear how it impacts the host response to infection	1
6839	Presumably , the ITA@GENE$ erferes with the antiviral response of an infected cell since the motif is cytoplasmic	1
6840	The Gn @GENE$  also alter the RIG@GENE$ hway that leads to IRF@GENE$ sphorylation and subsequent Ifn@GENE$ ression [ 61 ]	1
6841	The nuc@GENE$  also antagonize the expression of Ifn@GENE$ binding to imp@GENE$  interfering with NF @GENE$ lear transport , which is required for Ifn@GENE$ ression [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ]	1
6842	Additionally , both cas@GENE$  gra@GENE$  targets of the nuc@GENE$ some hantaviruses [ 65 ] and both are essential components of CTL - mediated apoptosis	1
6843	The lack of damage to the endothelium of infected rodent reservoirs suggests this may be an important mechanism of preventing viral clearance	1
6844	The nuc@GENE$ ANDV , but not other hantaviruses , also inhibits autophosphorylation and activation of TBK@GENE$ n enzyme that activates IRF@GENE$  NF @GENE$  induction of typ@GENE$ ression [ 66 ] .	1
6845	Targeting polyamines as an antiviral strategy shows significant promise , and the availability of FDA - approved molecules like DFMO underscores the potential of inhibiting this pathway for limiting @DISEASE$ infection	1
6846	We previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ]	1
6847	Here , we show that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO - mediated polyamine depletion via two distinct and independent mutations	1
6848	Such emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication	1
6849	As viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals , potential therapy that includes polyamine depletion would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance	1
6850	Neither protease mutant exhibited an enhanced fitness phenotype , as we had observed with CHIKV mutants [ 31 ] , suggesting that even if this virus were to emerge , the mutation may not fix in a viral population not exposed to DFMO .	1
6851	Initial antibiotic agents were intravenously administered to all of the patients	1
6852	Initial antibiotic regimens were followed by adherence to the " Treatment Guidelines for @DISEASE$ in Korea : An Evidence - based Approach to Appropriate Antimicrobial Therapy " from The Korean Academy of @DISEASE$ [ 21 ]	1
6853	The antipyretic agents and regimens used in this study were as follows	1
6854	Propacetamol was intravenously administered at a dose of 1 to 2 g as needed to a maximum of 8 g per day	1
6855	Acetaminophen was given orally at a dose of 2 tablets ( 650 mg per tablet ) every 8 h to a maximum of 6 tablets per day	1
6856	Physical cooling methods applied to all febrile patients included external air , ice bag , or water blanket techniques .	1
6857	MMF and MPA	1
6858	Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) belongs to the class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive agents	1
6859	Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , the active metabolite of MMF , is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
6860	In addition to its potent immunosuppressive capacity , the in vitro assay has indicated that MPA has antiviral effect against HCV [ 45 ]	1
6861	In @DISEASE$ cell culture models , MPA could induce the expression of impo@GENE$ genes , incl@GENE$ F @GENE$ IRF 9 @GENE$ ei@GENE$ FITM3 ) [ 46 ]	1
6862	Among these proteins , data showed@GENE$  IRF1 was directly involved in the anti - HCV activity of MPA	1
6863	Moreover , MPA could have effects in synergy@GENE$ h IFN - on HCV replication in the same @DISEASE$ experiments	1
6864	In addition , when co@GENE$ ed with IFN - , MPA augmented the trans@GENE$ lated genes	1
6865	With the molecular basis of how MPA works in s@GENE$ gy with IFN , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against @DISEASE$ in vivo	1
6866	On the other hand , although the safety and efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressive medication in @DISEASE$ patients undergoing @DISEASE$ have been demonstrated , the exact effects on @DISEASE$ recurrence have not been clearly studied .	1
6867	Highly localized signature of positive selection in PARP4 @GENE$ , also known as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a @GENE$ that is a component of widely conserved , large @GENE$ structures known as ' ' vaults ' '	1
6868	Vaults are barrel - shaped particles composed of three proteins , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , as well as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 44 ]	1
6869	The function of @GENE$ is unknown , but they have been implicated in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and immunity	1
6870	In support of a role in immunity , MVP@GENE$ he core structural component of the	1
6871	10 mDa mass of vau@GENE$ s upregulated by IFN@GENE$ nd vaults are most highly expressed in immune cell types such as dendritic cells and macrophages [ 45 ] .	1
6872	Two different types of communication can be differentiated : explicit and implicit	1
6873	They distinguish between the workload distribution by a parallel component to multiple compute nodes and the communication between two of more servers exchanging data , respectively	1
6874	Serverserver communication uses raw sockets to transfer data from one machine to the other	1
6875	This solution provides a performance benefit over more sophisticated alternatives such as RMI or CORBA , but represents the lowest level of abstraction of the underlying network	1
6876	As an answer to this trade - off , @GENE$ overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number of network level operations	1
6877	Thus , a developer has a high degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I / O scheme provided by the communication layer	1
6878	Implicit communication refers to the communication that takes place between the output of one component and the input of another component , i	1
6879	e	1
6880	the selected data paths among components	1
6881	The underlying transfer mechanism is provided by the middleware and comprises input buffers in order to enable asynchronous communication .	1
6882	Etiology and transmission 1	1
6883	What species of @DISEASE$ infect cats ? What is their geographical distribution ?	1
6884	In conclusion , we have provided evidence that maternal H 2 administration reduced deficits in short - term memory and social interaction in the LPS - induced MIA model , and also demonstrated an attenuation of the LPS - induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic cell loss	1
6885	Remarkably , the neuroprotective effect of H 2 appeared in the amygdala and cortex in this mouse model	1
6886	The neuroprotection is thought to be due to the suppression of neuroinflammation , including excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes and the increased level of @GENE$ , as reported previously 12	1
6887	Although further investigation is required , our current and previous results point to the potential efficacy of maternal H 2 administration on the long - term neurological outcomes of offspring exposed to inflammation in utero .	1
6888	Interestingly , amastigotes were also found associated with neoplastic tissue in the lesion of two cats with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 13 ]	1
6889	In one other case , @DISEASE$ was diagnosed in a cat presenting concurrent @DISEASE$ [ 14 , 59 ] .	1
6890	Demographic characteristics , underlying diseases , medical history , clinical examination at enrollment , radiological findings , vaccinations , and outcome were recorded prospectively for each patient on a standardized form .	1
6891	Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists , both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures	1
6892	Here , we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important , yet largely ignored , assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models .	1
6893	Two - tailed chi - square test ( two by two table ) was performed using http : / / www	1
6894	openepi	1
6895	com / website to calculate the prevalence of the identified pathogens and coinfection frequencies in different age groups	1
6896	The relative risk ratio ( RR ) and odds ratio ( OR ) were estimated at 95 % confidence interval ( CI )	1
6897	Fisher ' s exact test using GraphPad Prism 5	1
6898	0 was done for comparison of pathogen frequencies between symptomatic and asymptomatic children as some of the values were less than five	1
6899	A p - value of less than 0	1
6900	05 was considered significant .	1
6901	@GENE$ are involved in protein - protein interactions that mediate diverse cellular processes	1
6902	@GENE$ consist of @GENE$ ending in a @GENE$	1
6903	The @GENE$ form a funnel - shaped , β - propeller structure made up of 6 - 8 blades , with each blade consisting of four anti - parallel β - sheets that are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds	1
6904	This rigid @GENE$ provides multiple stable surfaces for protein interactions ( Pashkova et al	1
6905	, 2010 ; Stirnimann et al	1
6906	, 2010 ; Villamil et al	1
6907	, 2013 ) .	1
6908	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) are a family of highly related proteins composed of 5 members in humans ( @GENE$ ) [ 1 , 2 ]	1
6909	Of these , @GENE$ have emerged as broadacting @GENE$ capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( @DISEASE$ 1 ) [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]	1
6910	To stress the importance that IFITMs pl@GENE$ he control of @DISEASE$ , IFITM3 knockout@GENE$ isplay increased mortality and viral burden following @DISEASE$ challenge [ 8 , 13 ] and a specific polymorphism in the IFITM3 allele has been @GENE$ ted to increased susceptibility to @DISEASE$ in humans [ 13 , 14 ] .	1
6911	In contrast , ADP - ribosylation is still poorly characterized for its role in innate immunity , despite being one of the first identified @GENE$	1
6912	Transfer of ADP - ribose ( ADPr ) from NAD + ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) to proteins is catalyzed within eukaryotic cells by members of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 5 ]	1
6913	The best - studied @GENE$ , including the founding member @GENE$ , catalyze the formation of long , branched chains of ADP - ribose known as poly - ADP - ribose ( @GENE$ ) [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]	1
6914	These @GENE$ perform critical housekeeping functions , such as nucleation of DNA - damage foci ( @GENE$ ) and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis ( @GENE$ ) [ 7 , 8 ]	1
6915	In contrast to these well - described functions , most @GENE$ are poorly understood , in part due to their lack of conservation in model organisms such as C	1
6916	elegans and D	1
6917	melanogaster [ 4 , 9 , 10 ]	1
6918	In total , 17 genes in the @GENE$ contain @GENE$ , with each gene containing a variety of other functional domains that likely endow each @GENE$ with their individual functions ( Figure 1A ) [ 4 , 10 ]	1
6919	Many of the poorly - characterized @GENE$ are found in the cytoplasm [ 11 ] and are predicted to only catalyze addition of a single ADPr , rather than @GENE$ , to proteins [ 4 , 9 , 10 ]	1
6920	Several recent descriptions of @GENE$ functions in cellular signaling , miRNA regulation and stress granule formation [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] suggest that many functions for cytoplasmic ADP - ribosylation , especially mono - ADP - ribosylation , likely remain uncharacterized	1
6921	Moreover , the discovery that a subset of @GENE$ can , in addition to binding @GENE$ , also remove mono - ADP - ribose from proteins [ 15 , 16 ] , sheds further light on the regulation and function of this dynamic @GENE$ .	1
6922	These challenges emphasize the importance of chemotherapy to treat these @DISEASE$ [ 5 ]	1
6923	There are around 40 antiviral compounds in clinical use targeting various @DISEASE$ ( over half of these drugs are being used in the treatment of patients with @DISEASE$ ) while there is no treatment for most acute infections , such as the ones that cause severe illnesses , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and even @DISEASE$ [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
6924	Most of the available drugs are of limited efficacy and come with severe side effects [ 6 ]	1
6925	Importantly , antiviral chemotherapy is plagued by the rapid development of drug resistance strains , resulting from the high rate of replication of viruses combined with the low fidelity with which they replicate their genomes [ 10 ] .	1
6926	IFA slides were coated with MERS - CoV non - infected or infected Vero cells	1
6927	Serum samples were diluted in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to 1 : 10 , 1 : 100 , 1 : 250 , and 1 : 1 , 000 , transferred to @GENE$ slides , and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ° C in a humidified chamber	1
6928	The @GENE$ were washed 3 times in PBS - T for 5 minutes transmission [ 7 , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] , followed by intra - familial transmission .	1
6929	The characteristics of the 47 patients are shown in Table 1	1
6930	Thirty - two patients ( 68	1
6931	1 % ) were men and the mean age was 62	1
6932	1 years	1
6933	@DISEASE$ was the most common underlying disease ( 29	1
6934	8 % ) , followed by @DISEASE$ ( 19	1
6935	0 % ) , and @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ ( both 12	1

6937	Sixteen patients ( 34	1

6939	2 % ) had @DISEASE$ , and 6 ( 12	1
6940	8 % ) had @DISEASE$	1
6941	Most baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ groups	1
6942	By contrast , mean APACHE II ( 27	1

6954	001 ) scores were significantly higher in the @DISEASE$ group than in the @DISEASE$ group	1
6955	However , mortality rates , including 28 - day mortality , did not significantly differ between the groups .	1
6956	The host cell detects invading pathogens through @GENE$ , which recognize foreign molecular patterns that are generated during infection	1
6957	The particular @GENE$ involved in the recognition of the pathogen depends on the infecting virus [ 108 ]	1
6958	In @DISEASE$ infection , the most important P@GENE$ re T@GENE$  T@GENE$  T@GENE$  r@GENE$  R@GENE$  , and @@GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
6959	@GENE$ recognizes @GENE$ , which is formed as an intermediate during @DISEASE$ replication [ 113 , 114 ]	1
6960	T@GENE$  which are located in the endosomes , recognize s@GENE$  such as the g@GENE$ f flaviviruses [ 95 , [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ]	1

6962	In order to establish an infection , a pathogen needs to overcome or evade the innate immune response	1
6963	To breach the very first line of defense , the skin - TBFVs use the tick to deliver the virus through the skin via tick saliva	1
6964	Furthermore , tick saliva contains immunomodulatory compounds that enhance viral transmission and dissemination [ 175 , 176 ]	1
6965	Although there are several mechanisms in which mosquito - borne flaviviruses actively suppress the induction of @GENE$ , no such mechanism has been identified in @DISEASE$ so far [ 177 ]	1
6966	Instead , TBEV , like other @DISEASE$ , utilizes a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes , and thus delaying the recognition by the cytosolic RIG - I l@GENE$  phosphorylatio@GENE$  IFN induction ( Fig@GENE$ 4A ) [ 80 , 81 , 83 ] .	1
6967	We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1 outbreak of 2009 - 2010 , using strain California / 04 / 2009 as a reference	1
6968	This was the first sequenced genome of the outbreak included in Kedwaii , et al	1
6969	[ 8 ]	1
6970	We then calculated the extent of mutational divergence of all subsequent @GENE$ over the duration of the outbreak .	1
6971	Lung microbiome studies suggest that bacteria colonizing the LRT overlap with those found in the URT , but that the abundance of organisms is quite low [ 13 ] , and their role in @DISEASE$ etiology has yet to be explored	1
6972	To colonize the @GENE$ , an organism must overcome mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis by resident alveolar macrophages , neutrophils and monocyte - derived macrophages [ 37 , 38 ] , but many URT pathogens have developed strategies to overcome these barriers	1
6973	H	1
6974	influenzae , @DISEASE$ and Bordetella pertussis resist mucociliary clearance by impairing ciliary function .	1
6975	Samples from the gastrointestinal tract showed the greatest RQ and the highest proportion of viral presence in infected individuals with rectal swabs showing the highest recovery of @GENE$ ( RQ mean = 81	1
6976	09 ± 99	1

6983	Out of all other tissues , the liver showed a proportionately high intensity of infection ( RQ mean = 7	1
6984	04 ± 5	1
6985	97 CI , n = 11 )	1
6986	Interestingly , lice showed both a high ratio of SADV to squirrel DNA ( RQ mean = 78	1
6987	24 ± 152	1
6988	23 CI , n = 5 ) and where present on an infected squirrel the prevalence of @DISEASE$ in lice was high ( 0	1
6989	8 ( 4 / 5 ) , 0	1
6990	30 - 0	1
6991	99 CI ) .	1
6992	All sample types investigated contained adequate amounts of @GENE$ for amplification of the IC , with even those samples with expected low yields of @GENE$ ( cutaneous swabs , especially those from the arm area ) amplifying the IC ( see absolute quantification results , Online Resource S10 , Fig	1
6993	S10	1
6994	1 ) .	1
6995	Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome of CaKoVs showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with Aichivirus A	1
6996	The cluster Aichivirus A contains Kobuviruses from dogs , cats , rodents , bats and human	1
6997	While Aichivirus B and C contain Kobuviruses from cattle and pigs , respectively	1
6998	Based on whole genome sequence , Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania ( Fig	1
6999	3 )	1
7000	Phylogenetic analysis of 3D and @GENE$ of Thai CaKoVs and reference CaKoVs from various animal species were also performed	1
7001	Similarly , @GENE$ of Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs ( G1 sub - cluster ) but separated from the viruses in sub - clusters G2 as well as G3 ( Fig	1
7002	4 )	1
7003	Phylogenetic analysis of @GENE$ , the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups , US / EU / Africa subgroup and China / Thailand subgroup ( Fig	1
7004	5 ) .	1
7005	In our study , we could not find evidence of @DISEASE$ in the public health providers after direct contact with confirmed patients	1
7006	This may be because there was a lower risk of transmission when participants optimal use of PPE to prevent @DISEASE$	1
7007	8 Moreover , since the participants did not contact any spreaders except one participant who contacted a patient that caused two secondary infections , the risk of transmission from the contacted patients was likely low .	1
7008	The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols , significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin	1
7009	The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered	1
7010	The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers	1
7011	Conclusions : The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient	1
7012	The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks	1
7013	Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important	1
7014	For future studies , investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control .	1
7015	Most participants recounted low awareness of @DISEASE$ among Singaporeans	1
7016	Furthermore , @DISEASE$ was identified as a recently coined term and many professionals including physicians were not familiar with the term even though they were knowledgeable of the topic itself	1
7017	The next quote is an example of such reports : " I guess AMR , this phrase (	1
7018	.	1
7019	) if you were to tell me it ' s @DISEASE$ , I would not know it ' s antimicrobial resistance	1
7020	" - I01 , Human Health Participants also remarked there was low awareness of @DISEASE$ both as a topic as well a term among other One Health stakeholders including farmers and others within the environmental health sector	1
7021	When we contacted potential participants from the environment sector , very few agreed to be interviewed since many reported not having conducted sufficient work related to @DISEASE$	1
7022	The next quote highlights the concerns expressed by an environmental health expert who was worried about the lack of awareness among his colleagues at " the ground level " : " At the ground level , they were saying , " What is @DISEASE$ ? " People don ' t really know	1
7023	(	1
7024	.	1
7025	) How do we address it ? This is a difficult question	1
7026	" - I09 , Environment Health Awareness was also perceived to be low in the general population as expressed by participants	1
7027	Timely awareness efforts by the academic sector had not yet reached the general population	1
7028	Since 2016 , Singapore has been actively participating in the annual World Antibiotic Awareness Week every November , reaching out to the public at various public forums , hospitals and national libraries [ 22 , 23 ]	1
7029	In 2017 , the MOH and Health Promotion Board organized a social campaign focusing on the general prevention of infection to fight the spread of @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 24 ]	1
7030	This was closely followed by a " Use Antibiotics Right " campaign with the key message that antibiotics do not work on viruses [ 25 ]	1
7031	Despite these efforts many participants voiced the lack of civil society or social groups movements to support the agenda of @DISEASE$ in contrast to the high @DISEASE$ awareness in the early 90s	1
7032	The following quote highlights the need to further develop health promotion campaigns :	1
7033	We evaluated the ability of @GENE$ and a panel of @GENE$ with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH - dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV - 1 JRFL ; 50 % inhibitory concentrations ( IC 50 s ) of the @GENE$ ranged from 0	1
7034	06 to	1
7035	50 mg / ml ( Fig	1
7036	3E )	1
7037	Both @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and mAbs @GENE$ and @GENE$ ; Figure 3A ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6	1
7038	0	1
7039	At 50 mg / ml , transcytosis correlated directly with @GENE$ binding to HIV - 1 JRFL ( Spearman rho = 0	1
7040	75 ; p = 0	1
7041	052 ) and inversely with the IC 50 of the @GENE$ ( Spearman rho = 20	1
7042	71 ; p = 0	1
7043	050 ) ( Figure S5 )	1
7044	At pH 6	1
7045	0 , all @GENE$ and @GENE$ mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM - bl cells ( Figure 3C and D )	1
7046	However , there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity ( IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis ( Spearman ' s rho = 0	1
7047	86 ; p = 0	1
7048	001 )	1
7049	Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg / ml , was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non - @GENE$ - dependent manner ( i	1
7050	e	1
7051	, in the presence of @GENE$ ) ( Fig	1
7052	3C )	1
7053	Conversely , transcytosis mediated by @GENE$ with the lowest IC 50 s , such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ , resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the @GENE$ ( Figure 3D )	1
7054	Thus , strong binding activity results in more @GENE$ - dependent transcytosis , whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious .	1
7055	Our second data set is the @GENE$ data set of Sato et al	1
7056	[ 42 ]	1
7057	This set contains 168 @GENE$ from 16 categories of @GENE$	1
7058	The sequences in this set have at most 85 % similarity and have length of at most 140 nucleotides	1
7059	We refer to this data set as " IP - @GENE$ " .	1
7060	HFold - PKonly : Given an @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and a pseudoknot - free input structure , @GENE$ , find a pseudoknotfree structure , G such that every base pair in G crosses some base pair of G and such that G ∪ G is the lowest energy structure that contains G among all such G s	1
7061	Note that G may contain no @GENE$	1
7062	Iterative HFold also uses the SimFold RNA secondary structure prediction method [ 63 ] , which predicts the minimum free energy pseudoknot - free secondary structure for a given @GENE$	1
7063	@GENE$ uses a dynamic programming method similar to Zuker ' s MFold method [ 64 ]	1
7064	In this work we used the @GENE$ energy parameters when running @GENE$	1
7065	In addition to an @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ can also take a pseudoknot - free secondary structure , G , as input and predict the MFE @GENE$ secondary structure that contains all @GENE$ of G .	1
7066	The taxonomic lineage obtained from UniProt for all the reviewed @GENE$ correspond to the Baltimore classification system	1
7067	To do the conversion between the Baltimore and ICTV classification systems , we matched the organism name for each reviewed sequence from UniProt with the organism names obtained from the @GENE$ 2015 v1 , available at : https : / / talk	1

7070	On the other hand , despite extensive efforts in drug development targeting @GENE$ , a series of drug - resistant mutants from @DISEASE$ have been reported , such as the I223R / H275Y dual mutation of neuramin@GENE$ luenza A H1N1 , which shows enormous resistance towards oseltamivir ( approximately 7500 times that of the wild type ; van der Vries et al	1

7079	They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs	1
7080	Surprisingly , unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its @GENE$	1
7081	In vi vo antiviral activity of @GENE$ and its @GENE$ and @GENE$ conjugates needs to be assessed .	1
7082	Similar results were notably obtained when the supernatants of PBMCs derived from all cats were incubated with CrFK cells prior to their inoculation with all the above - mentioned viruses ( data not shown )	1
7083	This cell line has previously indicated less sensitivity to the antiviral effects of @GENE$ [ 66 ] and generally 10 - fold higher amounts of @GENE$ were found in titration experiments to be required for the inhibition of all five viruses	1
7084	Concordantly , average fold viral inhibition in CrFK cells by the @GENE$ 2216 was approximately half that observed in fcwf - 4 cells .	1
7085	The first pathway leads to initiation of rapidly progressing , destructive chain reactions , generating hydroperoxides and volatile compounds , generally through a three - phase process : initiation , propagation and termination .	1
7086	Bartonella are globally distributed bacteria that can cause @DISEASE$ in humans and domestic animals	1
7087	Bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria , but little is known about how prevalence varies over time , routes of transmission , and the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats	1
7088	We present results from a two - year , spatially replicated study of common vampire bats , which have previously shown high infection prevalence of Bartonella and could pose risks of cross - species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood	1
7089	We found that vampire bat Bartonella is genetically diverse , geographically widespread and endemic , and that individual - level infection risk is highest for large , male , non - reproductive bats	1
7090	Phylogenetic analysis supported vector - borne transmission , and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through PCR	1
7091	Confirming whether arthropod vectors are the main route of transmission for bat Bartonella is needed for understanding infection dynamics in bats and for predicting risks of cross - species transmission to humans and livestock .	1
7092	Another limitation is the small patient cohort	1
7093	Due to the multiple exclusion criteria applied , the patients included in the analysis represented only 1 , 2 % of children seen in our clinic because of persistent @DISEASE$	1
7094	Nevertheless , analysis of this highly selected population without structural causes of @DISEASE$ clearance , enabled us to evaluate the association between @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and symptoms resistant to ICS therapy .	1

7100	The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate	1
7101	Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals	1
7102	Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P [UNK] 0	1
7103	05 ) between samples challenged with the same @DISEASE$ strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama , respectively ) ; differences between distinct @DISEASE$ strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P [UNK] 0	1

7106	001 ) .	1
7107	To examine possible transmission of @DISEASE$ through biting , grooming , blood sharing , or fecal - oral exposure , we used metagenomic data from a parallel study to screen vampire bat saliva and fecal samples for B@GENE$  Three saliva and three fecal pools were shotgun sequenced , each containing nucleic acid extractions from swabs collected from ten vampire bats from one to two colonies	1
7108	Pooled samples contained individuals from the same colonies of bats tested for Bartonella in blood through PCR , though not necessarily the same individuals .	1
7109	To simulate a cough , aerosol injections were employed right at the mouth of the index patient	1
7110	According to experimental measurements of cough droplets , the quantity of the droplets smaller than 3 μm was quite small , and the droplets larger than 100 μm might fall down to the ground immediately after they were expelled [ 33 , 34 ]	1
7111	So in this work , the original size range of the aerosols was 3 μm ~ 112 μm and ten size classes were used to simulate the size distribution	1
7112	In enclosed environment , the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets [ 32 ]	1
7113	Considering that the equilibrium diameter after evaporation was 50 % of the original size [ 35 ] , the size range of the aerosol injections was 1	1
7114	5 ~ 56 μm and the size distribution followed the experimental results given by Duguid [ 34 ]	1
7115	The particles number of each size class was set as 50 , 000 and the total number of the particles of the ten size classes was 500 , 000 , follows the aerosol setup used by previous studies [ 18 , 22 ]	1
7116	The total volume of this computational geometry is larger than that of Reference [ 22 ] ( 30 m 3 ) and smaller than that of Reference [ 18 ] ( 97 m 3 ) , thus the total number of the particles used in this numerical simulation can be considered as enough for this study	1
7117	This number would be converted to the original number according to the size distribution of cough for infection risk assessment	1
7118	The size distribution of the droplets used in the numerical simulation is shown in Table 3	1
7119	The coughing direction was 45 degree downwards ( 0 , 1 , − 1 )	1
7120	When the index patient coughs , the open area of his mouth was 9	1
7121	68 cm 2	1
7122	The velocity of the exhaled airflow was set according to the experimental results to approximately simulate a cough [ 19 ] .	1
7123	The development of targeted agents for @DISEASE$ has been greatly hindered by two factors - the incomplete understandi@GENE$ f @DISEASE$ substrate specificity and , until recently , the paucity of high - resolution atomic structures	1
7124	Here , we have presented the most comprehensive examination of the substrate spe@GENE$ city of APN to date and detailed the key structural interactions that dictate this specificity	1
7125	By understanding the molecular arch@GENE$ ture of APN at the atomic level and investing its specificity with our global profiling technique , we were able to rationally design peptide inhibitors of its enzymatic act@GENE$ e S@GENE$ cket of APN has hydrophobic walls with an open end resulting from the presence of Met349 , Phe467 and Tyr472	1
7126	As predict@GENE$ from the S1 archite@GENE$ re , the P1 spe@GENE$ city of APN favored hydrophobic residues	1
7127	Amino acids with large positively charged side chains ( such as arginine and lysine ) are also tolerated as substrates because their side chains can form hydrophobic and polar interactions with aforementioned resi@GENE$ e S1 pocket	1
7128	In contrast , acidic residues ( glutamic acid and aspartic acid ) and short - branched residues ( such as asparagine and proline ) are strongly disfav@GENE$ d in the P1 position due to charge and VDW repulsion , respectively .	1
7129	We detected a viral pathogen from the nasopharynx in 40 % of the children with @DISEASE$ in this study , indicating that respiratory RNA viruses play an important role in this common @DISEASE$ in Nepal	1
7130	RSV was the most common agent isolated , and occurred with considerable temporal variation	1
7131	As for many other common childhood infections , such as @DISEASE$ , the occurrence of @DISEASE$ in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several @DISEASE$ , highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures in resource - poor settings	1
7132	Research and Education ( NUFU project number PRO 36 / 2002 )	1
7133	The sponsors of the study had no role in study design , data collection , data analysis , data interpretation , or writing of the report	1
7134	The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication .	1
7135	Evidence is deemed credible if it is scientifically rigorous , and the legitimacy and authority of its producer	1
7136	The credibility of the evidence used to guide some of the response decisions to @DISEASE$ was questionable	1
7137	Specific examples include the use of quarantine ( Holm 2009 ; Jacobs 2007 ; Tracy et al	1
7138	2009 ) and travel advisories ( Paquin 2007 ) both locally and globally .	1
7139	Real time PCR was performed to assess whether @GENE$ expression was modulated by PGE 2	1
7140	Total RNA was isolated using the RNA Bee kit ( Qiagen , Inc	1
7141	, Valencia , CA ) as per manufacturer ' s instructions	1
7142	One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed as per protocol using TaqMan ® RT reagents ( Applied Biosystems ) at 37 ° C for 120 min followed by 25 ° C for 10 min .	1
7143	Spacing	1
7144	A hallmark of @GENE$ - dependent @GENE$ signals is the necessity to maintain a precise spacing between @GENE$ and @GENE$ to position the ribosome appropriately at the @GENE$ ( 38 , 39 )	1
7145	The importance of spacing in PRRSV frameshifting was assessed in WG translations programmed with @GENE$ with spacer lengths of 4 - 13 nt ( Figure 6 )	1
7146	Efficient @GENE$ was seen over a narrow range ( 9 - 11 nt ) , with shorter spacers leading preferentially to − 2 @GENE$ and longer spacers preferentially to − 1 @GENE$	1
7147	This pattern of frameshifting is highly reminiscent of that observed with @GENE$ and suggests that the @GENE$ functionally mimics such RNAs	1
7148	The optimal spacer length was subtly different for the two @GENE$ , with maximal @GENE$ ( − 2 and − 1 ) seen at longer spacer lengths for added @GENE$ compared with @GENE$	1
7149	Thus the capacity of the various @GENE$ to promote frameshifting into a particular @GENE$ is likely set by the position and / or conformation of the @GENE$ on the template , affected by subtle differences in the position of @GENE$ within the proteins which influences ' effective ' spacer length .	1
7150	We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies	1
7151	Results show that detection of 0	1
7152	01 % GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using @GENE$ .	1
7153	When markets are included the pattern of spatial spread is found to be similar to that without markets ( electronic supplementary material , figure S12 )	1
7154	The three most highly infected counties on the full network are Cumbria , North Yorkshire and Aberdeenshire , with mean epidemic sizes of 210 , 258 and 238 , respectively	1
7155	When markets are included , we observe much larger epidemics in Devon , Somerset and northeast Wales	1
7156	We also observe that each of the three sampling methods compares well with the original network at the S min threshold	1
7157	Similar results are observed when outbreaks are seeded in Aberdeenshire and Devon - transmission within markets results in outbreaks with a much larger spatial extent than outbreaks in which markets do not play a role in transmission ( electronic supplementary material , figures S21 - S24 ) .	1
7158	A stochastic susceptible - infectious - recovered ( SIR ) model was used to investigate epidemic behaviour on the livestock network	1
7159	The probability of farm i becoming infected is defined as	1
7160	The findings of this study revealed that nurses need well - ventilated @DISEASE$ wards in the hospital	1
7161	The @DISEASE$ wards layout was not suitable and lacked ventilation , which increased risk of @DISEASE$ spread	1
7162	The working environment was not safe and did not meet the national standards guidelines for a @DISEASE$ ward setting , as recommended by South Africa [ 31 ]	1
7163	According to the study by Narasimhan et al	1
7164	[ 32 ] , overcrowding and poorly ventilated environments increase the risk of acquiring @DISEASE$ .	1
7165	Due to the nature of work that nurses provide to the patients , it is important that they receive special support from their management and colleagues in order for them to offer quality service	1
7166	The following sub - themes will be discussed under support system available in the hospital ; support from the managers , support from the psychologist and appreciation of staff .	1
7167	The anti - cancer activity of CPV is closely related to its apoptosis - inducing effect	1
7168	A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 induces apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway 37	1
7169	Coincidently , we found that @GENE$ was up - regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in this study	1
7170	@GENE$ is a pro - apoptotic regulator that plays a central role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation 38	1
7171	It suppresses tumourigenesis by mediating apoptosis of @DISEASE$ cells 39	1
7172	For example@GENE$ AK over - expression can effectively induce apoptosis in @DISEASE$ cells 40	1
7173	Also , elevations in BA@GENE$ otein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine @DISEASE$ cells 41	1
7174	In addition , VDAC2 , which can recruit newly syn@GENE$ ed BAK to the mitochondria to carry ou@GENE$ optosis 42 , was also up - regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in our study	1
7175	These findings remind us that the anti - cancer activity of CPV may be closely related to the over - expression of BAK1 and the mitochondrial apoptoti@GENE$ hway that is mediated by it	1
7176	Lakshman Santra et al	1
7177	suggest that CPV2 NS1 might be effective against @DISEASE$ with the p53 mutation 43	1
7178	As a critical effector of apoptosis , BAK can participate in the apopto@GENE$ process without activation of p53	1
7179	Therefore , over - expressi@GENE$ f the bak gene may be a new strategy fo@GENE$ atment of @DISEASE$ , especially for @DISEASE$ bearing p53 mutations .	1
7180	Bioinformatics data analysis	1
7181	The majority of the proteins in the Felis catus database are not annotated with biological functions	1
7182	Nevertheless , because most of the identified proteins shared high homologies to @GENE$ , we blasted @GENE$ defined by iTRAQ analysis with the H	1
7183	sapien protein database in Swissprot	1
7184	Only the proteins with at least 70 % identity were considered to be matched .	1
7185	The purpose of this analysis was to systematically investigate the potential effect of @GENE$ on the outcomes of @DISEASE$ patients requiring ECMO therapy	1
7186	We analyzed 57 patients ; 28 patients were treated with IgM - enriched IVIG , and 29 patients did not receive IVIG therapy	1
7187	Of all patients suffering from @DISEASE$ , 75 % of the IVIG - treated patients and 55 % of the control patients had severe @DISEASE$ of various origins	1
7188	However , although the IVIG group had a lower PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio and required longer ventilation support , longer vasopressor therapy , and longer anti - infective therapy and included @DISEASE$ patients , outcome parameters such as LOS in the ICU , LOS in the hospital , and mortality were not significantly different between the groups .	1
7189	Despite the long and controversial history of quarantine , little is known about lay perceptions of and attitudes toward its modern - day use	1
7190	In view of the evidence of potential adverse effects on individual well - being and psychosocial health , and owing to the critical necessity of high compliance in the event of a major @DISEASE$ outbreak , it is increasingly important to understand how quarantine is perceived by the general public	1
7191	Therefore , the objective of the present study was to determine prevailing public attitudes toward the use of quarantine as a means of @DISEASE$ control .	1
7192	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ that consists of @GENE$ of proteins ( @GENE$ or @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ )	1
7193	@GENE$ is maintained as a latent form in the cytoplasm of cells where it is complexed to @GENE$	1
7194	Seven members of the @GENE$ of proteins have been identified and includes @GENE$	1
7195	Upon activation of @GENE$ , @GENE$ is phosphorylated by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) leading to @GENE$ - dependent degradation of @GENE$ , which allows a rapid translocation of @GENE$ into the nucleus where it binds to DNA	1
7196	The most predominant @GENE$ activated is @GENE$	1
7197	Translocation of @GENE$ to the nucleus results in the transcription of several @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) [ 127 , 128 ] .	1
7198	Five species within the genus Leishmania have been identified in cats : @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in the New World , and @DISEASE$ infantum in both the New and Old Worlds ( Table 1 )	1
7199	We can therefore state that cats are likely to be infected by the same @DISEASE$ species found in humans or other animals in the same geographic area .	1
7200	Several characteristics that are reported in human @DISEASE$ brains were also observed in the present model , including neuronal loss in the amygdala and cerebral cortex 61 , and astrocytic activation in the white matter 62	1
7201	We and others have also previously demonstrated microglial activation , enh@GENE$ okine levels , incl@GENE$ L - 6 , and elevated oxidative damage in fetal brains 12 , [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ]	1
7202	In the MIA model , microglia play a major role , along with astrocytes , in synaptic pruning and neural circuit formation 2	1
7203	In addition , a single injecti@GENE$ L - 6 is known to lead to the same @DISEASE$ as those observed in the LPS models 66 ( IL - 6 is@GENE$ t to be a key cytokine in the link between @DISEASE$ and the @DISEASE$ in the offspring 38 )	1
7204	In our previous report , maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased IL - 6 levels@GENE$  @DISEASE$ fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the @DISEASE$ later in life	1
7205	Previous studies in adult rodents reported that H 2 treatment could mitigate the @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ , by regulating inflammation and ROS production 67 , 68 , which is in line with our current results	1
7206	Moreover , the present study demonstrated that prenatal H 2 administration restored the MIA - induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss , and suppressed the excessive activation of astrocytes at postnatal 5 weeks	1
7207	It was also shown that H 2 directly attenuated the LPS - induced expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including TNF - α , IL - 1β , and IL - 6 , in pri@GENE$ ese cytokine@GENE$ ow@GENE$ uce ap@GENE$  in oligodendrocytes and @DISEASE$ in the@GENE$ rodent 69	1
7208	Thus , the suppressive effect of H 2 on both microglial and astrocytic activation would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes against LPS exposure .	1
7209	Reports on experimental feline infections with @DISEASE$ spp	1
7210	are very scarce	1
7211	Only two studies have been reported with different species of the @DISEASE$ donovani complex and were both performed many years ago [ 39 , 45 ]	1
7212	This means that sensitive techniques such as PCR were not applied for monitoring infected cats	1
7213	A third study was conducted more recently in Brazil with L	1
7214	braziliensis [ 46 ]	1
7215	Parasitological , serological and clinical details on the experimental studies carried out in cats are shown in Table 3 .	1
7216	In some FeL cases , other @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ were also diagnosed [ 52 , 56 , 68 ] .	1
7217	@DISEASE$ - mediated @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ represent major public health challenges	1
7218	A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens , and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established ; however , its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic	1
7219	By contrast , we have previously shown that far - UVC light ( 207 - 222 nm ) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin	1
7220	This is because , due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer ( non living ) layers of human skin or eye ; however , because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions , far - UVC can penetrate and inactivate them	1
7221	We show for the first time that far - UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses , with a very low dose of 2 mJ / cm 2 of 222 - nm light inactivating > 95 % of aerosolized @DISEASE$ virus	1
7222	Continuous very low dose - rate far - UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising , safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airbornemediated @DISEASE$ .	1
7223	For the 143 @GENE$ , we checked sequence conservation at @GENE$ , at the @GENE$ of each gene , as well as the lengths of intergenic sequences between gene boundaries	1
7224	The length of the @GENE$ was different between group A and B viruses , that is , 13 nt and 2 nt , respectively	1
7225	The @GENE$ were the longest , up to 125 nt and to 190 nt , respectively	1
7226	Consensus nucleotides ( 9 to 19 length ) at the putative @GENE$ flanking the @GENE$ of the viral genes are shown in Fig	1
7227	1	1
7228	The @GENE$ of N and P were conserved ( > 90 % average pairwise identity ) in both HMPV groups , and the M2 and @GENE$ were also conserved in HMPV group A and B , respectively	1
7229	The putative @GENE$ was consistently located at @GENE$ of a @GENE$ ( consensus : GG / AGAC / TAAA / GTnnnnATG ) , except for the internal @GENE$	1
7230	An additional @GENE$ upstream of the gene - start motif was observed in the @GENE$ for the B1 and B2 strains	1
7231	In five of the eight annotated @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( B1 and B2 strains only ) ) , the intergenic regions were short and the @GENE$ for these 5 genes terminated within the @GENE$ .	1
7232	The runtime of this workflow has been profiled on a single server for an input of 42 sequences and N = 100 replica	1
7233	As can be seen form Figure 10 , the @GENE$ component clearly dominates the overall execution time and requires parallelization .	1
7234	The user creates a workflow by selecting workflow components from a predefined list of deployed components on the cluster	1
7235	Each component is configured to run on a particular cluster server or automatically assigned to a server if no explicit configuration is desired	1
7236	At run - time Quascade performs a remote invocation to the selected servers and creates local instances of the used components	1
7237	Hence , client - server communication takes place between a Quascade client and one or more instances of @GENE$ forming the cluster	1
7238	Complementary , server - server communication takes place between two or more servers or between a server and its compute nodes .	1
7239	Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global @DISEASE$ virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement , specifically , geographical proximity , demography and economic measures , antigenic divergence , epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support ( Fig	1
7240	2 )	1
7241	Instead , we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of @DISEASE$ viruses	1
7242	This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable ( * 1 on a log scale ) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model ( posterior probability	1
7243	0	1
7244	93 and Bayes factor	1
7245	760 )	1
7246	This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow , controlling for all other predictors	1
7247	The result is robust when we repeat the analysis ( i ) using different partitions of sampling locations ( air communities and different geographic partitions , Fig	1
7248	2 ) , ( ii ) using different sequence sub - samples for the air communities ( Fig	1
7249	S1 ) , ( iii ) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub - samples ( Fig	1
7250	S2 ) , and ( iv ) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion ( Fig	1
7251	S3 )	1
7252	We down - sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes ( Text S1 ) , which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes , explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model	1
7253	Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography , but by explicitly including them as predictive variables , we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias	1
7254	We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1	1
7255	5 .	1
7256	As both primary and secondary bacterial colonization of the oviduct can occur in birds contributing to abnormal eggs in shape , color and size , we carried out bacteriological examination on oviduct specimens that had resulted positive for the presence of @DISEASE$ by RRT - PCR to investigate the presence of relevant bacteria ( e	1

7260	, Enterococcus spp	1
7261	, Streptococccus spp	1
7262	, Pseudomonas spp	1
7263	)	1
7264	Moreover , specific PCRs for Mycoplasma synoviae and galllisepticum were performed from oviducts in order to rule out the onset of abnormal eggs due to @DISEASE$ .	1
7265	H9N2 virus qRRT - PCR positive samples were tested by IHC and a score was assigned to each section as follows : 0 no staining , 1 small clusters of positive cells , 2 multiple accumulations of positive cells and 3 extensive staining	1
7266	IHC was performed on 3 - µm sections , using an automated immunostainer	1
7267	For each oviduct section and sampling time scores were averaged	1
7268	The antigen retrieval was performed using the commercial ready to use solution @GENE$ ( Roche , Germany ) , at 36 ° C , for 12 min	1
7269	The slides were incubated with the @GENE$ ( Biodesign , USA ) targeting the @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ viruses applied at 1 : 1500 dilution , for 80 min at room temperature	1
7270	An ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit ( Roche , Germany ) was used as detection system	1
7271	A positive control consisting of a lung of an Influenza A positive chicken and a negative control consisting of a kidney of an Influenza A negative chicken were included in each run	1
7272	All of the tested tissues were also incubated with the negative control antibody MG2a - @GENE$ 15@GENE$  )@GENE$ ing the primary@GENE$ type .	1
7273	Because of the accelerated clinical course of recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT , strategy to prevent reinfection of the graft is needed	1
7274	An@GENE$ d been approved to successfully prevent @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT	1
7275	It is used in antibody therapy for @DISEASE$ - infected recipients	1
7276	However , recent stud@GENE$ lob@GENE$ ntibody show only transient decr@GENE$ HCV RNA levels in liver transplant recipients [ 62 , 63 ]	1
7277	Preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of @DISEASE$ before there is evidence of recurrent @DISEASE$	1
7278	It is usually initiated within one month after LT	1
7279	Compared to immunocompetent subjects , antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression	1
7280	A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV - RNA + @DISEASE$ patients who started a 12 - month IFN @GENE$  RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [ 64 ]	1
7281	The sustained virological response ( SVR ) was achieved in 33 % of patients	1
7282	None of the patients developed @DISEASE$ , and normal histology was also noted in patients with SVR after a median followup of 52 months	1
7283	However , higher than 26 % of @DISEASE$ was noted in another study using IFN and RBV comb@GENE$ ion therapy for more than 12 months [ 65 ]	1
7284	Moreover , four other studies using different regiments , two IFN monotherapy @GENE$ two pegylated - IFN monotherapy @GENE$ owed a poor effect of less than 20 % of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and @DISEASE$ [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ]	1
7285	Therefore , more prospective and large - scaled studies are still needed to investigate the most appropriate regimen for Preemptive treatment .	1

7309	More than 20 @DISEASE$ species have been classified , and many more unclassified hantaviruses have been identified	1
7310	They are hosted by several species of rodents ( Rodentia ) , insectivores ( Insectivora ) , and bats ( Chiroptera ) [ 4 ]	1
7311	Little work has been conducted to understand @DISEASE$ infections of insectivores or bats ; however , much is known about the ecology of rodent - borne hantaviruses because of their impact on human health ( Table 1 )	1
7312	A central problem of hantavirus / reservoir host research is the lack of reagents and methods for experimentally examining the immune response	1
7313	Recent experimental work on the immunology of rodent reservoirs , summarized in an exceptional review by Easterbrook and Klein [ 5 ] , has begun to clarify these issues	1
7314	The immune response is energetically expensive for wild animals , thus the findings of experimental studies will be critical for understanding the ecoimmunology of reservoir hosts of hantaviruses [ 6 , 7 ] , and experiments using wild rodents in natural or semi - natural environments [ 8 , 9 ] will be required to validate laboratory findings .	1
7315	First , we use analytical methods to show that ( i ) ignoring the latent period or ( ii ) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods ( when including the latent period ) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data	1
7316	We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an @DISEASE$ outbreak	1
7317	Finally , we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options .	1
7318	We declare evidence of an outbreak signature ( test positive ) , at time t if the observed detection value D k , t is larger than a given threshold	1
7319	For a fixed value of α , let 1 - α denote the specificity ( the probability of a true - negative )	1
7320	Similarly , the sensitivity is defined to be the probability of true positive	1
7321	The threshold , τ k , α , is chosen by solving P ( D k , t > τ k , α ) = α for τ k , α	1
7322	Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 - α quantile of the { D k , t } process of non - outbreak - based training data , or if { X k , t } is Gaussian then for large m ,	1

7324	Before the influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 pandemic in 2009 / 2010 , comparisons of clinical characteristics between patients infected with different @DISEASE$ types ( A vs	1
7325	B ) and between patients infected with different influenza A subtypes showed only small differences when controlling for age [ 9 , 10 ]	1
7326	During the pandemic , however , some studies observed increased morbidity and mortality among children compared to previous seasonal influenza [ 6 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] , while other studies described the clinical features of @GENE$ pdm09 as being similar or even milder [ 14 , 15 ]	1
7327	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and fatal @DISEASE$ was observed more frequently during the pandemic [ 16 ]	1
7328	Post - pandemic surveillance was recommended , as circulation of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 was expect@GENE$ r several years , gradually assuming a seasonal influenza pattern [ 16 ] .	1

7333	On ELISA , there were 33 ( 97	1

7335	The results of six samples , including one with borderline ELISA results , were negative in the @DISEASE$ and PRNT .	1
7336	Posttranslational modification of proteins by @GENE$ regulates synapse development and synaptic transmission	1
7337	Much progress has been made investigating the role of @GENE$ at the synapse , however very little is known about the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins	1
7338	Although there are far fewer @GENE$ than @GENE$ encoded by the @GENE$ , it is becoming clear that @GENE$ have very specific physiological functions , suggesting that @GENE$ activity is tightly regulated in vivo	1
7339	Many @GENE$ function as part of larger @GENE$ , and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression , localization and catalytic activity of @GENE$	1
7340	In this review article , we focus on the role of the DUB @GENE$ in the nervous system , and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating @GENE$ by describing how @GENE$ is regulated by two @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo .	1
7341	A regional network approach can enhance both bat conservation and @DISEASE$ mitigation efforts	1
7342	For instance , longitudinal studies of regional bat populations will aid in identifying shared threats to bats and human - mediated factors associated with increased disease emergence risk , both of which will likely change over time	1
7343	Yet few bat research networks actively incorporate capacity building and hands - on - training in disease surveillance ; however , the Red Latinoamericana para la Conservación de los Murciélagos ( RELCOM ) identifies emerging diseases as a conservation priority [ 79 ] and the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Unit ( SEABCRU ) provides protocols on personal protective equipment and safety when conducting @DISEASE$ surveillance [ 80 ]	1
7344	The Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats ( EUROBATS ) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop of public health officials , bat experts , and veterinarians to coordinate otherwise disjunct surveillance efforts for European bat lyssaviruses ( EBLV ) in several European countries [ 81 ]	1
7345	This workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on @DISEASE$ and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for @DISEASE$ surveillance programs in all European countries	1
7346	Taken together , collaboration is required among diverse experts , including bat conservationists , public health officials , and virologists , in order to build impactful One Health research agendas and formulate effective recommendations to mitigate shared regional threats to bat populations and human health .	1
7347	We next determined whether @GENE$ purified from cervicovaginal fluid and from seminal fluid could enhance transcytosis at low pH	1

7356	Cats fed both Diets A and B had a numerical reduction in the mean weekly number of vomiting episodes , with little to no change in weekly @DISEASE$ episodes , over the 4 - week period ( Table 2 )	1
7357	There were no differences between diet groups in the mean weekly number of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ episodes ( p > 0	1

7359	Significant differences were seen in vomiting episodes over time within cats fed Diet A between week 0 and weeks 2 - 4	1
7360	These had fold changes in the number of vomiting occurrences Table 3 )	1

7365	For @GENE$ reactions , @GENE$ were purchased from Sigmagenosys ( Table 1 )	1
7366	Reactions were performed in 20 μl containing 1 × Bst pol buffer ( NEB , Ipswich , UK ) with 0	1

7372	Template ( 1 μl ) was added to 9 μl of the mix and the samples denatured at 95 ° C for 2 mins and then cooled to 4 ° C	1
7373	@GENE$ was added to the remaining reaction mix to a concentration of 3	1
7374	2 U	1
7375	μl - 1 , mixed thoroughly , and 10 μl was added to each reaction	1
7376	Reactions were incubated at 55 ° C for 2 hours , followed by 80 ° C for 10 mins to inactivate the enzyme and stored at 4 ° C until analysed	1
7377	Aliquots of the reactions ( 5 μl ) were run on 1	1
7378	5 % ( w / v ) agarose gels , containing ethidium bromide	1
7379	The presence of the negative - sense strand of DWV , as indicated by a band at 221 bp of the agarose gel electrophoresis [ 49 , 52 ] was confirmed for all colonies of T1 at week 13 , but only for two colonies at week 16 ( Figure 2 )	1
7380	Similarly , the band at 221 bp was clearly visible in all but one colony of T2 at the first sampling point	1
7381	Four weeks later , the band was still well visible in one colony , less pronounced in two others , and not visible in three colonies .	1
7382	Calliphora nigribarbis has a characteristic temperate - zone life cycle	1
7383	For example , in Japan , they become more active between winter and spring for migration and reproduction [ 15 , 16 ]	1
7384	It is well known that C	1
7385	nigribarbis has excellent flight capacity and high dispersal ability	1
7386	They have been identified by weather ships at stations located on the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea , 300 - 450 km from Kyushu Island , Japan [ 17 ]	1
7387	It was also suggested that the number of flies found in autumn in the Kyushu District appears to increase due to their transoceanic migration [ 18 ]	1
7388	Female blow flies can survive for about one year in Japan [ 17 ] , in comparison to the house fly Musca domestica which has a mean longevity of 34	1
7389	2 days [ 19 ]	1
7390	The longevity and high dispersal ability of blow flies may also result in wide dispersion of viruses that they carry	1
7391	Mark - release - recapture experiments conducted at Tamba Town in 2005 suggested that C	1
7392	nigribarbis generally could migrate up to 2 - 3 km in 24 h [ 20 ]	1
7393	The distance between the two poultry farms in Kyoto prefecture , where the two @DISEASE$ outbreaks took place in 2004 , was approximately 4 km	1
7394	In fact , 10 % of all C	1
7395	nigribarbis flies collected at a site intermediate between the affected farms expressed H@GENE$  11 ]	1
7396	Viable titers of H5N1 influenza virus , but not virus replication , were detected for up to 24 h in the crop and intestine of virus - exposed C	1
7397	nigribarbis [ 10 ]	1
7398	The presence of infectious virus in blow flies for 24 h could have a strong implication for virus dispersion since blow flies , with their excellent flight capacity , could transport the H5N1 virus over significant distances	1
7399	In addition , H5N1 virus has been isolated from feces and vomit matter of blow flies at the 48 h postexposure , but virus titers in flies at 48 h were lower than that of the virus - containing cotton used in these experiments	1
7400	This suggested that the viability of influenza virus decreases steadily in the blow fly crop and intestine , although some infectious virus remains for longer than 24 h	1
7401	Therefore , C	1
7402	nigribarbis could transport H5N1 virus to poultry farms 2 - 3 km apart .	1
7403	Comparative phyloinformatics of @GENE$ at micro and macro levels in a distributed computing environment	1
7404	As described previously [ 8 ] , total nucleic acid was extracted from swabs and pooled equally according to RNA concentration	1
7405	Pooled samples were DNAse treated and @GENE$ depleted , then @GENE$ synthesis was performed	1
7406	Libraries were prepared using a KAPA @GENE$ Library Preparation Kit for Illumina ( KAPA Biosystems ) modified for low input samples , and were individually barcoded during the PCR reamplification step [ 10 ]	1
7407	The libraries included in this study were combined in equimolar ratios with other @GENE$ for sequencing on an Illumina @GENE$ at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research .	1
7408	The @GENE$ comprises 497 amino acids and is a component of the @GENE$	1
7409	The conserved sequence @GENE$ in the @GENE$ has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [ 7 ]	1
7410	It has been shown that @GENE$ regulates viral RNA replication through binding to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ [ @GENE$ ] ) and @GENE$ [ 8 ]	1
7411	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , another member of the family Flaviviridae , is an essential component of the re@GENE$ 9 ] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [ 10 , 11 ]	1
7412	The HCV NS5A - @GENE$ teraction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS@GENE$ d the production of infectious virus [ 12 ]	1
7413	The HC@GENE$ so plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [ 13 , 14 ]	1
7414	In addition , the CS@GENE$ creases IR@GENE$ mediated translation in a dose - dependent manner and the key sites ( K399 , T401 , E406 and L413 ) are also found in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 15 ]	1
7415	To date , studies have been focused on th@GENE$ V NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [ 8 , 15 ] , bu@GENE$  host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited .	1
7416	As strengths of our study we count 1 ) its sample size , allowing for the analysis of effect modification , 2 ) its prospective design involving 18 months infection diaries for the exploration of the relationship between BMI and subsequent @DISEASE$ frequency and severity , 3 ) the comprehensive information on lifestyle and co - morbidities allowing to study the interplay of such factors on their effect on infections , and 4 ) the wide range of outcome indicators considered	1
7417	The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of @DISEASE$ morbidity , studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different @DISEASE$ outcomes	1
7418	In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research , our study suffers from some limitations , including the reliance on self - reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification	1
7419	However , we found - for instance - a good agreement between BMI derived from self - reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub - cohort ( n = 508 )	1
7420	Moreover , differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ is rather unexpected in this setting	1
7421	The disproportional selection of women into the study may negatively impact the generalizability of some of our results .	1
7422	The differential inhibition of the viruses tested by the same supernatants is reflected by the distinct viral inhibition ratios observed ( Figure 5B - E and Table 1 )	1
7423	Sensitivity of each virus to @GENE$ correlated with sensitivity to the @GENE$ and induction of @GENE$ in target cells by the supernatants highly correlated with the inhibition of all viruses ( Figure 5F - I )	1
7424	Finally , @GENE$ derived from PBMCs of cats c08 , whose cells had indicated strong responsiveness to stimulation with ODN 2216 in previous experiments , most efficiently inhibited the replication of all viruses .	1
7425	Cells of the feline immune system were strongly influenced when cultured in the presence of ODN 2216	1
7426	First , feline PBMCs significantly proliferated in presence of ODN 2216 , indicating a direct and / or indirect stimulation of one or more immune cell subpopulations by this molecule	1
7427	Although in contrast to other classes of ODN @GENE$ does not generally induce lymphocyte proliferation in mice [ 12 ] , similar effects have previously been observed in ovine cells , where higher concentrations of @GENE$ could induce minimal levels of proliferation [ 68 ]	1
7428	Additionally , ODN 2216 increased the expression of @GENE$ in PBMCs , reinforcing possible interactions between various immune cell populations in subsequent specific responses	1
7429	While @GENE$ were upregulated on both lymphocytic and non - lymphocytic cells after ODN 2216 stimulation , @GENE$ expression could only be increased on lymphocytic cells	1
7430	This observation may be linked to the time point of our measurements , or to the necessity of transport to the cell surface of @GENE$ coupled with antigen for presentation to other immune cells	1
7431	Finally , the transcription of a series of markers of innate immune responses was considerably influenced in feline PBMCs by stimulation with ODN 2216	1
7432	The most astonishing effects of this molecule thereby remain the potent induction of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , with mRNA expression of these genes increased by up to 12 000 and 35 000 - fold respectively in PBMCs of certain animals	1
7433	In line with observations published recently , the induction of @GENE$ by this @GENE$ remained moderate [ 34 ] ; nevertheless , the measurements carried out 24 h after stimulation of purified feline cells support induction of Th1 - oriented immune responses and enhanced NK cell activity , both highly desired in the contexts of @DISEASE$ .	1

7439	Results from the zero - dose control studies ( Fig	1
7440	1 , top left ) confirmed that the aerosol irradiation chamber efficiently transmitted the aerosolized viruses through the system , after which the live virus efficiently infected the test mammalian epithelial cells	1
7441	Figure 2 shows the surviving fraction , as a function of the incident 222 - nm far - UVC dose , of exposed H1N1 aerosolized viruses , as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated epithelial cells relative to unexposed controls	1

7453	Due to its ability to interact with @GENE$ , @GENE$ , a protein from the St John ' s wort , has been put forward as a potential anti - HIV - 1 molecule by Darbinian et a l	1
7454	[ 104 ]	1
7455	Recently , the investigators have used the @GENE$ peptide as part of a bi - directional protein transduction system where the @GENE$ of interest , @GENE$ , was expressed with @GENE$ at its C - terminal	1
7456	Secreted into the cell medium , the @GENE$ efficiently entered @DISEASE$ - infected cells thro@GENE$ a tat - mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV - 1 transcription and replication ( Figure 1 ) .	1

7462	This would mean that not only tat @GENE$ sed the plasma membrane but they were also able to penetrate into the convoluted membrane system to interfere with viral replication .	1
7463	Iterative HFold : Given an @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and a pseudoknot free input structure , G , run the following four methods and pick the structure with the lowest free energy among these four as the output structure .	1
7464	Generation of a @GENE$ At the onset of these studies , there were no available commercial reagents to evaluate specific anti - ZIKV immune responses	1
7465	Therefore , by necessity , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was generated to support the assays performed in this study	1
7466	To generate this reagent , a @GENE$ based on the @GENE$ was cloned into a @GENE$ ( Supplementary Figure S2A )	1
7467	The @GENE$ was produced in E	1
7468	coli cultures , purified using nickel column chromatography and analysed using SDS - PAGE , which showed @GENE$ of the predicted size in lysate from rZIKV - E transfected bacteria that could be detected by western analysis using an @GENE$ ( Supplementary Figure S2B )	1
7469	The sera from mice immunised with the ZIKV - prME vaccine bound to @GENE$ that was used as a capture antigen in an ELISA ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; Supplementary Figure S2C )	1
7470	A commercial antibody ( designated panflavivirus ) that reacts to the @GENE$ of multiple flaviviruses , also bound to rZIKV - E	1
7471	Western analysis demonstrated that immune sera from ZIKV - prME immunised mice specifically recognised rZIKV - E ( Supplementary Figure S2D )	1
7472	These data indicate that the generated @GENE$ reacted specifically with immune sera from ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice , thus this @GENE$ was used for further immunogenicity studies .	1
7473	A long and growing list of compounds have been tested for their ability to replace colistin or other antibiotics for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs	1
7474	However , it is difficult to identify a single " ideal " solution for @DISEASE$ management	1
7475	Also , as was discussed above , @DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ disease and the exact overall etiology has not yet been fully elucidated , making it difficult to choose suitable alternatives	1
7476	Moreover , the most of these alternatives produce inconsistent results regarding their effectiveness in field conditions [ 107 ]	1
7477	Oral administration of specificantibody - containing egg yolk , or SDP to weaned piglets showed in some cases no protection against ETEC strains or @DISEASE$ outcomes , likely bec@GENE$ ntained antibodies were not specific against the infecting ETEC strains present on the farm [ 2 ]	1
7478	The composition of plant extracts , organic acids and probiotics is complex and knowledge regarding their mechanisms of action is poor , resulting in variable results and safety risks [ 87 ]	1
7479	Synergy mechanisms of probiotics and prebiotics are not very well known nor well studied [ 133 ]	1
7480	Although AMPs and bacteriophages helped in the treatment of @DISEASE$ , the bacterial resistance risk , the high cost and the narrow antibacterial spectrum of these alternatives reduce their practical use on farms [ 88 ]	1
7481	Vaccination is one of the most promising strategies for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs both in terms of preventive ability and cost - effectiveness [ 97 ]	1
7482	The control of production parameters ( temperature , ventilation , density , sanitation , biosafety , improvement of feed quality ) are crucial factors for the control of @DISEASE$ and the reduction of the use of antimicrobials during the post - weaning period [ 28 ]	1
7483	However , the improvement of farm conditions and management requires investment and awareness of pig farmers	1
7484	Furthermore , the use of regular diagnostic testing is crucial to ensure an appropriate choice of the antimicrobial and to monitor its effectiveness on farms	1
7485	Thus , efforts to improve microbiological laboratory detection methods are of paramount importance to help the veterinarian to act rapidly at an early stage of the disease [ 153 ] .	1
7486	In the case of @DISEASE$ in Toronto , the literature reported on both forms of responsibility	1
7487	While some of the literature attributed the responsibility to the Canadian health care system for being unprepared to manage @DISEASE$ , the other literature tended to ( or report on the ) how the public attributed blame to the Asian - Canadian community for Bbringing ^ the outbreak	1
7488	The latter narratives ultimately led to the racialization of the epidemic .	1
7489	@DISEASE$ claims over half a million lives in the United States annually , and @DISEASE$ is the number one cause of @DISEASE$ death in both men and women	1
7490	An estimated 226 , 160 new cases of @DISEASE$ was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone , and 160 , 340 @DISEASE$ deaths are estimated to occur [ 1 ]	1
7491	@DISEASE$ has been associated with an increased risk of @DISEASE$	1

7493	Of the five prostaglandins ( PG ) produced by COX - 2 , PGE 2 appeared to play @GENE$ l roles in @DISEASE$ cell proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , and immunosuppression [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
7494	Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1 - 4	1
7495	These receptors hav@GENE$ een implicated in @DISEASE$ cell growth and progression [ 6 , 7 ]	1
7496	PGE 2 is increased in patients with @DISEASE$ also showing a higher incidence of @DISEASE$ [ 8 ] .	1
7497	We present a new method , Iterative HFold , for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction	1
7498	Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot - free structure , and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any ( density - 2 ) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure	1
7499	Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods , namely the fast running time of HFold , a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis , and the energy parameters of @GENE$ V2	1

7501	Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information , with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54 % to 79 % as the user provides up to 40 % of the input structure	1
7502	Iterative HFold is much faster than @GENE$ V2	1

7504	Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than @GENE$ on our HK - PK and IP - pk168 data sets .	1
7505	The @GENE$ responsible for the increased proteolysis associated with aggressive forms of @DISEASE$ represent candidate therapeutic targets	1
7506	The over - expression @GENE$ PN on the surface and neo - vasculature of @DISEASE$ has made it the most studied member of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and the most targeted	1
7507	A number of groups have developed molecules targeting @GENE$ ranging from @GENE$ to synthetic peptidomimetic inhibitors of its enzymatic activity [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]	1
7508	Perhaps the most well - known for @GENE$ EASE$ is the cyclic tumor - homing peptide asparagine - glycine - arginine ( cyc - NGR ) originally discovered through in vivo peptide phage display 25	1
7509	This peptide has been radiolabeled for nuclear imaging and has been used to deliver therapeutic peptides and proteins in vivo to APN - expressing tissues [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] @GENE$ motif mimics the structu@GENE$ teins@GENE$ t APN is known to bind but not degrade	1
7510	There are a number of drawbacks associated with the use of the cyc - NGR peptide , foremost among them is deamidation of the asparagine residue 25	1
7511	This spontaneous reaction , enhanced when the asparagine is adjacent to a glycine residue , results in the formation of isoaspartate - glycine - arginine ( isoDGR ) which is a ligand capable of bindi@GENE$ egrin and several @GENE$ grins with lower affinity	1
7512	This deamidation can lead to decreased specificity and potential off target af@GENE$ ts 29	1
7513	Additionally , as further demonstrated by our study , the cyclic - NGR peptide alone is not therapeutic , rather it is only therapeutic when conjugated to toxins	1
7514	Thus , there is a great need for low - molecular w@GENE$ t APN - targeted therapeutics that are stable and specific .	1
7515	We observed a large month - to - month variation in the proportion of @DISEASE$ cases from whom we identified a res - piratory RNA virus , largely reflecting the epidemic pattern of @DISEASE$ in this sub - tropical setting	1
7516	A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel	1
7517	Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing @DISEASE$ in preschool children [ 64 ]	1
7518	Atypical bacteria , like Mycoplasma pneumoniae , cause @DISEASE$ more frequently in school - age children , but can also cause mild infections in younger children [ 65 ]	1
7519	@DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ are the main bacterial pathogens causing @DISEASE$	1
7520	However , nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy , young children [ 66 ]	1
7521	Moreover , their detection in @DISEASE$ is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [ 67 ] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings	1
7522	S	1
7523	pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of @DISEASE$ in children in hospital , especially in cases with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 68 ]	1
7524	The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the @DISEASE$ epidemic that peaked in December 2005 ( Figure 2 ) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of @DISEASE$ and B ( Figure 3 )	1
7525	There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for @DISEASE$ [ 69 ]	1
7526	Additionally , we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an @DISEASE$	1
7527	Again , quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with @DISEASE$ .	1
7528	The occurrence of @DISEASE$ during the course of our study exhibited substantial temporal variation and a clear epidemic pattern ( Figure 2 )	1
7529	In each of the three years , we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of @DISEASE$ at the end of the monsoon season in August to September	1
7530	There were also significant @DISEASE$ epidemics during winter , the first year peaking in February and the second year in December , but we observed no winter epidemic in the third year	1
7531	There were also smaller peaks of @DISEASE$ in spring	1
7532	Epidemics of infection with individual respiratory viruses contributed to literally all of these @DISEASE$ epidemics , such as the three @DISEASE$ epidemics ( the second of which was compounded by epidemics with @DISEASE$ InfB infections ) , an InfA epidemic superimposed on an hMPV epidemic , and a PIV3 epidemic ( Figure 3 )	1
7533	Displays of the spatial - temporal distribution of these individual epidemics are visualized in [ 24 ]	1
7534	PIV1 infections occurred in small numbers throughout the year , whereas only 17 cases of PIV2 infection were seen during the entire study period .	1
7535	A tool for controllable annotation - based conversion of @GENE$ into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service , fostering links between quality of sequence annotation , and efficiency of communication and knowledge dissemination among researchers .	1
7536	Exposures to indoor and outdoor originating pollutants were associated with a burden	1
7537	The third approach to optimizing ventilation for health focuses first on indoor sources of exposures	1
7538	Now , instead of attempting to dilute these sources as they are , they are first assumed to be controlled by other means as much as technically feasible before optimizing the ventilation for health	1
7539	The assumed control potentials for the considered pollutants were :	1
7540	Based on the results of CFD simulation , the infection risks of the occupants were investigated by using the dose - response model in the risk assessment [ 36 ]	1
7541	The exposure levels of the passengers were assessed according to the concept of intake fraction [ 18 , 37 ] , which demonstrated the fraction of the quantity of pathogens deposited on the target infection site in the respiratory tract to the total quantity of pathogens produced by the index patient [ 38 ] :	1

7545	In human macrophage - like U937 cells , carvacrol suppressed LPS - induced COX - 2 mRNA and protein expression , suggesting that carvacrol regulates @GENE$ expression through its agonistic effect on @GENE$ [ 132 ]	1
7546	However , this property of carvacrol was not as remarkable as was that of citral [ 147 ] .	1
7547	In addition to the effect of Cryptomeria japonica essential oil on the LPS - treated RAW 264	1
7548	7 cells , which presented a remarkable inhibition of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , as reported above , the authors also detected an inhibition of NO production by reducing @GENE$ protein and mRNA @GENE$ expression as well as a diminution of @GENE$ 2 due to the reduction of @GENE$ protein and @GENE$ expression [ 115 ] .	1
7549	To determine whether the incorporation of @GENE$ onto HIV - 1 virions could be observed in conditions of endogenous expression , we first tested several @GENE$ for their ability to specifically recognize individual @GENE$ ( on HEK293T cells transfected with the individual @GENE$ , Additional file 2 : Figure S2 )	1
7550	This analysis indicated a certain level of cross - recognition between @GENE$ ( particularly with the @GENE$ )	1
7551	For this reason , we decided to detect the endogenous expression of @GENE$ using a pool of the 3 antibodies	1
7552	We first determined the pattern of expression of @GENE$ in different established cell lines and primary cells ( Figure 4A )	1
7553	Given that @GENE$ are @GENE$ , these cells were also stimulated for 24 hours with 1000 U / mL of @GENE$	1
7554	The basal expression of @GENE$ varied among cell types and was undetectable in HEK293T cells , unless @GENE$ was provided	1
7555	HeLa cells expressed instead robust levels of @GENE$ even in the absence of @GENE$ , although this stimulus further increased their expression	1
7556	Similarly , the primary human cells examined here expressed undetectable / low amounts of @GENE$ under standard conditions , but expression of @GENE$ was robustly induced by @GENE$ stimulation	1
7557	This trend was reproducibly observed in four distinct donors , although the basal levels of expression of @GENE$ displayed clear donor - to donor variations .	1
7558	Feline PBMC isolation , cell lines , ODNs , cell culture and cell viability assay Feline PBMCs were isolated from EDTA - anticoagulated whole blood by Ficoll - Hypaque density gradient centrifugation using a standard protocol [ 56 ]	1
7559	Purified cells were counted prior to their utilization in the different experiments using the Sysmex XT 2000iV ( Sysmex , Norderstedt , Germany ) as described previously [ 57 ] , and cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I ( Gibco ® , Invitrogen , Basel , Switzerland )	1
7560	Adherent CRFK ( ATCC no	1
7561	CCL - 94 ) and FEA cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I , while adherent fcwf - 4 cells ( ATCC no	1
7562	CRL - 2787 ) were cultured in EMEM ( ATCC	1
7563	The research participants freely responded to open - ended questions in narrative form using their own words , thus sharing their own perspectives with the researcher	1
7564	Questions were not planned in an inflexible manner	1
7565	The questions were not asked in a pre - arranged sequence , but the researcher ensured that all relevant topics were covered and that the research focus was kept in mind	1
7566	The researcher also asked probing questions to guide participants to elaborate further upon their responses where additional information were required or where unclear answers required more clarity	1
7567	This resulted in gaining in - depth accounts about participants ' experiences while caring for @DISEASE$ patients	1
7568	Data was collected by means of audio - recordings , field notes , and in - depth interviews .	1
7569	The reduction of macrophages in number might be due to the induction of apoptosis by @DISEASE$ virus in vitro infection as previous reported [ 36 ]	1
7570	To understand the mechanisms responsible for the reduction of the number of macrophage , we performed another experiment to confirm whether the macrophages were infected with vaccinia virus inoculation	1
7571	However , based on PCR analyses ;@GENE$  was not present in liver tissue that contained macrophages ( Figure S7 )	1
7572	Furthermore , apoptosis of macrophages was not detected in liver samples ( Data not shown )	1
7573	Based on these results , it is unlikely that the reduction in the number of macrophages was due to apoptosis induced by @DISEASE$ infection	1
7574	Although rVV - N25 reduced the number of macrophage , precise mechanism is still unknown	1
7575	Further examination to elucidate the mechanism is required .	1
7576	Immunization with @GENE$ suppressed HCV protein levels in the liver , and this suppression was associated with ameliorated pathological @DISEASE$ findings ( see Figure 3 )	1
7577	Importantly , rVV - N2@GENE$ t did not cause @DISEASE$ based on the serum ALT levels @GENE$ erefore , this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes	1
7578	These findings provided strong evidence that rVV - N25 t@GENE$ ffectively halted the progression of @DISEASE$	1
7579	Immunization with plasmid DNA or with@GENE$  vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with @DISEASE$ infection [ 20 , 21 ]	1
7580	However , findings from these previous studies revealed HCV immunization of both uninfected , naïve animals and immune - tolerant animals induced a HCV - specific immune response	1
7581	In the model describe here ; the animals were immune competent for HCV ; therefore , our findings provided further important evidence that rVV - N25 was@GENE$  in the treatment of @DISEASE$ .	1
7582	Background : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a key @GENE$ that plays a crucial role in host survival during infection by pathogens	1
7583	Therefore , it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular @GENE$ activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host .	1
7584	The qRRT - PCR detected @GENE$ in all of the organs that are commonly assumed to be the target of LPAI viruses , namely the duodenum , the cecal tonsil or the lungs in 83 % of the birds , throughout the study	1
7585	Moreover , at least one of the four sections of the oviduct was positive by qRRT - PCR in 71 % , 57 % and 14 % of the layers on days 4 , 6 and 10 pi , respectively ( Table 1 ) .	1
7586	Histological examinations described a mild superficial @DISEASE$ and a @DISEASE$ with heterophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the serosa of the duodenum of 2 / 4 subjects , on day 4 pi	1
7587	Similarly , the cecal tonsils of these birds had a focal infiltrate of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the serosa	1
7588	On day 6 pi , in 4 / 4 of the birds we recorded at the level of the duodenum a @DISEASE$ with a mild to moderate @DISEASE$ , and in two of these animals we also observed a @DISEASE$ .	1
7589	As virus release remained unaffected , one explanation for the defect in @GENE$ processing would be direct inhibition of the @GENE$ by the DIs @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
7590	To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of these DIs on the in vitro processing of @GENE$	1
7591	Purified @GENE$ derived from the @GENE$ construct [ 32 ] , encoding a @DISEASE$ - 1 mutant virus , were lysed and incubated with 2	1

7595	Although the DI P22077 and PR@GENE$ clea@GENE$ ed Gag processin@GENE$ none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ) .	1
7596	In the UK , an annual livestock census records the location and species composition of all livestock farms	1
7597	Births , deaths and movements of animals are recorded for individual cattle via the Cattle Tracing System ( CTS ) , and for batches of other livestock via the Animal Movement Licence scheme	1
7598	Such data have driven the development of sophisticated models to capture and predict the spread of @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ [ 1 , 8 , 17 , 18 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 12 , 19 ] and Escherichia coli [ 20 ]	1
7599	However , many countries around the world do not routinely collect farm - level data , or they are not readily available for research owing to issues regarding privacy	1
7600	For example , in the USA , the National Agricultural Statistics Service carries out an agricultural census every 5 years	1
7601	In order to preserve anonymity for farmers , all data are aggregated at the county level , and therefore precise locations of livestock farms are unknown	1
7602	Furthermore , movement data are held at the individual state level , and there is no requirement for livestock movements to be recorded unless movements are out of state [ 21 ]	1
7603	In the UK , the poultry industry infers movements between holdings using targeted sampling of premises based upon their function and size	1
7604	This method predominantly targets large farms , and therefore does not accurately capture the demographic characteristics of the underlying farm population [ 22 ]	1
7605	Therefore , it is important to understand the ability of models to predict the potential for disease spread through livestock movements when only a partial sample of the network is available .	1
7606	S	1
7607	suis is a Gram - positive , facultatively anaerobic coccus , which can be a commensal or pathogen for a wide range of mammalian species , particularly pigs	1
7608	The natural habitat of S	1
7609	suis in pigs is the upper respiratory - , the genital - and alimentary tracts	1
7610	Based on differences in antigenic properties of the polysaccharide capsule , 33 serotypes have been distinguished to date , among which serotype 2 is most commonly associated with @DISEASE$ in both pigs and humans	1
7611	To date little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease or the portals of entry in humans	1
7612	From small case series , the reported risk factor included occupational exposure , such as in slaughter house workers , butchers , and pig breeders , meat processing , and pig transport	1
7613	It is hypothesized that patients may be infected through minor cuts or abrasions on their skin [ 2 , 6 ]	1
7614	However , whilst occupational exposure to pigs or pork was documented in 88 % of the European patients described , it was reported in less than 50 % of Asian cases [ 4 , 7 ] , suggesting the contribution of other behavioural or exposure related risk factors in Asian populations , such as culinary habits or close proximity of pigs within households	1
7615	In addition , whilst it is known that pigs can carry S	1
7616	suis asymptomatically , it is not known if there is asymptomatic carriage of S	1
7617	suis in humans , which could potentially contribute to an increased risk of infection , and to the possibilitiy of person - to - person transmission	1
7618	We conducted a prospective case - control study to identify the risk factors of @DISEASE$ infection in Viet Nam .	1
7619	Sarcomeric structural protein Tnni3 @GENE$ The @GENE$ couples calcium availability with muscle contraction ( Takeda et al	1

7621	To verify these findings and to evaluate the mechanism of cell cycle regulation after 3D and 3C transfection , we performed Western blotting assays to examine their effect on the expression of @GENE$	1
7622	Consistent with the cell cycle analyses , 3D down - regulated the expression of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( Figure 4E ) , while 3C down - regulated the expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Figure 4F )	1
7623	Therefore the @GENE$ facilitates exit from G2 / M and the @GENE$ mediates arrest in G0 / G1 ( Figure 4G ) .	1
7624	Enterovirus 68 ( EV - D68 ) usually causes mild to severe @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and in the cases of some infants , children and teens , death	1
7625	Although EV - D68 was first identified in California in 1962 , the number of people in one breakout in 2014 with confirmed @DISEASE$ was much greater than the number reported in previous years ( http : / / www	1
7626	cdc	1
7627	gov / @DISEASE$ / about / ev - d68	1
7628	html )	1
7629	It is hard to predict whether EV - D68 will emerge again in future outbreaks , but the value of resolving the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 is obvious	1
7630	In this study , we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 to reveal the relationship between virus infection and the host cell cycle .	1
7631	@DISEASE$ and increased serum creatinine are also reported at diagnosis or during follow - up in some cases [ 37 , 68 ] .	1
7632	@DISEASE$ with increased gammaglo@GENE$ ported in FeL is usually found in chronic infections caused by viruses , bacteria or systemic fungi , or inflammation associated with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , or in @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ .	1
7633	Background : Young children with @DISEASE$ pose a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge to the pediatrician	1
7634	We aimed to evaluate @DISEASE$ as a possible reason for non response to conventional @DISEASE$ therapy , and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved .	1
7635	The Hymenocallis littoralis , an ornamental and medicinal plant , had been traditionally used for wound healing	1
7636	In the present study , an analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H	1

7638	The separation was achieved using a reversed - phase column	1
7639	The method was found to be accurate , repeatable , and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples	1
7640	The highest lycorine content was found in the bulb extract ( 2	1

7645	Few callus culture samples had high content of lycorine , comparable to that of wild plants	1

7656	The Annotation Support Server supports two distinct capabilities relating to the annotation of @GENE$ : de novo annotation of protein or DNA sequences , and aggregation of annotations into subsystems	1
7657	The Annotation Support Server accepts either DNA or @GENE$ as input and , depending on the user options , can either use existing gene calls or invoke standard gene callers ( e	1
7658	g	1
7659	, @GENE$ - 3 for @GENE$ )	1
7660	The server also houses newly developed high - performance methods to assign function to @GENE$ or regions of @GENE$ , based on @GENE$ [ 22 ]	1
7661	Below is an example application using these methods that produces a relatively accurate annotation of most @GENE$ within a few minutes	1
7662	To evaluate the technology , users are encouraged to simply submit a known @GENE$ to the server for annotation .	1
7663	While bats are well prepared to control @DISEASE$ , they also have mechanisms to avoid over - induction of inflamm@GENE$ excessive inflammation is detrimental in vertebrates of other species , such as humans , and is linked to pathology [ 28 ]	1
7664	So , it is beneficial for the bats to have evolved mechanisms that would allow them to control @DISEASE$	1

7666	Genome analysis of black flying foxes and @DISEASE$ have also demonstrated positive selection pressure on the cRel gene [ 21 ]	1
7667	This@GENE$ that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNFα , thereby maintain@GENE$  balanced response to @DISEASE$ .	1
7668	The Scientific World Journal maritimum [ 2 ] and Sternbergia species [ 14 ] as well as tissue culture of Pancratium maritimum [ 15 ] , Narcissus confusus [ 10 ] , and Leucojum aestivum [ 16 ] .	1
7669	These models include ambient temperature records collected in each city , as a covariate	1
7670	We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the annual @DISEASE$ season	1
7671	Also , a patient visit count series is included in the models to account for variations between - EDs ( like ED sizes ) and within - EDs ( day - of - week , for example )	1
7672	Addressing the fact that the underlying process is neither " independent or stationary " , our interest is to model the underlying " respiratory - complaint background " , using the available covariates and significant temporal dependencies present in the data	1
7673	Without modeling the spatial dependence directly , we investigate whether or not there is evidence of spatial homogeneity in the statistical models across cities	1
7674	We use filter - based prediction methods to indicate evidence of @DISEASE$ ( e	1
7675	g	1
7676	, due to @DISEASE$ attack ) using chest radiograph data	1
7677	We describe the form and function of various filters that are commonly used to detect outbreak signatures	1
7678	Using a stochastic model for an @DISEASE$ attack , we assess the performance of these methods	1
7679	Since there are no data that contain outbreak patterns , the use of a model is key to providing realistic outbreak patterns that can accurately be used to evaluate these statistical detection methods .	1
7680	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ resistance in pigs and the possible link between colistin pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic ( PK / PD ) and emergence of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in swine , as well as the aspects that should be considered to ensure judicious use of colistin in swine production , have been investigated in our last two reviews [ 18 , 25 ] .	1
7681	First reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) in September 2012 , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is now frequently detected and causing high mortality among persons living or traveling in the Arabian Peninsula	1
7682	1 Retrospective testing has revealed that MERS - CoV was also circulating in Zarqa , Jordan as early as April 2012 , causing at least 2 deaths and likely 7 close contact infections	1
7683	2 Since then , virus spread has seemingly increased	1
7684	Between April 2012 and May 2014 , there have been 536 reports of laboratory - confirmed human cases of @DISEASE$ , of which , 145 ( 27 % ) have perished	1
7685	3 The majority of the initially reported cases of @DISEASE$ in KSA were sporadic , associated with severe illness , and diagnosed in tertiary care hospitals	1
7686	3 , 4 As surveillance efforts have expanded , a number of @DISEASE$ cases with milder clinical disease have been recognized	1
7687	In this study of archive sera , we sought to examine evidence that subclinical @DISEASE$ may have occurred in early 2012 .	1
7688	The recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N produced stable amounts of @GENE$ upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus - specific promoter @GENE$ [ 46 ]	1
7689	Moreover , the @GENE$ produced in MVA - MERS - N infected cells was strongly recognized by @GENE$ from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that @GENE$ - specific immune responses were potently activated upon @DISEASE$ infection	1
7690	It seems noteworthy that MERS - CoV productively replicates in rabbits , but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms	1
7691	However , Haagmans et al	1
7692	found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the M@GENE$ n bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose [ 60 ]	1
7693	The localization of N@GENE$ n these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity [ 61 ]	1
7694	This might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of M@GENE$ espite a barely productive @DISEASE$ infection	1
7695	Similar outcomes of infection were observed upon @DISEASE$ CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non - human primate models [ 62 , 63 ]	1
7696	Thus , the induction of@GENE$  - specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the@GENE$  to serve as vaccine antigen .	1
7697	Further , we examined the turnover of @GENE$ in IΚKβ and ORF2 co - expressing cells since @GENE$ is the major inhibitor of @GENE$ activity in unstimulated cells	1
7698	By performing a pulse chase assay , using [ 35 S ] - cys / met labeling mix , the half - life of @GENE$ in IKKβ expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes , whereas in cells expressing both @GENE$ and @GENE$ , approximately 15 % of Heterologous expression of @GENE$ protein inhibits @GENE$ activity	1
7699	( A ) Huh7 cells were cotransfected in duplicate with @GENE$ and @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
7700	48 hour post transfection , cells were treated with 100 ng / ml TPA for 30 minutes and @GENE$ activity was assayed	1
7701	Spot intensity was quantified using NIH Image program and percentage @GENE$ activity was calculated assuming the highest value as 100 % .	1
7702	The ability to detect the presence of GMO is pivotal for consumers to be able to exercise their lifestyle choice of whether to consume , or not , food containing GMOs	1
7703	Though the detection and quantification of @GENE$ using immunoassay has been reported [ 1 ] , denaturation of the protein during processing makes the method unsuitable for GMO testing and quantification of food	1
7704	The durability of DNA makes it a better substrate for testing and its amplification by PCR is the method of choice , as recommended by the EC ( 2004 / 787 ) , for detection and quantification of GMO in samples .	1
7705	Passive transfer of @GENE$ has been shown to reduce the severity of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 26 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 27 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 28 ]	1
7706	Previously , we generated 4 murine monoclonal antibodies that @GENE$ oup B isolates of EV71 in vitro	1
7707	Therefore , we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model	1
7708	Here we s@GENE$  that by using N3 , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice inf@GENE$ ed by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
7709	We concluded that treatment of N3 ( 200 mg ) at an early stage ( 3 h post infection ) after infection afforded complete protection	1
7710	A lower dose ( 70 mg ) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90 % protection	1
7711	The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection , even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis	1
7712	This suggested that the protection conferred by N3 is in a dose and time - dependent manner .@GENE$ 	1
7713	Through reconstitution of the PRRSV − 2 / − 1 @GENE$ signal in vitro , we show here that in addition to the viral transactivator @GENE$ [UNK] , efficient frameshifting requires the participation of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
7714	In mammalian cells , two @GENE$ subsets have been described , @GENE$ ( 21 ) and the [UNK] CP proteins [UNK] @GENE$ and [UNK] @GENE$ , often referred to as @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 22 , 23 )	1
7715	The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 24 )	1
7716	@GENE$ are members of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and have a wide spectrum of biological activities , including the regulation of RNA splicing , the stabilization of @GENE$ , transcriptional activation and inhibition , and translational silencing and enhancement ( reviewed in Refs	1
7717	25 , 26 )	1
7718	Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays , we demonstrate that a complex of @GENE$ [UNK] and @GENE$ binds to the RNA downstream of the @GENE$ and mimics the action of the more typical @GENE$ of programmed frameshifting	1
7719	This unprecedented frameshift - stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by @GENE$	1
7720	Further , it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with @GENE$ and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions .	1
7721	From clinical experience and scientific reports , it is apparent that @DISEASE$ are a heterogeneous group of which only part will benefit from the use of ICS [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]	1
7722	Several authors recommend an extensive work - up in ICS non - responders , including @DISEASE$ and allergy testing , sweat chloride test and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage ( FOB + BAL ) to evaluate for underlying structural anomalies , comorbidities , underlying @DISEASE$ and an infectious etiology [ 2 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 ] .	1
7723	The asymptomatic infection was acquired via healthcare - associated transmission	1
7724	Thus , it is necessary to extend serologic studies to include inpatient contacts who have no symptoms .	1
7725	Based on the observed cases , the minimum incidence for PCR - confirmed influenza - associated @DISEASE$ admission per 100 , 000 children < 17 years of age in Bavaria was calculated as 1	1
7726	15 / 0	1
7727	36 / 1	1
7728	03 for seasons 1 / 2 / 3 , respectively	1
7729	Taking into account that the observed cases were based on data from 67 % / 47 % / 57 % of all eligible PICUs , the total number of influenza - associated @DISEASE$ admissions in Bavaria was estimated and corrected incidences were calculated as 1	1
7730	72 / 0	1
7731	76 / 1	1
7732	80 per 100 , 000 children < 17 years	1

7735	An essential oil is defined internationally as the product obtained by hydrodistillation , steam distillation or dry distillation or by a suitable mechanical process without heating ( for Citrus fruits ) of a plant or some parts of it [ 1 ]	1
7736	They are aromatic oily liquids , volatile , characterized by a strong odour , rarely coloured , and generally with a lower density than that of water	1
7737	They can be synthesized by all plant organs ( flowers , buds , seeds , leaves , twigs , bark , herbs , wood , fruits and root ) and therefore extracted from these parts , where they are stored in secretory cells , cavities , canals , epidermic cells or glandular trichomes [ 2 , 3 ]	1
7738	Essential oils only represent a small fraction of plant ' s composition ; nevertheless they confer the characteristics by which aromatic plants are used in the food , cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [ 4 ] .	1
7739	To directly assess whether elevated T cell activation is antigen driven or more polyclonal in nature , we measured the frequencies of both virus - specific as well as SR CD4 + T cells in CLN following @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion	1
7740	Frequencies of virus - specific CD4 + T cells , as analyzed by IFN - γ secreting cells following viral peptide M 133 stimulation , were not altered in DTR + compared to DTR − mice ( Figure 3 )	1
7741	However , reflecting overall increased cellularity , their absolute numbers increased more than threefold ( Figure 3 )	1
7742	We next assessed how Foxp3 + @GENE$ regulate SR - specific CD4 + T cells in CLN	1
7743	Similar to virus - specific CD4 + T cells , myelin - specific endogenous CD4 + T cells are activated in CLN , albeit at later times correlating with @DISEASE$ ( 13 )	1
7744	More importantly , @DISEASE$ presentin@GENE$ g are present in CLN of chronically infected mice ( 13 )	1
7745	Analysis of SR IFN - γ - secreting MOG 35 − 55 an@GENE$ P 60 − 80 specific CD4 + T cell frequencies revealed a threefold increase followin@GENE$ 3 @GENE$ g depletion compared to the very low frequencies in DT - treated DTR − mice ( ~ 30 cells per 10 6 CLN cells ; Figure 3 )	1
7746	Higher frequencies of SR T cells thus correlated with an overall ninefold increase of MOG 35 − 55 an@GENE$ P 60 − 80 specific CD4 + T cell numbers within the CLN of DTR + mice compared to controls ( Figure 3 )	1
7747	These data indicated tha@GENE$ s unspecifically regulate overall CLN cellularity and T cell activation during @DISEASE$ persistence but specifically limit expansion of SR CD4 T cells emerging after onset of @DISEASE$	1
7748	( 20 )	1
7749	Surprisingly however@GENE$ p3@GENE$ eg depletion altered neither total CNS cellular infiltration ( Figure 4A ) nor frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes ( Figure 4B ) at d28 p	1
7750	i	1
7751	Percentages of CD11b + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells , including virus - specific CD8 + , all remained similar irrespective @GENE$ p3@GENE$ eg depletion ( Figures 4C , D )	1
7752	T cell activation in the CNS cannot readily be deduced by their phenotype as the majority of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express a CD44 + CD62L low CD69 + effector phenotype throughout infection ( 27 )	1
7753	Nevertheless , as anticipated , we found no phenotypic T cell differences in DT - treated DTR − compared to DTR + mice ( data not shown )	1
7754	Similar overall T cell effector function was supported by identical levels of mRNA encoding pro - inflammatory cytokines IFN - γ and IL - 2 in both brain and spinal cord ( Figure 4E )	1
7755	No apparent differences in T cell numbers or function were also reflected in identical levels of persisting viral mRNA in both brains and spinal cords ( Figure 4F )	1
7756	These data indicated that viral persistence was not regulated by Foxp3 + Tregs , distinct from CLN	1
7757	Finally , no overt differences in demyelination in Foxp3 + Treg ablated mice indicated a minor , if any , role of this Treg subset in CNS tissue damage ( Figure 4G )	1
7758	These data demonstrated that Foxp3 + Tregs control T cell activation and inflammatory responses within CLN but have no effect on CNS inflammation and pathology during chronic JHMV infection .	1
7759	A neutral red ( NR ) cytotoxicity assay was performed to test cell viability after treatment with @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
7760	@GENE$ and @GENE$ at concentrations ranging from 1	1
7761	5625610 23 units to 0	1
7762	05 units were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator ( iNCYTO )	1
7763	Uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm .	1
7764	One recurring challenge in the global control of @DISEASE$ is the development of drug - resistant viral strains	1
7765	It is very likely that escape mutants will arise during treatment , especially if long - term therapy is required	1
7766	This issue can be overcome if treatment can be easily switched to different antisense molecules	1
7767	The ease to synthesize a new CPP - P@GENE$  s@GENE$  di@GENE$ d to the mutated@GENE$ o be addressed	1
7768	According to Stein , PPMO pr@GENE$ ion is costly and complex [ 60 ]	1
7769	Most investigators limited their in vi vo studies to the most potent PPMO id@GENE$ ied in cell culture	1
7770	However , treatment with a combination of antisense molecules targeting multiple sequences in the viral g@GENE$ have a greater antiviral effect compared to a treatment with a single antisense molecule , and should prevent selection of escape variants	1
7771	More studies with treatment with a cocktail of antivirals would be of critical relevance for further clinical applications .	1
7772	Virus containing cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection of HEK293T cells with @GENE$ and passed through a 0	1
7773	45 µm pore - size filter	1
7774	Virus was pelleted	1
7775	We compare the accuracy of @GENE$ , @GENE$ - PKonly and Iterative HFold with each other on different input structures , and with other methods , namely SimFold [ 63 ] , HotKnots V2	1
7776	0 [ 36 , 41 ] and @GENE$ [ 42 ]	1
7777	We first describe the latter two methods and the settings we choose for our experiments	1
7778	We then describe the ways in which we choose input structures for @GENE$ and its variants .	1
7779	Managers should ensure that @DISEASE$ wards are conducive and adhere to stipulated standards of preventing the spread of infection .	1
7780	This qualitative study was conducted from September 2017 to May 2018	1
7781	We used a purposive sampling method to recruit informants in key roles across sectors relevant to the issue of @DISEASE$ in Singapore	1
7782	Potential participants were identified from experts in the area of @DISEASE$ in Singapore , and were approached for an in - depth interview via email explaining the purpose of research	1
7783	A total of 21 participants from within and outside Singapore were recruited in this study ( Table 1 )	1
7784	The participants held expertise in human , animal , or environmental health and worked at either ministry , healthcare institution , academia , or civil society	1
7785	Most participants were from the human health sector	1
7786	We had difficulty recruiting participants from the environmental sector as potential participants showed more reservation in accepting the invitation to be interviewed , perhaps based on less knowledge about @DISEASE$	1
7787	We were eventually able to recruit an academic and public health official from the environmental sector	1
7788	Face - to - face in - depth interviews were conducted by three of the researchers ( S	1

7798	Among the interviewers , two were Research Associates and one was an Associate Professor	1
7799	All interviewers were trained in qualitative research	1
7800	The interviews were conducted in a quiet space at the preferred location of the participants	1
7801	Each interview lasted an hour on average and was audio - recorded	1
7802	There were no repeat interviews	1
7803	A semi - structured question guide was used to explore the main areas of concern for the participants , in their fields and areas of interest	1
7804	The question guide was developed with questions focusing on participants ' experiences and perceptions of @DISEASE$ policy and practice including awareness , key challenges and facilitators in their particular area of expertise , and possible strategies and solutions to address key challenges in the Singaporean context	1
7805	Participants were not remunerated for the interview .	1
7806	The entire irradiation chamber was set up inside a certified class II type A2 biosafety cabinet ( Labconco , Kansas City , MO )	1
7807	All air inputs and outputs were equipped with HEPA filters ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Pittsburgh , PA ) to prevent unwanted contamination from entering the chamber as well as to block any of the virus from releasing into the environment .	1
7808	Seasonal qualitative and quantitative differences in composition and antioxidant activities of male and female leaf essential oils of Pistacia atlantica were observed	1
7809	The main components of male leaf essential oil were α - pinene / α - thujene , spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene	1
7810	The major component of female leaf essential oil was δ - 3 - carene	1
7811	The seasonal variation showed that most of the main components of the oils reached theirs highest values in September	1
7812	The highest antioxidant capacity to scavenge free DPPH radicals was reached in the month of June for male oils and during the months of September - October for the female oils	1
7813	The high reducing power for male oil was detected during the month of June and for the female oil was in August	1
7814	The antioxidant activity of the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay [ 81 ] .	1
7815	The oils from young and mature leaves of Ageratum scoparia Waldst	1
7816	& Kit	1
7817	displayed a high degree of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity	1
7818	However , the scavenging activity of principle constituents , β - myrcene and p - cymene , was very less compared to that of oils	1
7819	The same authors [ 83 ] also evaluated the antioxidant activity of the samples by the DPPH method and also reported less activity of the main constituents of the oils than the essential oils , nevertheless the mature leaf oils were more effective as antioxidants than young leaf oils .	1
7820	To further investigate the role of @GENE$ , Hsu cells were transfected with a @GENE$ containing @GENE$ cloned under @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , infected with @DISEASE$ at 24 h post - transfection , and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi	1
7821	Real - time RT - qPCR showed increase@GENE$ V NS1 levels ( > 4 - fold ) in cells transfected@GENE$ xCul4 compared with empty vector ( Control ) , indicating increased viral replication ( Fig 3E )	1
7822	Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media also showed significantly increased viral titer ( > 10 - fold ) in cells over - expre@GENE$ xCul4 compared with control cells ( Fig 3F )	1
7823	In a parallel experiment , western blots @GENE$ ibody was performed on total cell lysates collected from Hsu cells transfected@GENE$ xCul4 to confirm exogenous expression lev@GENE$ xCul4 ( Fig 3G )	1
7824	Combined , the above data suggest@GENE$ xCul4 plays a significant pro - viral role during @DISEASE$ .	1
7825	Preparedness for a possible global pandemic caused by viruses such as the highly pathogenic influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority	1
7826	In particular , it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes	1
7827	Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor , analyze , and possibly predict the evolution of viruses	1
7828	However , in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for largescale phyloinformatics studies , a team of computer scientists , biostatisticians and virologists is needed - a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases	1
7829	Furthermore , the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms	1
7830	This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area .	1
7831	Occupations related to pigs , breeding pigs at home , exposures to pigs or pork with @DISEASE$ , eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the last 2 weeks and having ill pigs at home in the last 4 weeks were associated with @DISEASE$ , after adjustment for residency , age and sex ( Table 5 )	1
7832	@DISEASE$ infection was independently associated with occupations related to pigs , exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of @DISEASE$ in the 2 weeks prior to infection , and eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to infection after multivariate analysis	1
7833	These associations were found in comparisons of cases with the hospital control group as well as with the community control group	1
7834	Breeding pigs at home , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or exposure to pigs or pork without @DISEASE$ were not associated with @DISEASE$ in multivariate analysis ( Table 6 )	1
7835	In a sensitivity analysis , which included only male cases and controls , exactly the same risk factors were significant with similar odds ratios as in the main analysis	1
7836	Risk factors identified by multivariate analysis of male cases and controls from either control group included eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes ( OR 1 ' ' High risk ' ' dishes predominantly consisted of undercooked food ( Table 3 )	1
7837	Exposure to pigs or pork in the presence of @DISEASE$ , eating ' ' high risk ' ' dishes , or both , were reported in 72 / 101 S	1
7838	suis cases ( 71	1
7839	3 % ) , 91 / 303 hospital controls ( 30 % ) and 84 / 300 community controls ( 28 % )	1

7843	2 % ) and 29 community controls ( 9	1
7844	7 % ) , eating these ' ' high risk ' ' dishes was the only risk factor reported .	1
7845	Feed intake is usually reduced initially after weaning and the pig may develop @DISEASE$ of variable duration and extent between farms , depending on livestock management and the nature of the feed [ 36 ]	1
7846	Madec et al	1
7847	[ 30 ] reported that the low feed intake over the first week after weaning is strongly correlated with the risk of disease occurrence over the post - weaning period	1
7848	Underfeeding during weaning reduces growth performance of pigs , and contributes to @DISEASE$ and adversely affects villous height and crypt depth [ 3 ]	1
7849	This morphological disruption of the intestinal mucosa promotes the creation of an ideal environment for the multiplication of bacteria such as E	1
7850	coli and allows toxins and bacteria to cross the epithelium as a result of this inflammation [ 37 ] ( Fig	1

7857	Some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location	1
7858	Nonsense mutations generate defective @GENE$ that may or may not be functional	1
7859	Stop codon mutations were shown to be maintained within the @DISEASE$ populations , leading to altered viral fitness and thus influencing transmission dynamics [ 23 ]	1
7860	Likewise , it has been shown that human @DISEASE$ mutants lacking the G gene are still able@GENE$ m infectious particles in vitro [ 24 ]	1
7861	Across all samples and genome locations sequenced by Illumina , 5146 variants were detected at 2302 genomic locations , o@GENE$ f the 10451 positions sequenced	1
7862	The frequency of these variants range from extremely rare ( 0	1

7864	196 , 0006 , see Figure S1 ) to very common ( 38 % at Fx 40 genome location 1021 , measured at 32 % by 454 )	1
7865	The mean frequency of the variant pool is 0	1
7866	3 % , indicating that the bulk of the variants detected are ultra rare	1
7867	To examine where in the genome mutations are most likely to occur , only those mutations that occur at	1
7868	1 % in a sample or occur in multiple samples with a cumulative frequency	1
7869	1 % are retained for further analysis	1
7870	There are 248 loci with such high o@GENE$ ence / frequency variants ( ' ' one - percent variants ' ' , Figure S9 ) , their distribution across the coding and non - coding regions @GENE$ me ( Fi@GENE$  very similar to that of the 243 mutations occurring at the consensus level ( Figure S2 )	1
7871	In fact , 58 of these one - percent variants occur at loci with consensu@GENE$ evel mutations .	1
7872	The transformation is driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors including chemical agents that induce the activation of @GENE$ es	1
7873	Accumulating epidemiologic and clinical data provide a strong link between inflammation and @DISEASE$ initiation and progression [ 20 , 21 ] , but the molecular inflammatory determinants remain to be established	1
7874	COX - 2 derived PGE 2 is a proinflammatory bioactive lipid and is the major prostaglandin produced in many human @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] , stomach [ 23 ] , breast [ 24 ] and lung [ 25 ]	1
7875	PGE 2 and its receptors play an essential role in promoting @DISEASE$ progression	1
7876	For example , PGE 2 significantly enhanced carcinogen induced @DISEASE$ incidence and multiplicity in rats	1
7877	PGE 2 accelerates @DISEASE$ growth in Apc Min mice [ 26 ]	1
7878	However , the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear	1
7879	. Therefore , we will focus on PGE2 and its receptors and its downstream targets in human bronchial epithelial cells , and explore the potential mechanism	1
7880	This is the first study on the effects of PGE 2 in inducing the activation of cancerpromoting@GENE$ hial epithelial cells	1
7881	In concordance with studies performed in @DISEASE$ cells before , we demonstrate PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , through increased PDK1 gene e@GENE$ sion that is dependent on EP4 and ind@GENE$ on of c - Jun	1

7884	Activation of PDK1 has been shown to regula@GENE$ ll survival and growth , cell cycle progression , gene expression and differention [ 9 , 29 ]	1
7885	Autophosphorylation and growth - factorinduced phosphorylation in its activation loop is required for PDK1 activity [ 30 ]	1
7886	S241A mutation abolished PDK1 catalytic activity completely , which suggests phosphorylation at Ser - 241 is important for PDK1 signaling [ 31 ]	1
7887	There is increasing evidence that PDK1 is involved in cancer progression and invasion	1
7888	Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer has revealed that phosphorylation of PDK1 on Ser - 241 was strongly enhanced in 90 % of the samples tested [ 11 ]	1
7889	Immunohistochemical analysis using anti - phospho - Tyr - 9 antibodies demonstrated that the level of Tyr - 9 phosphorylation is increased markly in diseased lung , liver , colon , and breast tissue compared to normal tissue [ 12 ]	1
7890	Studies have shown that angiotension - II - induced focal adhesion formation is inhibited by infection with Adeno - PDK1 - Y9F via paxillin [ 10 ]	1
7891	This regulation of focal adhesion suggests that PDK1 participates in integrating signals that control cell growth , apoptosis and migration	1
7892	PDK1 gene has been assoiated with poor differentiation of late stage lung cancer [ 32 ]	1
7893	PDK1 was shown capable of augmenting tumorigenesis in tissues harboring ERBB2 amplifications [ 33 ] , PTEN deletions [ 34 ] , and mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PIK3CA ) [ 35 ]	1
7894	Inhibition of PDK1 is therefore expected to attenuate tumors associated with deregulated PIK3CA / PTEN signaling	1
7895	Indeed , hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 in Pten + / − mice delays the onset of tumorigenesis , and small molecule inhibitors of PDK1 inhibit tumor xenografts and lung colonization [ 36 ]	1
7896	Further , PDK1 inactivation effectively attenuated the development of Kras oncogene - driven pancreatic cancer , but not NSCLC , further supporting the importance of PDK1 in tumor development , albeit , in select cancer types [ 37 ]	1
7897	Here , we found that PGE2 increased the expression of PDK1 in bronchial epithelial cells	1
7898	Overexpression of PDK1 enhanced cell proliferation , while cells stimulated with PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA reduced cell growth	1
7899	These findings provides the first genetic evidence that PDK1 may also play an essential role in abnormally enhanced cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in bronchial epithelial cells , which was convinced in tumor cells in previous studies	1
7900	Consistent with former studies , PDK1 inactivations by small molecule inhibitor of PDK1 or siRNA effectively attenuated cell proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells , supporting the potential importance of PDK1 in NSCLC development	1
7901	PDK1 also plays a crucial role in metastasis	1
7902	This kinase mediates mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype , in part , by membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) induction , which in turn activates MMP - 2 and modulates the extracellular matrix proteins decorin and collagen [ 11 ]	1
7903	Knockdown of PDK1 inhibits spontaneous migration and epidermal - growth - factor - induced chemotaxis in breast cancer cells	1
7904	In severe combined immunodeficiency mice , PDK1 - depleted human breast cancer cells form tumors more slowly and are defective in extravasation to the lungs after intravenous injection [ 38 ]	1
7905	These results indicate that PDK1 plays an important role in regulating malignancy in breast cancer cells	1
7906	Moreover , reducing PDK1 expression in PTEN + / − mice protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors [ 36 ] , thereby providing genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia that result from loss of PTEN	1
7907	In addition , PDK1 is an upstream kinase of AKT , which regulates activities of AKT , in turn , mediates the regulation of tumor cell growth , metastasis , and angiogenesis [ 39 ]	1
7908	All these results validate PDK1 is a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors .	1
7909	Pathogenesis of porcine @DISEASE$ has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 7 , 40 , 57 ]	1
7910	Indeed , piglets ingest ETEC found in their environment , especially derived from mammary glands of their mother and from the farrowing room or from the pen environment on arrival in the nursery ( Fig	1
7911	2 )	1
7912	These ETEC originate from the gut of piglets with @DISEASE$ , or subclinical carrier animals at the farm [ 57 ]	1
7913	ETEC bacteria adhere to pig ' s small intestinal epithelium , causes an increase of water and electrolytes secretion into the intestinal lumen generated by the release of enterotoxins , an@GENE$ unctions of enterocytes by increasing secretion and reducing absorption [ 7 ]	1
7914	Excessive secretion of electrolytes and water leads to @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and possible death [ 28 , [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] ( Fig	1
7915	2 )	1
7916	It has been widely reported in the scientific literature that ETEC challenge in pigs was not associated with significant macroscopic lesions or morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa resulting from the toxic activity of ETEC enterotoxins [ 57 , 61 , 62 ] @GENE$ studies have reported that the necropsy of challenged pigs with ETEC or naturally infected animals , has revealed several lesions such as ; @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 57 , 63 ]	1
7917	Furthermore , @DISEASE$ in pigs may also result in a @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ]	1
7918	Moreover , @DISEASE$ in pigs might be associated with secondary @DISEASE$ [ 66 ] and inactivation of the hemolysin structural gene ( hlyA ) of an ETEC : F4 challenge strain did not decrease the incidence of this @DISEASE$ in orally challenged gnotobiotic piglets [ 66 ]	1
7919	Thus , macroscopic lesions of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ related to ETEC infection in the post weaning peri@GENE$ e @GENE$ quence of the rapid release of bacterial LPS from the pig ' s intestine into the systemic circulation [ 57 ]	1
7920	On the other hand , microscopically , ETEC challenge in pigs has been associated with a greater villous atrophy and a large crypt depth reduction in all segments of the intestine of challenged animals [ 67 ] .	1
7921	Principal component analysis was carried out to identify the codon usage bias among @GENE$	1
7922	From which we could detect one major trend in the Axis 1 which accounted for 20	1
7923	815 % of the total variation , and another major trend in the Axis 2 for 16	1
7924	273 % of the total variation	1
7925	A plot of the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ of each gene was shown in Additional file 1 , Figure S1	1
7926	Obviously , those polioviruses belong to the same genotype tends to come together ( except strain 48 , isolated from Finland )	1
7927	Compared with the scattered groups of polioviruses genotype 1 , genotype 2 and 3 strains aggregated more tightly to some degree	1
7928	Although this graph is a little complex , it seems that there is a clear geographical demarcation in the polioviruses genotype 1 such as the @DISEASE$ strains isolated from USA , Dominica , China mainland and Taiwan	1
7929	These may indicate that geographic is another factor on codon usage bias .	1
7930	Ethical Considerations This is a review paper	1
7931	No human subjects were involved in the study .	1
7932	Nurse ( N4 ) said : " We need infection control and prevention to be in place for our safety	1
7933	It is important that after having contact with patients we should wash our hands with soap	1

7943	Managements should appreciate @DISEASE$ nurses and acknowledge their services through accolades and incentives to boost their morale	1

7945	Usefulness of Cellular Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for Predicting the Etiology of @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ Patients	1
7946	Respiratory viruses , and especially RSV , are leading causes of hospitalization in infants and young children during the cold season in temperate climates [ 4 , 5 ]	1
7947	Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in @DISEASE$ and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged < 5 years also in developing countries [ 6 ]	1
7948	This was confirmed in a WHO - sponsored denominator - based study of RSV - associated @DISEASE$ in four developing countries [ 7 ]	1
7949	Moreover , while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe @DISEASE$ in otherwise healthy children in highincome countries [ 8 ] , little information on its epidemiology is available from resource - poor settings	1
7950	A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published , but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]	1
7951	Seasonality of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in tropical and sub - tropical regions differs from the well - defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates , and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [ 1 , 12 ]	1
7952	Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures , such as development and introduction of vaccines in low - and middle - income countries .	1
7953	Despite visually similar solutions , the @GENE$ best - fit and SEIR best - fit models ( Figure 3C ) result in strikingly different estimates of R 0 : 3	1
7954	74 for the @GENE$ model versus 35	1
7955	9 for the @GENE$ model , which is partly a result of the small population size	1
7956	However , the best - fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma - distributed @GENE$ model ( m ¼ 2 , n ¼ 2 ) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ) : the exponentially distributed @GENE$ model gives the same estimate whether the first six ( up to the peak in incidence ) or more points are used	1
7957	This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take - off ( k ¼ 1	1
7958	0837 d À1 ) , and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4	1
7959	For the @GENE$ model ( n ¼ 1 , 1 / c ¼ 2	1
7960	2 d ) we obtain an R 0 of 4	1
7961	38 whereas for the @GENE$ model ( m ¼ 2 , n ¼ 2 , 1 / r ¼ 2	1
7962	6 d , 1 / c ¼ 2	1
7963	1 d ) we obtain an R 0 of 16	1
7964	9	1
7965	Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed @GENE$ model but significantly less well for the gamma - distributed @GENE$ model	1
7966	Given that we are fitting an additional parameter , it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions	1
7967	However , this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period , estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .	1
7968	The Total cell count ( TCC ) in BAL - fluid was high ( median : 1055	1
7969	5 / mm 3 , IQR : 544	1
7970	5 / mm 3 - 2099	1
7971	75 / mm 3 ) and differential cytology revealed a @DISEASE$ in 24 of 28 ( 85	1
7972	7 % ) patients .	1
7973	The large discrepancies between estimates of R 0 from the exponentially distributed and gamma - distributed fits reiterate the importance of accurately determining the precise distributions of latent and infectious periods	1
7974	Although the data required for such a task are often available from post hoc analyses of epidemics they are certainly lacking for a novel emerging infection	1
7975	Instead , the uncertainty surrounding assumptions about the distributions should be incorporated into quantitative predictions made from epidemiological models , especially since this may well be greater than any uncertainty that arises from noise in the data	1
7976	Of course , more sophisticated fitting methods than those used in this paper exist [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] , but if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate , the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant .	1
7977	Aerobic bacteria were isolated as sole pathogen in 11 of 33 ( 33	1
7978	3 % ) cases	1
7979	Mixed @DISEASE$ and mixed @DISEASE$ infection were found in 4 of 33 ( 12	1
7980	1 % ) and in 1 of 33 ( 3	1
7981	0 % ) cases , respectively ( Table 2 ) .	1
7982	First , it is important to understand how @DISEASE$ has been socially constructed in Singapore and how power relations operate between the different stakeholders	1
7983	Wernli et al	1
7984	distinguished five different frames that map the global policy discourse on @DISEASE$ [ 26 ]	1
7985	These are : a One Health approach combining in one paradigm human , animal , and environment health ; a health security threat giving rise to the global health security agenda ; a healthcare policy issue with the dominance of the medical profession ; a development issue where it is considered that low - and - middle income countries drive @DISEASE$ ; and an innovation issue with a focus on new diagnostics and antibiotics	1
7986	Wernli et al	1
7987	also distinguish a set of actors and policies for each of the frames described	1
7988	In the Singaporean context , it is interesting to note that several frames coexist with their respective actors leading the selected frame	1
7989	First , it was reported that there is a One Health platform where all stakeholders meet	1
7990	Second , there is a strong healthcare policy frame as it was reported that Singapore ' s @DISEASE$ policies were largely driven by a group of @DISEASE$ clinicians	1
7991	Third , @DISEASE$ is also seen as an innovation issue where researchers are working to identify novel solutions on all fronts	1
7992	The results of this study suggest that a deeper understanding is needed of the different power relations between these distinct groups to ensure the successful implementation of policies designed to respond to the threat of resistance	1
7993	However , from our participants ' responses we can tentatively conclude that @DISEASE$ is predominantly seen as a biomedical problem within the context of healthcare facilities and within the pursuit of clinicians controlling @DISEASE$ even when they still participate in the One Health platform	1
7994	It could also be argued that historically the emphasis on @DISEASE$ has been biomedical because this is where the health burden was seen and therefore where the expertise developed	1
7995	This , however , does not mean that other areas are not seen as important .	1

7998	The use of restrictive measures such as quarantine draws into sharp relief the push and pull of opposing forces that characterize the dynamic interplay between the personal autonomy of the citizen on the one hand and the collective rights of the community on the other	1
7999	As Bensimon and Upshur [ 3 ] have argued , justification for quarantine cannot be founded upon scientific evidence alone ; rather , the decision to implement quarantine should be equally An emerging conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures Figure 1 An emerging conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures	1
8000	ii .	1
8001	In view of this inter - region variability , it is not surprising that the global community of public health experts is itself conflicted about the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures that impinge upon the intrinsic rights of individuals	1
8002	Those who favour the consideration of quarantine during @DISEASE$ outbreaks maintain that it is prudent public health policy [ 23 ] , whereas those in opposition argue that quarantine is inherently paternalistic and an unnecessary breach of basic human rights [ 24 ]	1
8003	Despite the difference of opinion , however , there does appear to be general agreement on this : " ultimately , public health must rely not on force but on persuasion , and not on blind trust but on trust based on transparency , accountability , democracy , and human rights " [ 24 ] .	1
8004	In conclusion , the DNA virus - protective effects conferred by the @GENE$ can be attributed to the @GENE$ activity of the protein in the nucleus and @GENE$ activity in the cytoplasm	1
8005	This antibody inhibits ( 1 ) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus by viral DNA degradation and ( 2 ) viral protein translation in the cytoplasm via viral RNA degradation	1
8006	In other words , the @GENE$ attacks the @GENE$ itself or its @GENE$ in two different subcellular spaces ( nucleus and cytoplasm ) and at two different times ( viral replication and viral transcription ) ( Figure 9 )	1
8007	These antiviral effects of @GENE$ have not only been observed against viruses with a @GENE$ but also ssRNA viruses such as CSFV [ 25 ] and several plant viruses such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 27 ]	1
8008	Taken together , 3D8 sc@GENE$ andidate antivi@GENE$ an potentially confer resistance to a broad spectrum of animal and plant viruses .	1
8009	After the antiviral effects of the @GENE$ was confirmed in HeLa cells , transformed mice harboring the @GENE$ were produced to investigate the antiviral effects in an in vivo mouse system	1
8010	The @GENE$ was linearized with @GENE$ and then used for transformation of C57BL / 6NCrjBgi	1
8011	A total of 150 F 0 were generated and 10 lines ( F 0 : 47 , 69 , 90 , 92 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 115 , 128 , and 135 ) out of 150 F 0 were selected by PCR analysis ( Figure S3A )	1
8012	Each transformant was reconfirmed by Southern hybridization after @GENE$ was digested by @GENE$ and @GENE$ enzymes	1
8013	All transformants showed single bands that reacted with the probes prepared with the @GENE$ ( Figure @GENE$ )	1
8014	@GENE$ expression levels were analyzed in the different transgenic lines and different organs	1
8015	The muscle , brain , and liver were chosen because these organs are virus infection routes and the relative @GENE$ expression levels were investigated by quantitative real - time RT - PCR ( Figure 7A )	1
8016	The F 0 69 , 90 , and 135 lines were selected from 10 F 0 lines for further analysis based on @GENE$ expression levels in the TG mice lines and previous therapeutics experiments , which showed that @DISEASE$ was detected in muscle and brains after mice were challenged with PR@GENE$ teins by intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections , respectively	1
8017	Therefore , the F 0 90 line , which expressed the hi@GENE$  scFv levels in both brain Wild - type HeLa , SCH07072 , and muSCH cells were infected with HSV : : GFV at an MOI of 0	1

8032	The F 0 69 line showed positive gPCR and RT - PCR results but 3D8 scFv expression levels in the F 0 69 line were low ; thus , it was used as a control .	1
8033	One study , reviewing 307 patients who underwent LT for @DISEASE$ over a 10 - year period , suggested that advanced donor age , prolonged donor hospitalization , increasing recipient age , and elevated recipient MELD scores were found to increase the relative risk of @DISEASE$ recurrence [ 9 ]	1
8034	Moreover , earlier studies have advocated that @DISEASE$ recurrence may be more severe when older donors are used [ 10 , 11 ]	1
8035	In addition , the type of donor used may have an impact on HCV reinfection of the graft after LT	1
8036	One clinical observation suggested that @DISEASE$ recurrence is more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT [ 12 ]	1
8037	However , another study reported that there are no differences observed in @DISEASE$ recurrence rate , severity of intrahepatic pathology , or graft and patient survival between living donor LT and cadaveric LT recipients [ 13 ]	1
8038	As to the source of HCV reinfection in the allograft , it may occur at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ]	1
8039	The blood itself has a high probability to be the origin of this allograft reinfection [ 4 ]	1
8040	It is indeed valuable that identifying these risk factors before LT , particularly when matching donors to @DISEASE$ recipients , may decrease the incidence of @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT .	1
8041	The distribution of cases varied with month of presentation and is shown in Figure 3	1
8042	Frequent transfer of cats in Victoria between shelters in Mildura ( Outbreak 2 site ) and Melbourne ( Outbreak 1 site ) suggested direct spread of the infection between these regions	1
8043	Cats from two private shelters in Mildura were transported for rehoming to a shelter in Melbourne in 2014 and 2015 .	1
8044	contain @GENE$ whereas 15 , 460 contain @GENE$	1
8045	6247 proteins contain both @GENE$ and @GENE$ whereas 129 proteins contain only @GENE$ ( without containing WxxL patterns ) and 9213 proteins contain only @GENE$ ( without xLIR patterns ) ( Table S1 )	1
8046	We found a correlation between the total number of putative @GENE$ identified in a family and number of sequences ( Fig	1
8047	2A )	1
8048	On average , we found 8	1
8049	3 @GENE$ per sequence	1
8050	The fact that viral sequences often refer to @GENE$ instead of individual proteins is possibly an explanation of the high proportion of patterns identified .	1
8051	Protein quantification software , based on the relative content of the isotopic reporter group and using m / z 114 as a reference , showed significant results ( P ≤ 0	1
8052	05 )	1
8053	Some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group , giving no quantification information	1
8054	The specific information and re - identification will be published in a future study	1
8055	The 16 proteins that were identified using @GENE$ were classified into six categories , based on protein function ( Fig	1
8056	1 )	1
8057	The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with @DISEASE$ were verified using western blotting : CRP p@GENE$ og@GENE$ li@GENE$ te@GENE$ N ( @GENE$ 	1
8058	2 and Table IV )	1
8059	Two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes ( apoli@GENE$ late@GENE$ 	1
8060	Ongoing studies are exploring heavy and light chain usage in B cells and PBs during @DISEASE$ with next generation sequencing techniques	1
8061	To specifically target an etiology , we have c@GENE$ bodies with pairing @GENE$ chains utilizing the 10x Genomics ® Single Cell sequencing technology [ 150 ]	1
8062	As an example , from the PB rise of near 11 % of circulating B cells seen in subject 24 , we created a panel of 946 @GENE$ uences	1
8063	From this sample , there are a number of clones with exact sequence repeats ( roughly 5 % )	1
8064	To assign clonal groups , we analyzed the sequences@GENE$ g CDR3 length and sequences , and compared pre@GENE$ uences ( from IMGT , [ 151 ] )	1
8065	Roughly 40 % of clones can be assigned to have clonal relationships	1
8066	Several @GENE$ bodies we generated are presented in Table 2	1
8067	We chose these fifteen antibodies to highlight markers that show somatic hypermutation and clonal expansion	1
8068	These are highlighted by predicted clonal members , isotype switching , nucleotide substitutions from pre@GENE$ mlines , and increases in the subgroup replacement to silent nucleotide mutation ( R / S ) ratios	1
8069	Elevation of this ratio supports clonal select@GENE$ bodies which would correlate with an increase in mutations leading to changes in the amino acids , particularly @GENE$ eg@GENE$ ( CDRs ) [ 152 ]	1
8070	Work on identifying the protein targets of these antibodies is ongoing	1
8071	Because of the characteristics seen in these antibodies , we hypothesize these antibodies target the etiology that caused @DISEASE$ in this child .	1
8072	To determine whether @GENE$ antagonism impacts survival from @DISEASE$ , mice were fed PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , then infected with @DISEASE$ [ 42 ] at either 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad ( f	1
8073	p	1
8074	) inoculation	1
8075	Consistent with published data [ 8 , 49 ] , 30 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 4 PFU and 90 % of control - treated mice survived infection with 10 2 PFU ; however , mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer ( Fig	1
8076	2a )	1
8077	This was associated with significantly increased @DISEASE$ loss ( Fig	1
8078	2b ) and more severe clinical score ( Fig	1
8079	2c , d ) in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU WNV - NY .	1
8080	Specimens positive for HAdV were further tested for co - infection with other respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR and multiple reverse transcription PCR ( RT - PCR ) , including @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , @DISEASE$ ( PIC ) including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , 2 and 3 , human @DISEASE$ ( HBoV ) , human @DISEASE$ ( hMPV ) , and human coronavirus ( HCoV ) , including HCoV - OC43 , HCoV - 229E , HCoV - NL63 , and HCoV - HKU1 , as previously described [ 24 , 25 ] .	1
8081	@GENE$ and bacterial strains	1
8082	The @GENE$ carrying full - length coding sequences of HCV was a generous gift from Professor Charles M	1
8083	Rice from the Center for the Study of @DISEASE$ , Rockefeller University , New York , NY , USA	1
8084	The Escherichia coli ( E	1
8085	coli ) strains , Jm109 , DH5a and BL21 ( DE3 ) , were used as the cloning and expression hosts .	1
8086	Subconfluent cultures of @DISEASE$ cells were synchronized in G0 / G1 phase by serum deprivation ( He et al	1
8087	, 2010 )	1
8088	Approximately 5 × 10 5 cells were plated in a 6 - well plate and maintained in serumfree medium for 24 h	1
8089	After EV - D68 virus infection , fresh 10 % DMEM was added to release the cells from G0 / G1 .	1
8090	Spillover events are complex and usually require successful alignment of several contributing factors [ 47 ]	1
8091	One such critical factor is increased shedding of virus by bats	1
8092	This factor is influenced by the host response and virus replication	1
8093	Plowright et al	1
8094	[ 47 ] proposed a hypothesis which states that viruses infect naïve susceptible bats leading to acute infection	1
8095	This subsequently progresses to a chronic or latent infection	1
8096	The virus then reactivates from time to time in response to a variety of physiological and environmental triggers	1
8097	This hypothesis is called the SILI hypothesis : Susceptible - Infectious - Latent - Infectious [ 47 ]	1
8098	As described above , the bat immune system is unique and virus infection probably persists in many bats .	1
8099	We now propose a simple stochastic model for an @DISEASE$ outbreak , based on the work of Buckeridge , et al	1
8100	and Brookmeyer et al	1
8101	[ 16 , 17 ]	1
8102	As proposed by these authors , our model incorporates two elements : Any @DISEASE$ outbreak starts with the dispersion of the @DISEASE$ spores	1
8103	Once spores are inhaled by a subject , in the incubation stage spores either germinate or are cleared out the lung	1
8104	For the spores that germinate during incubation , the later stages of the disease are the prodromal and fulminant stages , followed by death	1
8105	Buckeridge , et al	1
8106	[ 16 ] model the spread of spores over a grid covering the Norfolk , Virginia region using a Gaussian plume model	1
8107	Their model considers the source and Time series plots strength of the @DISEASE$ attack , along with prevalent wind directions .	1
8108	The etiology of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , the leading cause of @DISEASE$ in children , is currently unknown	1
8109	Epidemiology supports a relationship of @DISEASE$ to an @DISEASE$	1
8110	Several pathological mechanisms are being considered , including a superantigen response , direct invasion by an infectious etiology or an autoimmune phenomenon	1
8111	Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin is effective at reducing the rates of @DISEASE$	1
8112	However , the role of B cells and antibodies in @DISEASE$ @GENE$ s remains unclear	1
8113	Murine models are not clear on the role for B cells and antibodies in pat@GENE$  Studies on rare @DISEASE$ specimens reveal plasma cell infiltrates	1
8114	Antibodies generated from these aneurysmal plasma cell infiltrates showed cross - reaction to intracellular inclusions in the bronchial epithelium of a number of pathologic specimens from children with @DISEASE$	1
8115	These antibodies have not defined an etiology	1
8116	Notably , a number of autoantib@GENE$  have been reported in children with @DISEASE$	1
8117	Recent studies show acute B cell responses are similar in children with @DISEASE$ compared to children with infections , lending further support of an @DISEASE$ disease cause of @DISEASE$	1
8118	Here , we will review and discuss the inconsistencies in the literature in relation to B cell r@GENE$ antibodies , and a potential role for humoral immunity in @DISEASE$ pathogenesis or diagnosis .	1
8119	Viruses 2015 , 7 7 were generated and transduced into PK - 15 cells , resulting in efficient knockdown of the @GENE$ expression ( Figure 4A )	1
8120	Twenty - four hours after lentivirus - mediated @GENE$ transduction , PK - 15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0	1
8121	1	1
8122	The viral replication was analyzed by real - time RT - PCR , virus titration and Western blotting	1
8123	In comparison with the shNC control , the @GENE$ copies in the @GENE$ - knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A )	1
8124	Similarly , the CSFV titers were significantly increased after @GENE$ knockdown in PK - 15 cells ( Figure 4B ) , and the @GENE$ expression in the sheEF1A - transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C )	1
8125	The results indicate that the @GENE$ negatively modulates the CSFV replication .	1
8126	BMC Public Health Public perceptions of quarantine : community - based telephone survey following an @DISEASE$ outbreak	1
8127	Subsequently , we checked whether @GENE$ interfered with the assembly of @GENE$ ubiquitination machinery	1
8128	Expression of @GENE$ protein inhibited the association of @GENE$ with @GENE$ ( Figure 3B Since the presence of @GENE$ could inhibit @GENE$ association with full - length @GENE$ but not with @GENE$ , we postulated that the @GENE$ either interacts with @GENE$ and sequesters it away from @GENE$ or interacts with other subunits of the @GENE$ thereby modulating @GENE$ binding to @GENE$	1
8129	Alternatively , it binds to @GENE$ itself and blocks the formation of the @GENE$	1
8130	We thus checked the association of @GENE$ with the above components	1
8131	No interaction was detected between @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Figure 3C , lane 6 ) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay	1
8132	The possibility that @GENE$ over - expression might be promoting @GENE$ association with @GENE$ was ruled out by testing @GENE$ and @GENE$ association in full - length or ΔF - @GENE$ overexpressing cells ( Figure 3D , lane 7 and 8 )	1

8134	Subsequently , we checked whether @GENE$ interacts with @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
8135	The @GENE$ protein did not associate with either @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( Figure 3D , lane 1 and 2 ) under conditions , where @GENE$ associated with these proteins ( lane 3 ) .	1

8141	The earlier studies on the germicidal efficacy of far UVC light 13 , 15 - 18 were performed exposing bacteria irradiated on a surface or in suspension	1
8142	In that a major pathway for the spread of @DISEASE$ is aerosol transmission 3 , we investigate for the first time the efficacy of far - UVC 222 - nm light for inactivating airborne viruses carried by aerosols - with the goal of providing a potentially safe alternative to conventional 254 - nm germicidal lamps to inactivate airborne microbes .	1
8143	All of the birds shed virus RNA at the level of the trachea on day 2 pi , confirming that the challenge caused an infection	1
8144	We did not detect @GENE$ in either the clarified - and - ultracentrifuged plasma or the pelleted blood cells .	1
8145	Lactate dehydrogenase - elevating virus ( LDV ) is a small , positive sense , single stranded RNA virus of the Arteriviridae family , related to @DISEASE$ such as the severe @DISEASE$ [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]	1
8146	It is a natural infectious agent of mice that causes very rapid lytic infections generally restricted to a minor subset of non - essential macrophages involved in scavenging extracellular lactate dehydrogenase @GENE$ ubset results in the elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels for whi@GENE$ [ 7 ]	1
8147	Virus titers peak within the first day of infection as susceptible target cells are depleted , and then the infection is maintained at a much lower chronic level dependent on the replenishment of new macrophage targets [ 8 ]	1
8148	LDV establishes chronic infections regardless of mouse strain , age , sex or immune - status [ 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]	1
8149	No clinical signs are typically associated with @DISEASE$ infections , although co - infection with retroviruses can lead to @DISEASE$ under certain circumstances [ 11 , 12 ] , and mice infected with @DISEASE$ have suppressed immune responses [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ]	1
8150	We recently found that acute infection with LDV induced a state of partial and transient activation in the vast majority of splenic lymphocytes	1
8151	Activation was characterized by high surface expression of the very early activation marker CD69 [ 1@GENE$ is the @GENE$  surface @GENE$ r known to be upregulated during the activation of lymphocytes and has recently been shown to interact with S1P1 to inhibit the egress@GENE$ ymphocytes from lymphoid tissues [ 17 ]	1

8153	In the filtration scenario the health benefits are due to filtration of the outdoor pollutants and also effective dilution of the indoor pollutants as the health - based optimal ventilation levels are higher .	1
8154	The projected health benefits can be achieved if the controls on ventilation and sources are fully implemented as defined in the scenario descriptions	1

8166	The between - day analyses were carried out by injecting the standard working solutions once per day for five consecutive days while the withinday analyses were done by injecting the standard working solutions five times on the same day	1
8167	A separate standard curve was constructed on each day of the validation study .	1
8168	by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C )	1
8169	We observed that compared to wildtype virus , all mutants exhibited higher replication , and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance	1
8170	Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication ; however , this difference was not statistically significant .	1
8171	To determine the extent of this phenotype , @GENE$ were tested according to the same experimental approach described above using : HIV - 1 vectors pseudotyped with the @DISEASE$ virus envelope ( GALV ) and with the @DISEASE$ virus RD114 envelope ( RD - TR , contai@GENE$  cytoplasmic tail@GENE$ tropic envelope for efficient pseudotyping of lentiviral particles , as described in [ 29 ] , Figure 1D ) , or vectors derived from different GFP - coding retroviruses ( @DISEASE$ , SIV MAC ; @DISEASE$ , MLV ) along with HIV - 1 , all pseudotyped with the pantropic Envelope VSVg ( Figure 1E )	1
8172	After vi@GENE$ malization , viral particles were used to challenge HEK293T cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards	1
8173	Under these conditions , viruses produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity that ranged@GENE$ 0 % in the case of SIV MAC - VSVg to 40 % in the case of HIV - 1 - GALV or HIV - 1 - RD - TR	1
8174	IFITM3 seemed to exert a lower effect on the inf@GENE$ y of MLV - VSVg in comparison with IFITM1 and − 2 , yet this defect was clearly det@GENE$  and@GENE$ tistically significant	1
8175	Overall , these results indicate that the expression of IFITMs during the phase of viral particles produ@GENE$ mpairs the infectivity of the retroviruses tested here .	1
8176	Polyamines play several roles in the eukaryotic cell and likely affect virus replication at several stages	1
8177	By isolating DFMO escape mutants , we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which	1
8178	Pausing	1
8179	Ribosome pausing at @GENE$ of @GENE$ EASE$ has been widely documented and may play a mechanistic role ( 2 )	1
8180	We tested whethe@GENE$ mplex could also induce pausing by clonin@GENE$ ignal ( with a defe@GENE$ uence ) in - frame wit@GENE$  gene and transl@GENE$ mRNAs in the WG system	1
8181	The extent of pausing was estimated by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at a @GENE$ mplex with that of the full - length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine , a potent inhibitor of initiation , 5 min after the start of the reaction	1
8182	A co@GENE$  mRNA was prepared@GENE$ plate linearized at the position of the ins@GENE$ ignal to serve as a pause marker	1
8183	As can be seen in Figure 7 , pausing was clearly evident in the presen@GENE$ PCBP2 , but far less so with either protein alone , or @GENE$  mRNA lackin@GENE$ egion	1
8184	The appearance o@GENE$ oduct was transient ( albeit visible over several minutes ) , consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather t@GENE$ oduct	1
8185	In Figure 7C , further pausing assays were carried out to examine the activity o@GENE$ tants ( in the presen@GENE$ [UNK] )	1
8186	We found a positive correlation between the extent of pausing observed and the activity of the three mutants in specific RNA binding , namely a littl@GENE$  KH1m , close to WT level@GENE$  KH2m and much less pausin@GENE$  KH3m .	1
8187	Our description of a role for @GENE$ in ribosomal frameshifting adds to a growing number of examples of viral subversion of @GENE$ function	1
8188	In the best characterized system , poliovirus , the capacity of @GENE$ to associate at two discrete @GENE$ locations and in concert with different protein partners is critical to almost all aspects of the virus replication cycle ( reviewed in Ref	1
8189	57 )	1
8190	Whether such complex regulatory circuits operate during PRRSV replication and transcription remains to be determined	1
8191	@GENE$ has been shown to associate with the @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation ( 34 , 35 )	1
8192	Furthermore , the relative abundance and location@GENE$ BPs in the cytoplasm of infected cells could be important in determining the precise ratio of non - frameshifte@GENE$ sp2 ) and trans - frame ( nsp2T@GENE$ cts at various stages of the replication cycle .	1
8193	We have shown previously that the @GENE$ has @GENE$ activity that non - specifically degrades in vitro DNA and RNA substrates [ 23 ]	1
8194	@GENE$ originated from MRL mice and is a @GENE$ linked to @GENE$ and @GENE$ by linker peptides [ 14 ]	1
8195	@GENE$ has catalytic activity supporting the hydrolysis of both single stranded and double stranded DNAs in the presence of Mg 2 + without significant sequence specificity	1
8196	In addition , efficient degradation of @GENE$ by @GENE$ in the presence of EDTA demonstrates that @GENE$ does not need divalent metal ions for its @GENE$ activity [ 23 ]	1
8197	Additionally , @GENE$ has @GENE$ and @GENE$ activity but when the @GENE$ of each @GENE$ and @GENE$ are changed from histidine ( 35 position in @GENE$ and 94 position in VL ) to alanine , respectively , by site - directed mutagenesis , the mutant @GENE$ loses @GENE$ activity but retains @GENE$ activity [ 24 ]	1
8198	We previously showed that @GENE$ can be applied to protect PK15 cells from @DISEASE$ infection	1

8200	Also , we previously found that progenies of the transgenic tobacco plant acquired complete resistances against two single stranded ( ss ) - DNA geminiviruses , four ssRNA tobamoviruses , and one ssRNA cucumovirus [ 26 , 27 ]	1

8203	The paper is based on a review of the peer - reviewed published medical , social , and political literature , which was accessed using four electronic databases - PubMed , Sociological Abstracts , Scholars Portal , and Web of Science	1
8204	The search was limited to full text articles published between 2002 and 2017 .	1
8205	Together , our data indicate that pDC ' s activated in a @GENE$ manner are primarily responsible for the rapid systemic @GENE$ response following infection of mice with @DISEASE$	1
8206	Furthermore @GENE$ feron response was most likely responsible for the transient expression of the@GENE$ arker on lymphocytes during @DISEASE$	1
8207	IFNa@GENE$ pendent , partial activation of lymphocytes has also been reported during acute infection with @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] , human @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 32 ] in mice	1
8208	However , not all @DISEASE$ induce partial activation , as it does not occur in @DISEASE$ of mice [ 16 ]	1
8209	Such broad activation is by definition non - specific , and leaves open the question of how it benefits the host	1
8210	Alsharifi et al	1
8211	have proposed that IFNa - induced partial activation may promote adaptive immune response@GENE$ lowering the threshold for full activation once antigen - specific recognition occurs [ 33 ]	1
8212	If so , IFNa may be a very important regulatory link between the innate and ad@GENE$ e immune responses	1
8213	Based on the findings that CD69 acts downstream of IFNa to inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoi@GENE$ ans [ 17 ] , it is @GENE$ likely that CD69 expression facilitates sustained contacts between lymphocytes and@GENE$ gen presenting cells during inflammatory responses , thereby enhancing full activation of antigen - specific lymphocytes	1

8315	Following the recent work of Hajiaghayi et al	1
8316	[ 58 ] , we use a two sided permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between two methods	1

8321	Then we combine the two sets @GENE$ A and @GENE$ and record the difference in sample means for 10 4 randomly chosen ways of choosing two sets with the same size as | @GENE$ | and | @GENE$ | from the combined set	1
8322	The p - value is the proportion of the sampled permutations where the absolute difference was greater than or equal to that of absolute difference of the means of sets @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
8323	Then , if the p - value of this test is less than the 5 % significance level , we reject the null hypothesis that methods A and B have equal accuracy and thus accept the alternative hypothesis that the difference in accuracy of method A and B is significant	1
8324	Otherwise , we cannot reject the null hypothesis	1

8330	We refer to this data set as " DK - pk16 " .	1
8331	Chest radiographs ( X - rays ) , because they are readily available and are generally ordered by clinicians to evaluate @DISEASE$ that are atypical or severe , have the potential to act as such a bio - monitoring and validation tool	1
8332	In addition , detection based on models of radiograph ordering can indicate when in - depth follow - up is needed , as may occur when ordering of radiographs by clinicians is excessive for a given time of the year	1
8333	Such indepth review of radiographs may confirm clinical suspicions of an emerging epidemic or signal the need to perform a targeted review of medical charts to identify anomalous findings or groupings of aberrant findings that might herald the early stages of a @DISEASE$ .	1

8366	Background	1
8367	@DISEASE$ exacerbations are a common reason for Emergency Department ( ED ) visits in children	1
8368	Aim	1
8369	To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations	1
8370	Methods	1
8371	We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for @DISEASE$ in 2016 in our Pediatric ED	1
8372	Results	1
8373	Visits for @DISEASE$ were 603 / 23197 ( 2	1
8374	6 % )	1
8375	76 % of the patients were < 6 years old and 24 % ≥ 6	1
8376	Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups ; 33 % of the school - aged children had a triggering @DISEASE$ condition ( versus 3 % in < 6 years ; <	1
8377	01 )	1
8378	191 patients had a previous history of @DISEASE$ ; among them , 95 were ≥ 6 years , 67 % of whom were not using any controller medication , showing a higher risk of a moderate - to - severe exacerbation than those under long - term therapy ( <	1
8379	01 )	1
8380	Exacerbations peaked in autumn and winter in preschoolers and in spring and early autumn in the school - aged children .	1
8381	Production of 3D8 scFv transgenic ( TG ) mice @GENE$ transgenic mice were produced by Macrogen Co	1
8382	using standard microinjection procedures	1
8383	Briefly , fertilized mouse eggs were flushed from the oviducts of superovulated C57BL / 6NCrjBgi mice , and male pronuclei were injected with a 2	1
8384	6 kb fragment ( 4 ng / ml ) of @GENE$ that had been obtained by digesting the @GENE$ with @GENE$	1
8385	The injected eggs were reimplanted in the oviducts of pseudo - pregnant C57BL / 6NCrjBgi recipient females	1
8386	At 3 weeks of age , the animals were tested for the presence of the transgene by PCR analysis of their @GENE$ using forward ( 59 CAGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAG 39 ) and reverse primers ( 59 CTGTTGAACAGACTCTGACTG 39 )	1
8387	The @GENE$ TG founders ( F 0 lines ) were mated with wild - type C57BL / 6NCrjBgi mice to establish the transgenic lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines in a breeding program provided by Macrogen Co	1
8388	The principles of laboratory animal care ( NIH publication 85 - 23 , revised 1986 ) were followed and all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the NVRQS , Korea .	1
8389	Results : The baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups , although the IVIG group showed a significantly reduced oxygenation index compared to the control group	1
8390	We found no differences in the length of ICU stay or ventilation parameters	1
8391	We did not find a significant difference between the groups for the extent of inflammation or for overall survival .	1
8392	Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world , with a under - five year mortality rate of 123 per 1 , 000 live births in 2013 according to the UN Inter - agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation	1
8393	It has been estimated that among its 14	1
8394	9 million inhabitants , each year more than 900 , 000 @DISEASE$ episodes occur in children under 5 years of age , leading to almost 8 , 000 deaths annually [ 7 ]	1
8395	A previous descriptive study reported that @DISEASE$ was the most frequent cause of admission , representing 18 % of total hospital admissions [ 8 ]	1
8396	However , detailed information was not available on clinical presentation and on the etiology of suspected @DISEASE$ cases [ 8 ]	1
8397	Moreover , no control group was included	1
8398	The presence of a control group of children without @DISEASE$ would allow better interpretation of microbiological findings , particularly with nasal sampling [ 9 ]	1
8399	In March 2011 , Mali included pneumococcal vaccination ( PCV13 ) in a routine immunization program ; but vaccine coverage is still low [ 10 ] .	1
8400	Although the impact of the host microbiota on @DISEASE$ is an important consideration ( reviewed by Wilks et al	1
8401	[ 78 ] ) , the majority of in vivo experiments pertaining to virus - bacterial interactions in the URT focus on the role of viruses on the host microbiota	1
8402	The results of these studies suggest that viruses can alter carriage structure by promoting the colonization of certain commensals	1
8403	In both animal models and human adults , infection with @DISEASE$ virus showed increased colonization by S	1
8404	pneumoniae and H	1
8405	influenzae in the URT [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]	1
8406	Similarly , infecting rats and chinchillas with @DISEASE$ led to increased colonization by nontypeable H	1
8407	influenzae [ 84 , 85 ]	1
8408	Collectively , epidemiologic studies and laboratory experiments suggest that the introduction of a virus to the URT niche can substantially alter the bacterial community present [ 26 ] .	1
8409	Cell - Penetrating Peptides for Antiviral Drug Development	1
8410	Non - specific binding was not evident ( using agarose gel electrophoresis of @GENE$ ) in samples assayed in uniplex , duplex or triplex analyses	1
8411	That all assays amplified the correct target region was confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( Online Resource S7 , Fig	1
8412	S7	1
8413	2 - S7	1
8414	7 )	1
8415	The assays appear specific to the intended squirrel pathogens , as neither SQPV nor SADV qPCR assays amplified ( 0 / 6 reactions ) a product in qPCRs seeded with either @GENE$ E$ , @DISEASE$ or canine adenovirus 1 or 2 DNA .	1
8416	Novel cases of @DISEASE$ are reported in this study also	1
8417	All three red squirrels that had died from causes other than @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or road causalities showed evidence of @DISEASE$ infection	1
8418	The two squirrels with severe @DISEASE$ had @DISEASE$ consistently identified in multiple tissue types , albeit at relatively low levels	1
8419	The cause of death of these two squirrels was thought to be due to @DISEASE$ , It should be noted that the swab / blood samples appear to be superior to tissue samples in all instances apart from adenovirus in red squirrels when using the qPCR developed in this study secondary to parasitism ( Duff et al	1
8420	2010 ; Larose et al	1
8421	2010 ; Simpson et al	1
8422	2013b )	1
8423	However , @DISEASE$ has been reported in 70 % ( 7 / 10 ) of case studies of @DISEASE$ ( Martinez - Jimenez et al	1
8424	2011 )	1
8425	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ in lice found on infected individuals was 80 % ( 4 / 5 : 95 % CI , 30 - 99 % ) , which combined with the relatively high occurrence of viral@GENE$ ood ( 67 % ( 6 / 9 ) ; 95 % CI 31 - 91 % ) may suggest a potential role of the parasite in pathogen transmission	1
8426	Additionally , the red squirrel that had @DISEASE$ also showed SADV DNA presence in all tissues analysed	1
8427	The lung RQ value was the highest recorded in any infected individual ( 12	1
8428	52 ) , and , indeed , viral prevalence in lung tissue was relatively common in infected individuals ( 64 % , 7 / 11 ; 95 % CI , 32 - 88 % ) ( Fig	1
8429	3 ) .	1
8430	Once an alignment for each of the eight sections of the @GENE$ was completed , we used another Perl program to scan through the alignment and compare each sequence to a reference strain	1
8431	Point mutations were counted individually while indels , irrespective of size , were counted as a single change [ 44 ]	1
8432	There are several different ways to calculate sequence differences ( discussed in [ 50 ] ) , but this simple measure is sufficient for the purposes of this paper	1
8433	Due to variations in technique among the various studies that produced these sequences , the ends of the alignment tended to be ragged	1
8434	For this reason , we compared only the section of complete alignment between each sequence and the @GENE$	1
8435	The few internal reassortments [ 32 ] that have occurred in H1N1 were easily seen in the alignments , but these also made up a small fraction of all sites	1
8436	We did our best to create a consistent alignment through these regions .	1
8437	Taken together , @GENE$ has been shown to be an @GENE$ that strongly inhibits @DISEASE$ in vivo and in vitro	1
8438	This strong antiviral effect on TBEV is mediated by targeting the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle	1
8439	Interestingly , viperin targetin@GENE$ nthesis of plus - sense RNA@GENE$ the SAM domain or th@GENE$ nal dom@GENE$ terminal dom@GENE$ spo@GENE$ or interfering with virus assembly and release .	1
8440	Taken together , studies so far have demonstrated the importance of the @GENE$ - I - like - @GENE$ pathway in @DISEASE$ , whereas the role of the TLR pathways remains unclear .	1
8441	Pathogens that were identified in 47 patients are summarized in Table 2	1
8442	Twenty - eight bacterial pathogens were identified in 24 patients	1
8443	In 4 patients , two different bacteria were identified	1
8444	Staphylococcus aureus ( n = 5 ) was the most common bacteria , followed by Legionella pneumophila ( n = 4 ) , and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 3 )	1
8445	Bacteria were identified from BAL fluid cultures or PCRs in 15 patients , from endotracheal aspirates or sputum cultures in 15 patients , from blood cultures in 4 patients , and from urinary antigen tests in 4 patients ( two patients with @GENE$  two patients with @DI@GENE$ Eleven patients had two or more positive tests	1
8446	Twenty - six viruses were identified in 23 patients	1
8447	In three patients , two different viruses were identified	1
8448	Rhinovirus was the most common virus ( n = 11 ) , followed by @DISEASE$ ( n = 6 ) , and @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 )	1
8449	Viruses were identified from BAL fluid specimens in 18 patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 13 patients	1
8450	Viruses were detected in both in BAL fluid and nasopharyngeal samples in 8 patients .	1
8451	Post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) of proteins regulate a wide variety of cellular processes , including several aspects of innate immunity against pathogens	1
8452	As a result , pathogens have evolved mechanisms to block , reverse or usurp this machinery in order to successfully replicate within their hosts [ 1 ]	1
8453	For example , numerous viruses subvert the dynamics of phosphorylation , employing kinases , substrate mimics and @GENE$ to disrupt host signaling [ 1 ]	1
8454	Likewise , addition and removal of acetyl groups by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) can have a dramatic effect on viruses such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
8455	In response , several viral classes encode proteins to specifically disrupt host phosphorylation and acetylation [ 2 ]	1
8456	Beyond small - molecule PTMs , conjugation and cleavage of ubiquitin @GENE$ tin - like molecules has emerged as an important point of cellular regulation that several viruses target or subvert in order to replicate [ 3 ] .	1
8457	Identifiers ( ID ) composed of alphanumeric and other symbols are commonly used for tagging protein and @GENE$ and associated annotation in Gen - Bank [ 1 ] , UniProt [ 2 ] , and other sources that either use these sequences or deal with molecular properties of associated biological entities ( Table 1 )	1
8458	For instance in Uni - Prot , the @GENE$ is the sole @GENE$	1
8459	In GenBank three fields , locus , accession and version , carry four different IDs , but only gi number ( known also as primary ID ) and accession number combined with version form @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
8460	Each @GENE$ is assigned to a single entry	1
8461	In contrast , a particular non - unique ID may be found in numerous entries	1
8462	The @GENE$ ensure efficient computer - mediated data storage , maintenance and processing	1
8463	To facilitate data mapping and transfer between different databases , in which ID inter - conversion plays important part , several specialized resources including GoMiner [ 3 ] , ErmineJ [ 4 ] , SOURCE [ 5 ] , RESOURCERER [ 6 ] ; IDconverter and IDClight [ 7 ] , and DAVID [ 8 ] have been developed .	1
8464	The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in @GENE$ levels in the progression of @DISEASE$ using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) analysis , in addition to comparing the se@GENE$ vels of patients with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , patients with @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ - induced ACLF ) and normal individuals	1
8465	Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ	1
8466	The study population included healthy controls ( n = 5 ) , patients with @DISEASE$ ( n = 5 ) and patients with @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( n = 5 )	1
8467	Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls , patients with @DISEASE$ and patients with @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 , respectively )	1
8468	Using@GENE$  analysis , 16 different@GENE$  with ≥ 1	1
8469	5 - fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ compared with the healthy controls	1
8470	Five of those@GENE$ n precursor , hemoglobin β ch@GENE$ Hb@GENE$ J @GENE$ 4 pr@GENE$ vitronectin , which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with @DISEASE$ , were subsequently verified using western blotting	1
8471	The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ	1
8472	Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process , and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV - induced @DISEASE$ remain unclear	1
8473	This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression@GENE$ um proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist	1
8474	The analysis of a larger number of samples is required to identify potential protein biomarkers that may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of @DISEASE$ .	1
8475	The seropositive rate using ELISA was 1	1

8477	33 % ( 1 of 307 ) in healthcare workers , and 0	1

8486	@DISEASE$ affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide , resulting in a devastating toll on human health and socio - economic development	1
8487	Along with the emergence of newly - recognized human pathogens ( the SARS coronavirus , the recent influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 ) , the ever - increasing incidence of @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ continues to increase OPEN ACCESS the global burden of @DISEASE$ [ 1 , 2 ]	1
8488	Vaccines have been developed for some of the most important viral pathogens	1
8489	Although vaccines against @DISEASE$ [ 3 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 4 ] are in clinical phases III and II respectively , there is still little prospect of effective vaccines against these agents	1
8490	There are enormous challenges to the development of these vaccines , especially since millions of people are already chronically infected with these viruses , which would require therapeutic vaccines for control .	1
8491	Interestingly , Huo et al	1
8492	( 2015 ) showed that knock - down of @GENE$ has a greater effect on reducing surface @GENE$ ( 42 % decrease ) and mEPSC amplitude ( 32 % decrease ) than overexpression of @GENE$ ( 18 % - 20 % increase in surface @GENE$ and mEPSC amplitudes ; Huo et al	1
8493	, 2015 )	1
8494	The more modest effects of @GENE$ overexpression are consistent with the low intrinsic catalytic activity of @GENE$ in the absence of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Cohn et al	1
8495	, 2009 ; Faesen et al	1
8496	, 2011 )	1
8497	Intriguingly , Huo et al	1
8498	( 2015 ) also showed that @GENE$ , but not @GENE$ , was able to regulate GluA1 in neurons	1
8499	It will be interesting to determine how @GENE$ and @GENE$ achieve substrate specificity in vivo given that they can both interact with @GENE$ and @GENE$ .	1
8500	Bacterial isolates	1
8501	To investigate whether the schedule of N3 treatment is ideal for protecting from @DISEASE$ in vivo , 7 - day old hSCAR@GENE$ were preinfected s	1

8504	An isoty@GENE$ iven at the same concentration ( 200 mg ) as control in this study ( Fig	1
8505	4 )	1
8506	It was found that the mice had a better survival rate correlating to a shorter time interval of N3 administration post EV71 infection ; mice were fully protected when given one dose of	1
8507	Continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range ( IQR ) , categorical variables as number and percentage	1
8508	@DISEASE$ cases we compared to the controls by the Mann - Whitney U test for continuous covariates , and by the Chi 2 test for categorical variables	1
8509	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with @DISEASE$	1
8510	Multivariate analyses were adjusted for gender , age , period per quarter , and other pathogens significantly associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$	1
8511	Concordance between serotypes detected in nasopharyngeal samples and blood was tested by Kendall rank correlation .	1
8512	In order to further pinpoint which domains and @GENE$ in the @GENE$ have evolved under positive selection , we sequenced additional @GENE$ from a diverse panel of primates	1
8513	Combining these with publically available sequences , we aligned and analyzed 15 or more @GENE$ for each @GENE$ ( Table S1 , Figure S4 )	1
8514	Based on these expanded alignments , we confirmed the results of our initial screen ; all @GENE$ have evolved under positive selection in Figure 1A	1

8526	In contrast to the recurrent positive selection on only a single exon of @GENE$ , we found that positively selected sites were broadly distributed throughout the @GENE$ ( Figure 3A )	1
8527	For all three @GENE$ , we observed strong evidence of positive selection acting on the @GENE$	1
8528	However , removal of the @GENE$ did not result in a loss of positive selection signatures , indicating that both @GENE$ as well as other domains have evolved under positive selection ( Figure 3B )	1
8529	For instance , we found significant evidence for positive selection in the @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( Figure 3B ) , similar to @GENE$ [ 37 ]	1
8530	In contrast , our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection acting on the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Figure 3B ) , although it is possible that sequencing of additional @GENE$ might reveal more subtle signatures of selection	1
8531	Thus , we conclude that @GENE$ are evolving very rapidly , including substantial positive selection in the @GENE$ of all three @GENE$ .	1
8532	Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal ( NP - OP ) swab samples were collected from children ( 1 - 59 months ) hospitalized with @DISEASE$ , four of whom were enrolled in the PERCH study [ 18 ] in 2012	1
8533	The fifth sample was collected from a child enrolled in the routine @DISEASE$ surveillance study at Kilifi County Hospital , Kenya , in 2015	1
8534	The samples were tested for HMPV by multiplex semi - quantitative real - time reverse transcription PCR ( rRT - PCR ) assays	1
8535	The @GENE$ primers and probes used , cycling conditions and assay set up have been described elsewhere [ 28 , 29 ]	1
8536	@GENE$ of the HMPV positive samples were amplified in a one - step RT - PCR assay ( OneStep RT - PCR kit , QIAGEN ) , as described previously [ 7 ]	1
8537	Partial @GENE$ were analyzed by maximum likelihood ( ML ) phylogenetic trees using IQ - TREE [ 30 ] , together with reference strains of HMPV subgroups ( accession numbers AF371337	1

8652	Recently , genetic variation in the region of the @GENE$ on @GENE$ , coding for @GENE$ , has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with @DISEASE$ in patients with genotype 1 @DISEASE$ who are treated with pEG - @GENE$ BV in the nontransplant setting [ 23 , 24 ]	1
8653	IL28B @GENE$ rphism has also been associated with spontaneous @DISEASE$ clearance [ 25 ]	1
8654	One cohort study , Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive @DISEASE$ patients undergoing LT , aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and reci@GENE$ IL28B genotypes among @DISEASE$ recipients [ 26 ]	1
8655	The authors suggested that recipient I@GENE$ T genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of @DISEASE$ after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with @DISEASE$ .	1
8656	The complete network has assortativity coefficients close to zero , meaning there is not a tendency for similar nodes to connect to or avoid each other	1
8657	This holds true within the GSCC for all node sampling schemes ( electronic supplementary material , figure S4 )	1
8658	Similar behaviour is observed for the mean local clustering coefficient , which is small and does not change appreciably	1
8659	The network diameter is 24 - TNS and SBS preserve this relatively small diameter well within the GSCC , but for small sample sizes the diameter increases under the RNS scheme	1
8660	Plots for assortativity , clustering and diameter are shown in electronic supplementary material , figure S4 .	1
8661	Several studies have indicated that a peptide spanning aa 2 - 120 of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a major component of the commercially available second - generation anti - HCV tests	1
8662	Our study demonstrates that the full - length @GENE$ has better reactivity than @GENE$	1
8663	It is possible that the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ contains key peptide sequences for constructing the viral particle and regulating viral assembly ( 4 , 20 ) .	1
8664	The presence of high - titer @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ infections of reservoir hosts indicates both T cell and B cell responses occur because T cells induce class switching and affinity maturation of a@GENE$ roduced by antigen - specific B cells	1
8665	In experimental infections of rats with SEOV and deer mice with @DISEASE$ , early infection results in subtle inflammatory signatures , but a regulatory T cell ( Treg ) response predominates at persistence ( Figure 1 ) [ 20 , 54@GENE$ Treg responses are critical for suppressing inflammation [ 71 , 72 ] ; however , inflammation is a prominent feature of @DISEASE$ in humans [ 73 ] and hamsters [ 55 , 74 ]	1
8666	In other @DISEASE$ , the occurrence of a Treg resp@GENE$ is associated with persistent infection because these cells , while suppressing inflammation , also prevent virus clearance [ 75 , 76 ]	1
8667	For reservoirs of @DISEASE$ , the Treg respons@GENE$  limit inflammatory immunopathology to an otherwise innocuous infection , but it may also impair virus clearance	1
8668	How this relationship evolved is unknown , but considering the presence of hantavirus p@GENE$ odulatory activities , it suggests the viruses may manipulate the host response to favor persistence ; a Treg respons@GENE$  prevent sterilizing immunity , thus allow virus to remain in a population	1
8669	It may also explain the ecoimmunology and ecology of @DISEASE$ infections of reservoir hosts , thus studies assessing the energetics of inflammatory and anti - inflammatory immune responses should be performed .	1
8670	The following data were considered for the study : age and sex of the patient , month of the visit , triage colour tag , @DISEASE$ severity ( see Table 1 ) [ 8 ] , etiology of the exacerbation , previous history of @DISEASE$ or other chronic conditions ( if reported ) , use of long - term control therapy for @DISEASE$ , vital signs , presence and severity of @DISEASE$ , severity of the exacerbation , administered therapy , and discharge modality ( home , short - stay observation in the ED , and admission to the Pediatric Unit Ward or to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ) .	1

8672	Many computational thermodynamics - based methods find the structures with the minimum free energy ( MFE ) from the set of all possible structures , when each structure feature is assigned a free energy value and the energy of a structure is calculated as the sum of the features ' energies	1
8673	There has been significant success in prediction of pseudoknot - free secondary structures ( structures with no crossing base pairs ) [ 23 , 25 , 26 ]	1
8674	While many @GENE$ secondary structures are pseudoknot - free , many biologically important @GENE$ , both in the cell [ 27 , 28 ] , and in @GENE$ [ 29 ] are found to be pseudoknotted .	1
8675	We found that excluding data based on the following criteria significantly reduced the effect of background interference that can result from Fourier analysis : ( 1 ) the amplitude of the peak must be greater than three times the amplitude of the background ( defined as the maximum peak of the first three FFT Mag ) , ( 2 ) the CBF must be within a clinically relevant range ( for example between 3 to 20 Hz for respiratory cilia and 3 to 60 Hz for brain ependymal cilia )	1
8676	Data that does not support these criteria was defined as 0 Hz .	1

8692	CPPs have been successfully utilized to enhance the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of antiviral molecules , and thereby increase the inhibitory activity of potential antiv@GENE$ ligonucleotide analogues , both in cultured cells and in animal models	1
8693	This review will address the notable findings of these studies , highlighting some promising results and discussing the challenges CPP technology has to overcome for further clinical applications .	1
8694	Polyamines play several roles in the eukaryotic cell and likely affect virus replication at several stages	1
8695	By isolating DFMO escape mutants , we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection	1
8696	Here , we have isolated two @GENE$ following passage of CVB3 in DFMO	1
8697	We previously characterized escape mutants for @DISEASE$ and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [ 31 ]	1
8698	In contrast , we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either protease@GENE$ ur data , we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease@GENE$  against a specific target ; however , we observe that both viral pr@GENE$  activity in polyamine - depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment	1
8699	Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation .	1
8700	To quantify resistance , we measured viral titers of wildtype and protease - mutant virus in untreated and DFMO - treated Vero cells over a concentration range ( Figure 2B )	1
8701	We infected these cells at MOI 0	1
8702	1 and measured viral titers at 48 hpi	1
8703	We again observed significant sensitivity by the wildtype virus with any concentration of DFMO ; in contrast , both protease mutants exhibited significant resistance , again suggesting that these mutations confer resistance to polyamine depletion	1
8704	We then measured percent replication by dividing the titer in DFMO treatment conditions ( 500 µM ) by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C )	1
8705	We observed that compared to wildtype virus , all mutants exhibited higher replication , and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance	1
8706	Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication ; however , this difference was not statistically significant .	1
8707	To determine whether they could affect the production of infectious HIV - 1 viral particles , @GENE$ were ectopically expressed along with @GENE$ coding for single round infection - competent HIV - 1 viruses in HEK293T cells , according to the scheme depicted in Figure 1A	1
8708	The @GENE$ coded the @GENE$ plus @GENE$ , the indicated envelope , as well as a @GENE$ bearing a @GENE$ , except where a complete provirus was used , as indicated	1
8709	Two days after transfection , supernatants were pre - cleared by centrifugation at low speed , then by filtration through a 0 , 45 μm syringe filter and were lastly purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion	1
8710	Under these conditions , expression of @GENE$ induced only a minor defect of virus production , as quantified by exogenous - RT activity ( @GENE$ , Additional file 1 : Figure S1A )	1
8711	To focus solely on the infectivity defect of retrieved viral particles , virions were normalized by @GENE$ and then used to challenge either HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV receptor / co - receptor @GENE$ , prior to flow cytometry 3 days afterwards ( a typical FACS profile is presented in Figure 1B )	1
8712	Virions produced in the presence of the different @GENE$ displayed reduced infectivity over wild type ones ( 70 % to 75 % reduction over a single round infection assay , Figure 1C , left graph )	1
8713	To determine whether this defect could be observed using a WT HIV - 1 clone ( NL4 - 3 , a widely used proviral clone ) , the same experimental system was used on viruses produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
8714	Upon @GENE$ normalization , virions were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells and viral infectivity was measured by @GENE$ assay ( MAGI ) 24 hours afterwards , taking advantage of the @GENE$ stably integrated in these cells ( Figure 1C , right graph )	1
8715	Under these conditions , @GENE$ imparted a similar infectivity defect to produced viruses ( from 70 to 90 % reduction for the different IFITMs ) .	1
8716	The comparison of IHC scores among the different sections of the oviduct identified the infundibulum as the section recording the highest values ( Table 2 )	1
8717	IHC positivity was mostly limited to the nuclei and cytoplasm of the mucosal epithelia , even though we observed a specific and intense staining at the level of the serosal surface of the oviduct in 2 / 7 and 1 / 7 birds , on days 4 and 6 , respectively .	1
8718	Protein samples were separated by SDS - PAGE [ 56 ] and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , UK )	1
8719	Membranes were blocked with 3 % @GENE$ and incubated with the appropriate @GENE$ ( Ab )	1
8720	@GENE$ was detected by a @GENE$ recognizing @GENE$ ( Seramun , Heidesee , Germany )	1
8721	The @GENE$ was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St	1
8722	Louis , MO , USA )	1
8723	The anti - mouse and anti - rabbit Viruses 2017 , 9 , 222 5 of 22 @GENE$ coupled to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were obtained from Dianova ( Hamburg , Germany )	1
8724	@GENE$ was visualized using an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) directly conjugated to @GENE$ ( Roche ) .	1
8725	Coimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both @GENE$ and @GENE$ revealed that @GENE$ could efficiently associate with the latter ( Figure 4A , upper panel , lane 2 )	1
8726	Exposure of the same blot to X - ray film revealed the band specific to @GENE$ in @GENE$ and ORF2 cotransfected cells ( Figure 4A , lower panel , lane 2 )	1
8727	3 rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the @GENE$ , as judged by immunoprecipitation using @GENE$	1
8728	Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of @GENE$ with another @GENE$ , @GENE$	1
8729	We were unable to detect any interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 4B , top panel )	1
8730	In order to ensure that @GENE$ was indeed functional in these experiments , the same blot was stripped and reprobed with @GENE$	1
8731	Endogenous @GENE$ was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed @GENE$ ( Figure 4B , middle panel ) and similarly IP using @GENE$ revealed its interaction with the @GENE$ ( Figure 4B transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix and lysates were immunoprecipitated with @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ , respectively ; subsequently , samples were immunoblotted with @GENE$	1

8734	Thus selection of strategies has substantial impact on the expected benefits .	1
8735	Also in the source control scenarios the health benefits are a result of both effects ;	1
8736	To investigate the mechanism of lymphocyte activation following @DISEASE$ we first analyzed the kinetics of CD69@GENE$ gulation on splenic lymphocytes at several time points following infection	1
8737	CD69@GENE$ ession was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [ 16 ] and became detectable at 14 hours post - infection , peaked at 16 to 24 hours , and returned almost to background levels by 72 hours ( Figure 1A )	1
8738	The induction of CD69@GENE$ rred on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , as well as B cells ( Figure 1B )	1
8739	In addition to the spleen , CD69@GENE$ gulation was also observed , albeit to a lesser extent , on lymphocytes from the blood , lymph nodes , and bone marrow ( Figure 1C )	1
8740	In contrast , no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the thymus , which are primarily immature T cells	1
8741	In contrast to CD69@GENE$ e IL -@GENE$ 25@GENE$ which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on TCR @GENE$ tion [ 21 ] , did not increase in expression during the first day of @DISEASE$ ( data not shown )	1
8742	This result is consistent with partial rather than full activation of the lymphocytes .	1
8743	Background : A growing diversity of biological data is tagged with unique identifiers ( UIDs ) associated with polynucleotides and proteins to ensure efficient computer - mediated data storage , maintenance , and processing	1
8744	These identifiers , which are not informative for most people , are often substituted by biologically meaningful names in various presentations to facilitate utilization and dissemination of sequence - based knowledge	1
8745	This substitution is commonly done manually that may be a tedious exercise prone to mistakes and omissions .	1
8746	Here { V k , t } are the visit counts for city k and { T k , t } is the smoothed time series of temperatures for city k , filtered by taking a thirty day moving average to remove intra - month variation	1
8747	To complete the model we assume that { X k , t } is a zero mean stationary time series ( we discuss the consequences of this assumption in the Discussion ) , that we shall represent using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average process ( SARIMA )	1
8748	The SARIMA model ( defined in the Appendix ) allows for simultaneous modeling of dependencies on both the day as well as the weekly seasonal scales	1
8749	To aid in the comparison of the dependencies across cities , the order of the time series model , as determined by choosing the autoregressive ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and moving average orders ( q k and Q k ) , will be the same for each city k .	1
8750	Several factors may alter long - term , low - level viral persistence in bats	1
8751	Suppression of the immune response holding active virus replication in check would allow the virus to replicate to higher levels	1
8752	This could happen in stressful conditions that affects the immune system	1
8753	In other animals , a variety of stressors lead to reactivation of latent herpesviruses as reviewed by Grinde [ 48 , 49 ]	1
8754	In neurons latently infected by herpes simplex virus - 1 ( HSV - 1 ) , viral replication is inhibited by the recruitment of CD8 + T cells which secrete @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and suppress @GENE$ via noncytolytic granzyme mediated degradation [ 50 ]	1
8755	During stress , there is a reduction of HSV - specific CD8 + T cells capable of producing @GENE$	1
8756	This contributes to reactivation of the virus [ 51 ]	1
8757	Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus - 68 ( MHV - 68 ) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [ 52 , 53 ]	1
8758	Stressors , such as @GENE$ responses and @DISEASE$ , can induce the expression o@GENE$ s that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ] .	1
8759	A previous study showed that @GENE$ decreases the CSFV @GENE$ - mediated translation in a dose - dependent manner [ 13 ]	1
8760	To examine the effects of @GENE$ on the @GENE$ - mediated inhibition of the CSFV @GENE$ activity , the @GENE$ reporter assay was used in this study	1
8761	The results showed that @GENE$ ( Figure 5A ) , as well as @GENE$ ( Figure 5B ) , inhibited the CSFV @GENE$ activity in a dose - dependent manner	1
8762	To further investigate the inhibitory effects of @GENE$ and @GENE$ coexpression , @GENE$ were cotransfected with the @GENE$ into HEK293T cells	1
8763	The results indicated that the @GENE$ did not antagonize the inhibition of the @GENE$ activity by @GENE$ when @GENE$ and @GENE$ were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ) .	1
8764	Cells were mock - infected or infected with EV - D68 or EV - A71 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0	1

8766	After 2 h of virus adsorption , cells were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) one time , then added fresh culture medium .	1
8767	A panel of 23 standard positive sera , 8 standard negative sera , a set of quality control references for anti - HCV detection that contain known amounts of @GENE$ ( Artron BioResearch Inc	1
8768	, Burnaby , BC , Canada ) and 300 clinical sera were used for the antigenicity assessment of @GENE$	1
8769	Other reagents and instruments included @GENE$ , 30 - 60 nm colloidal gold particles ( from Artron BioResearch Inc	1
8770	) , HCV - ELISA ( KHB , Shanghai , China ) , a NanoDrop ® ND - 1000 Spectrophotometer , a Bio - Rad BioLogic LP , ZQ4000 test strip cutter , and XYZ - 3000 Bio - Dot ( all from Bio - Rad , Shanghai , China ) .	1
8771	After the nested - PCR amplification , 5 μL reaction mixtures was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2 % agarose gel containing 0	1
8772	5 μg ethidium bromide per mL	1
8773	The positive products were gel purified for DNA sequencing using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
8774	DNA sequencing was performed using the Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Qiagen ) on a DNA analyser .	1
8775	Recurrence of @DISEASE$ in the liver allograft is universal after LT , and its natural history is variable	1
8776	It has been estimated that approximately 20 % of recipients will progress to @DISEASE$ within 5 years of transplant [ 7 ]	1
8777	Overall , @DISEASE$ is more aggressive in the posttransplant recipients than in patients whose immunity is intact [ 8 ]	1
8778	Accelerated disease progression is multifactorial and probably depends on a number of variables , including host , donor , viral , and external factors	1
8779	However , the definite interactions between these factors and recurrent @DISEASE$ in the liver allograft still remain controversial and poorly defined	1
8780	Thus , to identify recipients at risk for rapid @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT will be helpful especially when considering treatment with the currently available antiviral agents either as prophylaxis or therapy	1
8781	To date , a number of risk factors have been mentioned regarding this clinical issue .	1
8782	In addition , no significant difference in populations of T cells was detected in uninfected mice in either compartment ( Additional file 3 )	1
8783	Because of the sensitivity of microglia and @DISEASE@GENE$ SF1R antagonism , we assessed whe@GENE$ SF1R antagonism depleted CD11b + , Ly6C + , and Ly6G + cells in the blood , spleen , and bone marrow of PLX5622 - treated versus control - treated uninfected mice	1
8784	Flow cytometry analysis revealed no significant differences in populations of these cells in uninfected mice ( Additional file 4 )	1
8785	Together , these data indicate that circulating @DISEASE$ , but not bone marrow or splenic mononuclear cells , are decreased in the c@GENE$  of CSF1R antagonism .	1
8786	We postulated that if @DISEASE$ is caused by an infection , we should observe a predictable rise of PBs in the peripheral blood	1
8787	We collected samples from 18 children with @DISEASE$ and 69 febrile controls presenting to the emergency department	1
8788	Overall , we saw an increase in IGG + B cells , but not a cumulative increase in B cells [ 149 ]	1
8789	Notably , we did not observe an increase in circulating IgA + B cells	1
8790	The result of this study is consistent with the majority of the literature that shows B cell stimulation and increasing peripheral B cell numbers during @DISEASE$ [ 4 , 5 , 99 , 100 ]	1
8791	Both @DISEASE$ and infectious control children showed comparable elevations of PBs compared to controls [ 149 ]	1
8792	Importantly , the le@GENE$ did not correlate with CRPs and were not excessive , which are characteristics of PB responses in @DISEASE$	1
8793	Unfortunately , only five children had repeat samples	1
8794	Of these five , all had PB elevations on one or both timepoints , leaving only 3 of 18 @DISEASE$ samples not having a measurable elevation of their PBs in this study generally limited to one timepoint	1
8795	We are currently collecting samples over multiple timepoints to more thoroughly explore this phenomenon .	1
8796	Proteomics research is a potentially useful and effective tool for studying pathogenesis , establishing prognosis and determining treatment outcomes in a variety of diseases	1
8797	In the field of @DISEASE$ , proteomics is not widely performed , presumably due to the mechanism of @DISEASE$ being so complicated	1
8798	The aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with @DISEASE$ and HBV - induced @DISEASE$ , respectively , compared with @GENE$ y controls using iTRAQ and western blotting	1
8799	The authors hypothesized that this approach had the potential to ultimately be beneficial for the identification of proteins that were important in the progression of @DISEASE$ .	1
8800	The iLIR web resource can make the distinction between xLIR and WxxL patterns	1
8801	27 , 28 We noticed that a vast majority of the motifs identified in @GENE$ correspond to the WxxL pattern ( Fig	1
8802	2B and Table S1 )	1
8803	The identification of @GENE$ has been done for all the reviewed sequences for @GENE$	1
8804	Among the sequences sorted as @GENE$ , 1517 sequences belong to 188 species of bacteriophages ( Table S2 )	1
8805	However , it is likely that these sequences correspond to false - positive hits as bacteria don ' t have an autophagy process	1
8806	Using a hypergeometric test ( see supplementary information ) , we compared the enrichment fold of proteins containing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in bacteriophages with viruses infecting eukaryotes	1
8807	We noticed that the enrichment fold for both xLIR and WxxL patterns in @GENE$ was higher in viruses infecting eukaryotes than in bacteriophages ( Table S2 ) which is in line with the fact that autophagy has been reported only in eukaryotes .	1
8808	Two of five shelters in NSW did not vaccinate cats while under their care	1
8809	The other three shelters vaccinated healthy cats on admission using an inactivated FPV vaccine , whereas sick cats with suspected @DISEASE$ were not vaccinated until their clinical signs resolved .	1
8810	Over the past few decades , disease outbreaks have become increasingly frequent and widespread	1
8811	The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed , and could be linked to different economic contexts	1
8812	Arguably , the responses to these outbreaks have been Bpolitical ^ and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations	1
8813	Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings	1
8814	Based on a review of the published medical , social , and political literature , which was accessed using four electronic databases - PubMed , Sociological Abstracts , Scholars Portal , and Web of Science , the overall objective of this paper discuss scholars ' narratives on the @DISEASE$ ^ of Ebola in a low - income setting , @DISEASE$ in a middle - income setting , and @DISEASE$ in a high - income setting	1
8815	Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature	1
8816	The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature	1
8817	While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts , the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited	1
8818	Regardless of income setting , there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic	1
8819	The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic - specifically poor communities - need to be represented in the literature	1
8820	This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics .	1
8821	On the basis of the expression levels in the F 0 69 line , the F 0 90 line produced 12	1
8822	25 times more @GENE$ in the liver and the F 0 110 and F 0 135 lines showed 0	1
8823	29 and 0	1
8824	07 times less than that of the F 0 69 line	1
8825	However , the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines had 3 , 270 and 3 , 174 times more @GENE$ in the brain than that of the F 0 69 line , even 201	1
8826	98 times more in F 0 110	1
8827	Therefore , the F 0 69 line was used as a control and the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after @DISEASE$ infection ( Figure 7A ) .	1
8828	Although we have demonstrated the antiviral effect attributed by @GENE$ and @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ without any cytotoxic effect on the host cells in this study ( Figure S1A and S1B ) , possibility of the @GENE$ damaged by non - specific @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ cannot be entirely ruled out	1
8829	In our previous study , when we tested the potential cytotoxic effect of @GENE$ on HeLa cells with varying concentration of @GENE$ ( 5 - 40 mM ) for 48 hrs , the cell viability was found to drop by , 50 - 60 % upon 10 mM of @GENE$ treatment , while treatment of the cells with 1 mM and 5 mM @GENE$ exhibited no significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h of incubation ( 0 and , 20 % respectively ) [ 40 ]	1
8830	This may indicate that the host cells indeed begin to be affected by the Figure 7	1

8834	The STG90 line expressed high levels of @GENE$ in both the brain and muscle , whereas the STG135 line expressed high amounts of @GENE$ in the brain ; these strains were selected for further antiviral preventive studies	1
8835	The relative expression of @GENE$ was calculated after normalization to the @GENE$ using the delta delta C T method	1

8857	Although it is not clear on exactly how much 3D8 scFv protein actually penetrated into the cells from media when 5 mM 3D8 scFv protein was administered , 5 mM 3D8 scFv is fairly large amount of proteins for in vitro cytotoxicity analysis even though we used the same amount of the proteins for in vivo survival experiments with mice ( Figure 7 )	1
8858	On the other hand , the actual level of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cells such as in SCH07072 cell line was too low to be even detected by Western blot analysis , although its expression was confirmed by confocal microscopic observation and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 1 )	1
8859	Therefore , it can be concluded that the low concentration of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cell lines or TG mice is generally sufficient for conferring antiviral effects without incurring damage to the host DNA , but the likelihood of 3D8 scFv having deleterious impact on host cells as well through non - specific nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity remains valid , especially at higher concentration of the protein .	1
8860	Comparative data from international studies do lend support to the theory that cultural values and societal norms impact upon quarantine compliance rates	1

8863	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed residents of Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore , and the U	1
8864	S	1
8865	and found significant regional variability [ 22 ]	1
8866	The proportion of survey respondents favouring the quarantine of persons suspected of having been exposed to a serious @DISEASE$ was as follows : 76 % in the U	1
8867	S	1
8868	, 81 % in Hong Kong , 89 % in Singapore , and 95 % in Taiwan	1
8869	By way of comparison , in the present study , 94 % of respondents agreed that quarantine is a good way to stop the spread of @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
8870	Interestingly , in our study , significantly fewer ( 58 % ) agreed that public health officials should be able to detain those who fail to obey quarantine orders	1
8871	Likewise , in the Harvard study , the proportions favouring the use of quarantine decrease significantly if people could be arrested for refusing ( to a low of only 42 % in the U	1
8872	S	1
8873	to a high of 70 % in Taiwan )	1
8874	The authors partially attributed the observed differences to prior experience with @DISEASE$ outbreaks in which quarantine and other restrictive measures were implemented [ 21 ] .	1
8875	iii .	1
8876	Second , considering governance approaches for the successful control of @DISEASE$ requires a focus on both whole of society and sector specific approaches [ 19 ]	1
8877	This was detailed in a previous paper where we proposed a new governance framework to investigate power relations and responses for diverse stakeholders addressing @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
8878	As Kickbusch mentioned , and further discussed in our paper , recently there has been a diffusion of governance moving from a model dominated by the state to a model co - produced by a wide range of actors [ 27 ]	1
8879	As a result , Kickbusch has identified five types of governance present in whole - of - government approaches	1
8880	These include : ( 1 ) governing among others by mixing regulation and persuasion ; ( 2 ) by collaborating ; ( 3 ) by engaging citizens ;	1

8888	The findings of this study revealed that infection control and prevention are not available in @DISEASE$ wards	1
8889	The nurses expressed a need for those	1
8890	Nurses and patients were at a great risk of contracting @DISEASE$ in the wards	1
8891	The findings of this study agree with those study by Tshitangano et al	1
8892	[ 8 ] , which concluded that infection control plans are not available at the hospitals in Vhembe District , and this results in a high risk of @DISEASE$ infection transmission in the hospitals .	1
8893	To determine which input structures are good to use when G big is not known , we compare two different options	1
8894	Since HFold ( HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold ) cannot accept pseudoknotted input structures we use the following methods to produce pseudoknot - free input structures to HFold ( HFold - PKonly and Iterative HFold )	1
8895	First , we use @GENE$ [ 36 ] , i	1
8896	e	1
8897	, the 20 lowest energy @GENE$ produced in the first phase of @GENE$	1
8898	We choose the lowest free energy structure predicted by each of our methods as their final prediction given these hotspots	1
8899	Second , we use @GENE$ ' s @GENE$ structure [ 63 ] where the energy parameters of @GENE$ are changed to match that of @GENE$ V2	1
8900	0 .	1
8901	The take home message from our work is that when developing models for public health use , we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks	1
8902	While some practitioners are already using the approach we advocate [ 3 , 15 , 34 , 39 , 47 ] , the vast majority of applied epidemiological studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods	1
8903	Perhaps this work points to the next steps in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological models .	1
8904	Significant bacterial cultures were found in 16 of 33 ( 48	1
8905	5 % ) children ( Table 2 )	1
8906	No significant differences in the number of positive BAL - cultures were seen in children with or without @DISEASE$ .	1
8907	Estimating R 0 from Trajectory Matching While the results described in the previous section are based on the rate of epidemic take - off , we reach the same qualitative conclusions about the effects of the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating R 0 by other data - fitting methods	1
8908	For illustration , we use data from an @DISEASE$ outbreak in an English boarding school [ 37 ] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching	1
8909	In the absence of independent data , this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters	1
8910	Of course , here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges , since the @DISEASE$ virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [ 38 ]	1
8911	We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n	1
8912	For comparison , we also determine the best - fit parameters in the absence of any latent period	1
8913	The least squares errors and estimated R 0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3	1
8914	These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section : ( i ) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R 0 , and ( ii ) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R 0 than their gammadistributed counterparts .	1
8915	Patients with a positive bacterial BAL - culture , had a significantly higher TTC ( median 1893	1

8923	Cytology of BAL - fluid differed significantly between patients with @DISEASE$ isolated from BAL and patients with a negative BAL - culture ( Table 3 ) .	1
8924	Viruses are important causes of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in developing countries [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]	1
8925	The most common cause of @DISEASE$ is RNA viruses : @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , human @DISEASE$ ( PIV ) , @DISEASE$ , and human metapneumovirus ( hMPV )	1
8926	Adenovirus is probably the only DNA virus that is a common cause of @DISEASE$ in children [ 2 ] .	1
8927	The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest .	1
8928	Porcine pathogenic E	1
8929	coli involved in @DISEASE$ typically belong to serogroups O8 , O138 , O139 , O141 , O147 , O157 and O149 , the latter being the predominant serogroup in most countries [ 56 , 57 ]	1
8930	The most implicated virotype in @DISEASE$ is ETEC : LT : STb : F4 [ 6 ]	1
8931	However , O se@GENE$ ulence gene patterns vary from region to region and over time [ 2 ] .	1
8932	The frequencies of occurrence for dinucleotides were not randomly distributed and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies	1
8933	And the frequency of CpG and TpA was significantly low at all @GENE$ for coding region of 48 polioviruses genomes ( mean ± S	1

8951	In addition , the RSCU values of the eight @GENE$ containing CpG ( CCG , GCG , UCG , ACG , CGC , CGG , CGU , and CGA ) were analyzed , to reveal the possible effects of CpG under - represented on codon usage bias	1
8952	All of these eight codons were not preferential codons and were markedly suppressed	1
8953	The six @GENE$ containing @GENE$ ( UUA , CUA , GUA , UAU , UAC and AUA ) were suppressed too	1
8954	Conversely , the RSCU values of the eight @GENE$ containing CpA ( UCA , CCA , ACA , GCA , CAA , CAG , CAU , CAC ) and five @GENE$ containing UpG ( UUG , GUG , UGU , UGC , CUG ) are high , and most of them ( 8 out of 13 ) were preferential codons ( Table 2 and Table 5 )	1
8955	In addition , compared with DVPVs and live attenuated strain of polioviruses genotype 1 , the wild viruses has higher frequencies of dinucleotides including CpG ( Figure 2 and Table 5 ) .	1
8956	The data were collected in a Microsoft Excel5 database	1
8957	A descriptive analysis was performed for continuous variables ( median , 25th and 75th percentiles )	1
8958	Data distribution was checked using MedCal Statistical Software ( Version 17	1
8959	4 MedCalc Software , Ostend , Belgium ) .	1
8960	Importantly , these studies have been conducted with cells from nonreservoir hosts where they , presumably , are not optimized for manipulating the immune response in a manner that benefits the virus but without host pathology	1
8961	Future studies should examine the roles of these proteins in cells from reservoir hosts .	1
8962	To determine the contributions of various regions of the @GENE$ and @GENE$ to infectivity diagnosis , clones of the @GENE$ and different @GENE$ were expressed in E	1
8963	coli cells and the @GENE$ proteins were used to test human anti - HCV - positive sera in the ELISA and the rapid lateral flow test strip	1
8964	The data suggested that the full - length @GENE$ and the new @GENE$ ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) were suitable for analyzing the presence of @GENE$ against individual @GENE$ teins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from @DISEASE$	1
8965	These results are in agreement with those of previous studies in which the putative nucleo@GENE$ an@GENE$ non - @GENE$ ) @GENE$  found to contain the most immuno@GENE$  ( 16 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) .	1
8966	In order to explore the epidemiological effects of the various sampling methods , we compare each method with simulations run on the full network	1
8967	The robustness of a sampling method is determined by whether the mean simulation for a method using a certain percentage of data lies within the 95 % CIs of the mean of simulations run in the full network	1
8968	We focus on key epidemiological quantities such as final size , peak size and epidemic duration	1
8969	While it is informative to explore the effect of partial knowledge upon epidemic duration , for rspb	1

8975	We therefore also look at predictions of the epidemic size after 6 and 12 weeks using the different sampling methods	1
8976	We denote the threshold at which a scheme fails to be robust as S min , the minimum sampling threshold	1
8977	Initially , we set b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 days	1
8978	Sensitivity to these parameter values is explored below ( electronic supplementary material , figures S13 - S16 ) .	1
8979	Adenoviruses ( Adv ) are nonenveloped , double - stranded DNA viruses that can cause @DISEASE$ either in sporadic fashion or as epidemics	1
8980	Currently , 49 distinct Adv serotypes have been isolated from humans	1
8981	Adv typically cause mild self - limited @DISEASE$	1
8982	Although Adv can cause a variety of clinical manifestations , in @DISEASE$ patients , @DISEASE$ often leads to fatal outcomes	1
8983	For example , in @DISEASE$ states such as a solid organ or stem cell transplantation , severe @DISEASE$ may occur , with mortality up to 80 % [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] .	1
8984	Aloe vera ( [ 43 ]	1
8985	More examples of @GENE$ inhibitors included some Salvia essential oils from South Africa	1
8986	The authors attributed such activities to the presence of 1 , 8 - cineole , α - pinene and βcaryophyllene in the essential oils [ 98 ]	1
8987	The same major components present in the essential oils of four indigenous South African Helichrysum species were also reported to inhibit @GENE$ [ 99 ]	1
8988	Chamazulene and α - bisabolol are examples of other components , present in the essential oil of chamomile , with anti - inflammatory activities partly due to the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis since they appear to be good @GENE$ inhibitors [ 17 ]	1
8989	The essential oils of leaves and rhizomes of Alpinia murdochii Ridl	1
8990	, Alpinia scabra ( Blume ) Náves and leaves of Alpinia pahangensis Ridl	1
8991	also showed to be good @GENE$ inhibitors	1
8992	β - Pinene , α - pinene and sabinene were the main components of the leaf oils , whilst the sesquiterpenes γ - selinene , α - selinene and α - panasinsen predominated in the rhizome oils [ 100 ]	1

8999	Some authors showed that from the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea , only α - humelene was able to reduce significantly the increase of @GENE$ and @GENE$ levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw after LPS treatment [ 113 ] or in carrageenan - injected rats , whereas ( - ) - trans - caryophyllene diminished only @GENE$ release [ 114 ] .	1
9000	The resulting Excel data sheet presents the @GENE$ calculations as a report that allows the observer to obtain information about individual regions of interest or the image as a whole	1
9001	Raw data ( including pixel intensities and the power spectrum of the FFT ( Figure 1B ) ) from individual regions of interest can be inspected using a drop - down menu	1
9002	The results report displays the mean , median and modal @GENE$ of the field , and a histogram of the @GENE$ of all regions of interest ( Figure 2A )	1
9003	A color chart of the intensity of the @GENE$ for each regions of interest is also presented in Figure 2B .	1
9004	@GENE$ are crucial in different levels of cellular function , ranging from translation and regulation of genes to coding for proteins [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]	1
9005	Understanding the structure of an @GENE$ is important in inferring its function [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]	1

9009	While thermodynamics - based approaches can be less accurate than comparative - based algorithms , thermodynamics - based approaches are applicable in cases of @GENE$ such as the many @GENE$ of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium [ 24 ]	1
9010	Thermodynamics - based approaches can also be easier to apply to prediction of the structure of @GENE$ , for example , in gene knockdown studies .	1
9011	We present the first full genome sequences of circulating HMPV strains from sub - Saharan Africa	1
9012	A limitation of our sequencing method , as is common with amplicon sequencing protocols [ 26 , 27 ] , was absent coverage at the @GENE$ not captured by these primers	1
9013	Our results demonstrate the application of amplicon sequencing to generate full length HMPV genomes directly from clinical samples	1
9014	The observed diversity of the individual genes is comparable to that described previously [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
9015	This method and data provide a useful reference for design of local molecular diagnostics and for studies aimed at understanding HMPV epidemiology and evolution in Africa .	1
9016	Our finding that @GENE$ encoded by @GENE$ have evolved under positive selection motivated us to investigate whether equivalent residues were rapidly evolving in each @GENE$	1
9017	Such a conserved pattern could suggest that related genetic conflicts ( for example , similar viral pathogens ) drove their evolution	1
9018	Instead , we observed that a different set of residues is rapidly evolving in each @GENE$ at a primary sequence level ( Figure 3C , Tables S6 - S8 and Alignment S3 )	1
9019	While equivalent amino acids are not evolving in all @GENE$ , it is possible that positive selection has acted on a single threedimensional protein surface	1
9020	We therefore modeled the positively selected residues from @GENE$ and PARP14 @GENE$ onto a structure that has been determined for the first @GENE$ of @GENE$ [ 48 ]	1
9021	We found that positively selected residues map to a single surface of each @GENE$ , but that each @GENE$ shows positive selection on a distinct surface ( Figure 3D )	1
9022	As each positively - selected surface is distinct relative to the site of ADPribose binding , these results suggest that ADP - ribose binding is not being altered or optimized by positive selection of the @GENE$	1
9023	Instead , our findings suggest that each @GENE$ has engaged in its own evolutionary arms race with @GENE$ ( see Discussion ) .	1
9024	Crude population attributable fraction ( PAF ) was calculated after univariate logistic regression analysis to quantify the contribution of the each microorganism to @DISEASE$ occurrence	1
9025	Conceptuality , PAF permits the estimation of the proportional reduction in @DISEASE$ occurrence that would occur if the pathogen was absent ( alternative ideal scenario )	1
9026	The formula was the following :	1
9027	The influence of HCV genotypes on @DISEASE$ recurrence after LT had been assessed , but the results were still controversial	1
9028	Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for @DISEASE$ after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [ 7 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
9029	Another study by Gayowski et al	1
9030	reported in their results that the rate of recurrent @DISEASE$ , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to IF@GENE$ erapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] .	1
9031	The most common radiological feature was @DISEASE$ with consolidation in the Adv group and consolidation in the Non - Adv group ( P < 0	1

9050	The rates of asymptomatic infection with @DISEASE$ vary	1
9051	A serologic study was conducted to determine the asymptomatic @DISEASE$ rate in healthcare workers and non - healthcare workers by exposure status .	1
9052	Among the 3 , 291 selected individuals , the response rates of contacts with super - spreading events ( 5 or more individuals infected ) , contacts with spreaders who infected 1 - 4 individuals , and contacts with non - spreaders were 39	1

9062	The pathology of EV71 - infected mice treated with N3 was examined by immunohistochemical and histological staining	1
9063	Mice were given 200 mg N3 or @GENE$ at 3 h post 1610 5 pfu of 5746 infection	1
9064	The antibody - treated animals were sacrificed and tissue sections were prepared on Day 4 after infection	1
9065	No marked lesions or inflammation were observed in the brain , spinal cord , skin , heart , spleen , lungs , or liver ( data not shown ) of infected mice received N3 treatment	1
9066	In immunochemistry staining with @GENE$ , viral particles did not accumulated in the brainstem ( Fig	1
9067	5A ) and muscles ( Fig	1
9068	5B ) of mice treated with N3 , in contrast to the marked accumulation in the these tissue of mice which did not receive treatment or received only @GENE$	1
9069	The muscle fibers were damaged in the non - treated mice and mice received @GENE$ but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3 , compared to the section of normal muscle tissue ( MOCK ) ( Fig	1
9070	5B )	1
9071	Our previous study had showed that @GENE$ in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [ 11 ]	1
9072	To investigate whether the EV71 - induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not , histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed	1
9073	The result showed that the intestine from the mice received N3 was no damage , compared to massive destruction of the mucosa and @GENE$ in antibody - untreated or isotype antibody - treated mice ( Fig	1
9074	5C ) .	1
9075	Since antibiotic resistance , which is an interdisciplinary global concern , is emerging in an alarmingly increasing manner , the study also aimed to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns for the isolated bacteria	1
9076	Table 1 shows that the S	1

9079	We conclude that administration of @GENE$ as an additional therapy did not have a beneficial effect in patients with severe @DISEASE$ requiring ECMO support .	1
9080	@GENE$ and @GENE$ are conserved across phylogeny from yeast to humans ( Table 1 )	1
9081	Studies in the multicellular filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans were the first to describe a role for @GENE$ in regulating @GENE$ Kelly , 2001 , 2002 )	1
9082	@GENE$ , which is homologous to @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , which is homologous to @GENE$ , were identified in a screen for genes involved in carbon catabolite repression and gene expression	1
9083	Genetic experiments revealed that @GENE$ acts upstream of @GENE$ and that @GENE$ stabilizes @GENE$ by interacting with and preventing proteolysis of the @GENE$ ( Lockington and Kelly , 2002 ) .	1

9085	The survey was conducted under the Chulalongkorn University ' s animal use and care protocol # 1731074	1
9086	The result of this study provided the first detection and genetic characterization of CaKoV isolated from domestic dogs in Thailand .	1
9087	After secretion , @GENE$ signals in an autocrine and paracrine manner by binding to the @GENE$ , which consists of two subunits , @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 138 ]	1
9088	These subunits are associated with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) localized in the cytoplasm ; @GENE$ interacts with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , whereas @GENE$ interacts with @GENE$	1
9089	Ligation of @GENE$ results in activation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , which subsequently phosphorylate @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
9090	Phosphorylated @GENE$ and @GENE$ then form a @GENE$ , which associates with @GENE$ to form @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) that binds to the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in the promoter of many @GENE$ to enhance the transcription of several hundreds of @GENE$ [ 110 , 139 , 140 ]	1
9091	Together , these @GENE$ act to coordinate an antiviral response that is able to inhibit almost any step in the viral life cycle [ 140 ] .	1

9115	Viperin ' s role w@GENE$ e brain during @DISEASE$ was further mapped to certain brain regions , as viperin inhibited viral replication@GENE$ olfactory bulb and cerebrum , but not in the cerebellum or brainstem	1
9116	This correlates very well with @DISEASE$ since viperin strongly inhibited TBEV replicat@GENE$ rimary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum , but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum	1

9118	Accession numbers for all available complete @GENE$ nomes were obtained from the Influenza Research Database [ 45 ] as of June 1 , 2012	1
9119	This list was then compared to those available at FluGenome	1

9123	Using these two accession lists , sequence data were obtained from GenBank [ 47 ]	1
9124	We re@GENE$ nomes from this list , obtaining 3 @GENE$ nomes	1
9125	Because there are few indels in @GENE$ nomes , a simple first - pass alignment algorithm , written in Perl with the BioPerl toolkit [ 48 ] , was used	1
9126	Essentially , we visually picked @GENE$ egion close to the beginning of each of the eight strands o@GENE$ ASE$ genome that appeared mostly conserved	1
9127	The algorithm scanned each set of sequences for this segment and added an appropriate number of spaces to the beginning of each for a rough alignment	1
9128	Using BioEdit [ 49 ] , we simply looked for sequences that were misaligned and inserted gaps where necessary to complete the alignment , paying close attention to codon usage	1
9129	In difficult and ambiguous regions , we chose to minimize the number of changes necessary to produce each variant , similar to the methodology of Carter [ 44 ] .	1

9131	Both assays have led to novel findings that re - enforce the importance of sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques in wildlife disease surveillance studies , where the use of gross lesions and / or less sensitive molecular methods are likely to underestimate pathogen prevalence	1
9132	While all the red squirrel cases suspected of having @DISEASE$ based on gross post - mortem findings were positive for SQPV when assayed using qPCR , an additional case of @DISEASE$ was discovered that had gastrointestinal pathology recorded as the cause of death	1
9133	Similarly , @DISEASE$ have been reported in a single @DISEASE$ red squirrel in Northern Ireland ( Collins et al	1
9134	2014 )	1
9135	Other SQPV - infected red squirrels in this study yielded SQPV in the gastrointestinal tract , with an increase in RQ passing through the gastrointestinal tract potentially indicating replication within the intestine	1
9136	The oropharynx is also reported to be a site of replication in red squirrels ( Fiegna et al	1
9137	2016 ) .	1
9138	The linear range of the assays between the C p value and the log of the @GENE$ for @GENE$ was similar across all assays ( Online Resource S9 , Fig	1
9139	S9	1
9140	1 ) , containing between 10 2 and 10 10 copies of the @GENE$	1
9141	The consistent , reliable limits of detection for the qPCR assays in both red and grey squirrels were estimated to be about 12 ( PGK ) or 6 ( SQPV and SADV ) copies per reaction .	1
9142	Consistent with our first hypothesis , @DISEASE$ infection frequently has been associated with carriage of common @DISEASE$ pathogens	1

9164	However , as the associations found in the above - mentioned studies are based on cross - sectional analyses , we cannot determine whether viruses influenced carriage structure , bacterial carriage influenced host susceptibility to viruses or if bidirectional interactions occurred	1
9165	Prospective studies are required to resolve this temporal ambiguity .	1
9166	The study objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with @DISEASE$ in hospitalized children in Mali .	1

9181	Specifically , the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 ( 67 % ) geographic regions designated by IUCN , with over 90 % of all species distributed in more than one region ( Table S2 )	1

9208	However , we may have missed some cases of @DISEASE$ because human rhinovirus was not included in the applied PCR - protocol .	1
9209	The first observation made in these experiments was that @GENE$ treatment of macrophages enhanced infectivity and virus replication of both strains of JEV ( Fig	1

9212	The second observation was that JEV harvested from NEC had enhanced infectivity for IL - 4 - treated macrophages ( Fig	1

9243	Methods : We retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in a selected population of young @DISEASE$ with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy , who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL )	1
9244	Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid ( significance cut - off ≥ 10 4 colony - forming units / ml ) was used	1
9245	Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates .	1
9246	Background : @DISEASE$ , an emerging @DISEASE$ , is an increasing public health problem across South East Asia and the most common cause of @DISEASE$ in adults in Vietnam	1
9247	Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease .	1
9248	Among children , respiratory symptoms are an attractive target for surveillance	1
9249	These are a prominent feature of many childhood epidemics and an early presentation of diseases like @DISEASE$ , severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , and @DISEASE$ that have recently come to the public ' s attention	1
9250	Unfortunately , @DISEASE$ are also a feature of many common @DISEASE$ , reducing the ability of biosurveillance systems to detect epidemics of greater public health concern	1
9251	What is needed , therefore , is clinical information that is readily accessible and pre - processed in a manner that reflects the severity and aberrancy of @DISEASE$	1
9252	Using such data , discrimination between common @DISEASE$ diseases and more serious @DISEASE$ would be possible .	1
9253	To test the robustness of our methods on a given @GENE$ , we need to provide partial information about the true pseudoknot - free structure as input structure for that sequence	1

9256	com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 This table provides the names , description and values of the energy parameters and functions that we used in our methods	1
9257	The names and definitions are the same as in our original @GENE$ [ 48 ] , and the values were updated based on the work of Andronescu et al	1

9259	These parameters were derived for a temperature of 37 ° C and 1 M salt concentration .	1
9260	To formally assess the dependency of measured prediction accuracy of results of a method on a given set of RNA we use bootstrap confidence intervals , a well - known statistical resampling technique [ 59 , 60 ]	1
9261	Following the recent work of Aghaeepour and Hoos [ 61 ] and Hajiaghayi et al	1
9262	[ 58 ] we calculate the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average @GENE$ as follows	1
9263	For each vector f of @GENE$ ( where , for example , f may be the @GENE$ of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on @GENE$ ) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement , where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f ( | f | ) , and then calculate their average @GENE$	1
9264	These 10 4 calculated average @GENE$ represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f	1
9265	We then report the 2	1
9266	5th and 97	1
9267	5th percentile of this distribution ( i	1
9268	e	1
9269	, the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average @GENE$ calculated above ) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively , and call it the @GENE$ 95 % percentile confidence interval	1
9270	By reporting the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average @GENE$ of a method , A , on a data set , D , we say that we are 95 % confident that the average @GENE$ of method A on data set D is in the reported interval	1
9271	All calculations are performed using the " boot " package of the R statistics software environment [ 62 ] .	1
9272	Here , ' x ' and ' y ' are 2 strings and d ( x , y ) is the distance between ' x ' and ' y ' put as minimal cost of operations to transform ' x ' to ' y '	1

9288	The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors	1

9290	Secondly , additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the @GENE$ formed by Phe353 , Trp354 and Tyr587 in the @GENE$	1
9291	Importantly , in the four variants of @GENE$ this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group	1
9292	Glu111 , Tyr179 and Tyr181 of @GENE$ are not conserved in @GENE$ and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses ( Burmeister et al	1
9293	, 1993 )	1
9294	However , our biochemical and structural data suggest that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus @GENE$	1
9295	Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids .	1
9296	A prospective hospital - based case - control study was implemented in the Pediatric department of Gabriel Touré University Hospital at Bamako , Mali , between July 2011 - December 2012	1
9297	Cases were children with radiologically - confirmed @DISEASE$ ; Controls were hospitalized children without respiratory features , matched for age and period	1
9298	Respiratory specimens , were collected to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria	1
9299	Whole blood was collected from cases only	1
9300	Factors associated with @DISEASE$ were assessed by multivariate logistic regression .	1
9301	Given that @DISEASE$ is a single - stranded RNA virus , we investigated whether the pDC - depe@GENE$  IFNa response was mediat@GENE$ to@GENE$  TLR7 ) , which is highly expressed by pDC ' s , bin@GENE$ l RNA , and is capable of initi@GENE$  IFNa responses in pDC ' s without their direct infection [ 28 ]	1
9302	Mice containing a genetically inacti@GENE$  TLR7 gene [ 29 , 30 ] failed to @GENE$  IFNa responses or to upreg@GENE$  CD69 expression in response to @DISEASE$ infection , whereas genetically matched TLR7 wild type mice sh@GENE$ strong IFNa re@GENE$ es and CD69 upregulation ( Figure 4A , B )	1
9303	Consistent with the results from pDC depletions , @DISEASE$ plasma titers were again not significantly different @GENE$ e absence of TL@GENE$ pression and IFNa production ( Figure 4C )	1
9304	These results are similar to data from @DISEASE$ mice infected with @DISEASE$ , although that study noted slight ( two fold ) increases in virus titers in the absence of type @GENE$ ling [ 31 ] .	1
9305	The overall aim of this review paper is to discuss the scholarly narratives on the politics of disease epidemics by diseases and income level ; Ebola in a low - income setting , Zika in a middle - income setting , and SARS in a high - income setting ( Table 1 )	1
9306	This analysis allowed for the consideration of the role that socioeconomic , geographical , and cultural context might play in the narratives on the attribution of blame and response to disease outbreaks .	1
9307	A @GENE$ is a @GENE$ , which commonly consists of a @GENE$ of an @GENE$ covalently linked to the corresponding @GENE$ of an @GENE$	1
9308	@GENE$ have multiple benefits over traditional @GENE$ due to their greatly reduced size , ease of genetic manipulation , and production of antibodies against @GENE$ [ 14 ]	1
9309	In 1994 , @GENE$ which binds to the @GENE$ cellularly and potently inhibited HIV - 1 replication in scFv immunized cells [ 15 ]	1

9313	Montandon et al	1

9319	The anti - viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNAhydrolyzing a@GENE$  [ 22 ] .	1
9320	The trans - activation of − 2 / − 1 @GENE$ by @GENE$ has intriguing parallels with a recently described translational readthrough event in @GENE$ ( 55 )	1
9321	Here , lowfrequency stop codon readthrough at the end of the @GENE$ appends an additional 22 amino acids to the @GENE$ , generating the @GENE$ which possesses anti - angiogenic activity	1
9322	The readthrough event is promoted by the binding of @GENE$ to a recognition element @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
9323	Similar to @GENE$ , @GENE$ is known to associate with @GENE$ and influence their localization , maturation and function ( 56 )	1
9324	How it acts to stimulate readthrough is unknown , but it is striking that both @GENE$ and the @GENE$ promote their respective recoding events from a similar distance 3 of the @GENE$ , suggesting that they may contact the ribosome directly	1
9325	How they subvert translation likely differs in each case as we were unable to uncover any @GENE$ readthrough activity of the @GENE$ ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .	1
9326	A role for @GENE$ in @GENE$ EASE$ was the first description@GENE$ vator of this process ( 19 )	1

9334	The methods used for risk assessment of expiratory aerosols and gaseous contaminants are also different [ 20 ]	1
9335	Until now , studies on the effects of human movement on aerosols transmission and infection risk distribution are still rare	1
9336	In this work , the effects of human movement on @DISEASE$ transmission are investigated	1
9337	An in - flight outbreak case is used for investigation	1
9338	A manikin with a detailed human profile is also used in the computational geometry	1
9339	The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols	1
9340	The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using quantitative risk analysis , and the influence of human movement on @DISEASE$ transmission is also analyzed	1
9341	Likelihood analysis is then performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and the different human movement pattern assumptions .	1

9343	Antibiotic resistance has also developed in Hong Kong [ 1 , 2 ]	1
9344	The serotype 19A is especially virulent and may be difficult to isolate in patients who have already been started on antibiotics	1
9345	The pathogen has been reported to be associated with the @DISEASE$ [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]	1
9346	Penicillin can be used in sensitive pneumococcus [ 1 , 2 ]	1
9347	In patient with @DISEASE$ not responding satisfactory initially , more invasive investigative / therapeutic management including a pleural drain for biologic specimen is indicated to guide management	1
9348	Local antimicrobial sensitivity in @DISEASE$ patients has been reported [ 1 , 2 ]	1
9349	The pathogen was sensitive to penicillin and cefotaxime in this case	1
9350	In patients not responding satisfactorily with initial antibiotics but with known penicillin sensitivity , a higher dose of penicillin should be tried .	1
9351	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a @GENE$ , which is crucial for the activation of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and many other @GENE$ including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 9 ]	1
9352	As an upstream regulator of @GENE$ , @GENE$ signaling is thought to play a key role in @DISEASE$ cell growth , survival and @DISEASE$ angiogenesis [ 10 , 11 ]	1
9353	Studies have shown high levels of act@GENE$ d PDK1 in a large percentage of common @DISEASE$ types , including @DISEASE$ [ 12 ]	1
9354	When activated in @DISEASE$ cells , Akt also has multiple effects that promote disease progress@GENE$ , including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of @DISEASE$ cell proliferation , metabolism , and angiogenesis [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
9355	Thus , the PDK1 / Akt signaling pathway represents an attractive target@GENE$ he development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of @DISEASE$	1
9356	However , the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear	1
9357	Here , we explore the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and the intracellular signals involved in this process	1

9359	Quarantining and travel advisories reflect the profound ethical and political implications inherent in responding to @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
9360	The evidence on the efficacy of the two primary responses - quarantining and travel advisorieswas inadequate to justify the extent of their implementation .	1
9361	Conclusion : This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection	1
9362	Moreover , the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets , even with a high background of DNA , here demonstrated , highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection .	1
9363	For the management of @DISEASE$ in different stages of its evolution , we propose a comprehensive approach that involves producers , the nutrition industry , veterinarians , the diagnostic laboratory , and researchers ( Fig	1
9364	3 )	1
9365	The absence of a well - identified etiology of @DISEASE$ and of an effective alternative to antimicrobials requires a close collaboration between the different stakeholders to reduce antibiotic resistance and economic losses caused by this disease in swine .	1

9379	In all source control scenarios the ventilation level was set to be 4 lps pp , which was defined as base ventilation rate in cases when ventilation must handle only human bio - effluent emissions ( carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) and moisture ) by work done in HealthVent to define the health based ventilation requirements [ 26 ] .	1
9380	The availability of description for characteristics in a particular set of entries from databases is a major factor determining how well names designed with @GENE$ match expectation	1
9381	The amount and accuracy of annotation in sequence databases vary markedly between entries that has been a major concern for the bioinformatics community continuously working toward improving this critical aspect of sequence databases [ 7 , 8 , 27 ]	1
9382	Involving other researchers in this effort , especially those who submit original sequence annotation in the first place , could accelerate the process	1
9383	We hope that through using @GENE$ service , researchers could see immediate benefits from better annotation for their research that may create impetus for contributing quality annotation to public databases	1
9384	To improve the user experience with @GENE$ , we plan to expand the diversity of databases and templates upon future upgrades of @GENE$	1
9385	Any template that the users designed and considered useful could be included in the future @GENE$ releases .	1
9386	The monthly distribution of @DISEASE$ infections and meteorological data are shown in Figure 4	1
9387	The monthly number of @DISEASE$ infections was positively correlated with relative humidity in the Spearman ' s correlation analysis , but not with temperature or rainfall ( Table 3 )	1
9388	The same association with relative humidity was seen for hMPV	1
9389	In contrast , the number of PIV3 was positively associated with both temperature and rainfall , and not with relative@GENE$ dity	1
9390	InfA did not correlate with any of these meteorological fact@GENE$  while InfB showed moderate negative correlation with all three factors .	1
9391	Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the Hexaplex Plus assay [ 15 ] , we may have underestimated the number of @DISEASE$	1
9392	Viral load in a specimen depends on several conditions , such as time of collection in relation to onset of illness	1
9393	In most of the study children , the NPA specimen was collected early in the course of illness , which increases the likelihood of detecting an infectious agent [ 14 ]	1
9394	Moreover , by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours , we primarily recruited new cases of @DISEASE$	1
9395	Using multiplex instead of single molecular assays may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of @DISEASE$ cases , as some loss of sensitivity is an inherent limitation of multiplex PCR assays [ 13 ] .	1
9396	EPKVA > 500 APN , we next evaluated the ability of cyc - LHSPW to preferentially bind to cells that express @GENE$ EASE$ using flow cytometry ( Fig	1
9397	5B )	1
9398	For flow cytometry , we synthesized a fluorophore - containing version of the peptide possessing a ( Gly ) 4 - FITC group coupled to the C - terminal cysteine ( Supplemental Figure 4 )	1
9399	The expressi@GENE$ d APN was examined in the androgen receptor negative @DISEASE$ cell lines PC3 and DU145 using a commercially available antibody	1
9400	The cell line PC3 was found to express surface - assoc@GENE$ tectable expression was found for the DU145 cell line by this method	1
9401	When incubated with both cells lines , the FITC labeled cyc - LHSPW peptide preferentially bound to PC3 cells with no noticeable labelling of DU145 cells	1
9402	The peptide was next tested on frozen PC3 and DU145 @DISEASE$ xenografts sections	1
9403	Preferential labeling of the PC3 xenograft section was evident , furthering attesting to the specificity of cyc - LHSPW by fluorescence microscopy	1
9404	The potential therapeutic efficacy of cyc - LHSPW was next tested in vitro using the PC3 and DU145 cell lines	1
9405	The @DISEASE$ i@GENE$ itor demonstrated a specific and pronounced therapeutic benefit resulting in the decreased clonal survival of PC3 cells	1
9406	No significant biological effect was observed on either cell line after treatment with the hydrolyzable LHSPW peptide or the cyc - nHSPW derivative	1

9432	We have developed an approach to UV - based sterilization using single - wavelength far - UVC light generated by filtered excilamps , which selectively inactivate microorganisms , but does not produce biological damage to exposed mammalian cells and tissues [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
9433	The approach is based on biophysical principles in that far - UVC light can traverse and therefore inactivate bacteria and viruses which are typically micrometer dimensions or smaller , whereas due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer dead - cell layers of human skin , nor the outer tear layer on the surface of the eye .	1
9434	Variability in the immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of ODN 2216 on feline cells was mainly related to the age of the cats	1
9435	Among middle - aged adult cats , consistency in the stimulatory potential of this molecule was reflected through the highly similar patterns in gene expression profiles induced in immune cells after stimulation , as well as through the moderate deviations in those experiments aiming to characterize the immunomodulatory properties of ODN 2216 ( Figure 1 )	1
9436	The cells of several animals however , in particular @GENE$ , but also @GENE$ and @GENE$ , indicated particularly strong responsiveness to stimulation throughout the study	1
9437	Such observations are most likely linked to the genetic variability of individuals of an outbred species , as inherited factors are known to play an important role in the magnitude of innate immune responses [ 69 ]	1
9438	With respect to this observation , it should be noted that the SPF origin and maintenance in a barrier facility of the animals included in this study may slightly lower the variability in strength and breadth of innate immune responses , and studies with cells obtained from field cats would give further information on divergence in response to stimulation of the innate immune cells of individual animals	1
9439	The immune cells of cats of 14 years of age seemed to respond slightly less well to ODN 2216 than those of younger adult animals , while PBMCs of kittens indicated much more reticence to stimulation , with either limited or absent upregulation of both @GENE$ and other genes measured after incubation with ODN 2216	1
9440	Stimulated PBMCs from this group of young animals moreover indicated a tendency to develop an immunologic environment with a Th2 orientation , including higher production of @GENE$ and impaired induction of @GENE$ compared to cells from adult cats	1
9441	Although the kittens included in this study were already of 10 weeks of age , these observations strongly corroborate the immature IFN system of neonatal mice [ 70 ] , the impaired immune cell activation via @GENE$ in human neonatal mononuclear cells [ 71 , 72 ] and the bias towards Th2 rather than Th1 responses in human fetuses and neonates [ 73 , 74 ]	1
9442	Furthermore , concordantly to findings in human neonatal blood [ 75 , 76 ] , basal @GENE$ transcription in kit indicated levels similar to those of adults	1
9443	However , ODN 2216 stimulation increased mRNA expression of this gene only in the young animals ( Figure 2C )	1
9444	These results open new perspectives on possible explanations for the qualitative discrepancy between innate immune responses in newborns and adults	1
9445	The availability of specific antibodies to feline TLR9 would greatly support further investigations in this direction .	1
9446	In addition to the methods to determine the chain - breaking antioxidant activity , there are also the remaining methods for evaluating the capacity for scavenging other free radicals such as superoxide , hydroxyl , nitric oxide , peroxynitrite or for chelating metals ( secondary antioxidants )	1
9447	Many methods have been developed and compiled in recent review articles , being also in some of them reported the advantages and disadvantages of those methods [ 27 , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]	1
9448	The antioxidant ability of the essential oils has also been evaluated using several methods	1
9449	A recent review discusses the diversity of tests used by different authors for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils [ 5 ] .	1
9450	Felids are frequently affected by four viruses of different families : the feline @DISEASE$ ( FHV ) , @DISEASE$ ( FCV ) , @DISEASE$ ( FPV ) and @DISEASE$ ( FCoV )	1
9451	Although these viruses cannot productively infect purified PBMCs in vitro , they share the ability to induce cytopathic effects ( CPE ) in CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells	1
9452	These feline cell lines , however , do not alter their mRNA levels of genes selected as markers for innate immunity upon direct treatment with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown ) , preventing from assessing the potential of this molecule to inhibit viral replication directly in these cells	1
9453	Thus , CrFK and fcwf - 4 cells were incubated , prior to their inoculation , with the cell - free supernatants of PBMCs mentioned above : Sup 221@GENE$ Sup 224@GENE$ d Sup Neg@GENE$ is aim , supernatants derived from PBMCs treated for 24 h were selected , as Sup 221@GENE$ oduced by the cells of several adult cats were estimated to contain optimal type I @GENE$  at this time point , according to the induction of Mx tran@GENE$ iption measured directly in these immune cells ( Figure 4A and 4B )	1
9454	CrFK and fcwf - 4 target cells were then incubated with the supernatants for 24 h before inoculation , as this time span had indicated highest induction of antiviral mechanisms ( Figure 4F )	1
9455	The antiviral effects of the supernatants were initially tested on @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) as control , as this virus is widely recognized for both its potential to induce CPE in cell lines of multiple species and for its particularly high sensitivity to the effects of type I IFN [ 65 , @GENE$  the Sup 2216 derived f@GENE$ BMCs of eight adult cats that had broadly responded to in vitro ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2B and C , groups 2 and 3 ) were incubated with fcwf - 4 cells prior to their inoculation , significant inhibition of @DISEASE$ replication was observed ( p = 0	1
9456	0039 ) ( Figure 5A )	1
9457	The replication of this virus was also to some degree re by Sup 2243 ( p = 0	1
9458	0078 ) , an observation Table 1 )	1
9459	Both Sup 2243 and Sup Neg failed to inhibit replication of this heterogeneous group of feline viruses , underlining the essential role of the 2216 molecule in conferring the observed effects	1
9460	Importantly , cells stimulated with ODN 2216 directly did not indicate any resistance to viral replication , in concordance to their impaired response to this molecule already measured on a genetic level ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown )	1
9461	With respect to the younger cats , the Sup 2216 of those 2 kittens whose cells responded to ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2A , group 1 ) could also inhibit both VSV and FCV on fcwf - 4 cells , while the supernatants derived from the PBMCs of the other 2 kittens indicated no inhibition potential on these viruses ( Figure 5K and L )	1
9462	Altogether , the viral suppression potential of Sup 2216 from all the cats could be compared to that conferred by treatment of the cells with 10 to 100U rfeIFNα , a quantity determined in titration experiments of rfeIFNα conducted together with the viral inhibition assays ( data not shown ) .	1
9463	By contrast , we have earlier shown that far - UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range , efficiently inactivates drug - resistant bacteria , without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
9464	The biophysical reason is that , due to its strong absorbance in biological materials , far - UVC light does not have sufficient range to penetrate through even the outer layer ( stratum corneum ) on the surface of human skin , nor the outer tear layer on the outer surface of the eye , neither of which contain living cells ; however , because bacteria and viruses are typically of micron or smaller dimensions , far - UVC light can still efficiently traverse and inactivate them [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .	1
9465	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , together with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , is a member of the genus @DISEASE$ within the family Flaviviridae and an important pathogen of pigs that often causes huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide	1

9468	Reads were demultiplexed according to barcode and quality filtered using TrimGalore [ 63 , 64 ] with a quality threshold of 25 , minimum read length of 75 bp , and clipping the first 14 bp of the read	1
9469	Low complexity reads were filtered out using the DUST method and PCR duplicates removed using PRINSEQ [ 65 ]	1
9470	We screened cleaned reads for the Bartonella genotypes detected in this study using nucleotide BLAST [ 66 ] against a custom database composed of the @GENE$ from this study , retaining only the best alignment ( the @GENE$ with the lowest e - value ) for a single query - subject pair	1
9471	To investigate the presence of Bartonella species other than genotypes detected in blood samples from vampire bats , cleaned reads were de novo assembled into contigs using the assembly only function of @GENE$ [ 67 ]	1
9472	Individual reads and contigs were screened for sequences matching Bartonella using protein alignment in Diamond [ 68 ] , and close matches at the protein level were further characterized by nucleotide BLAST against the @GENE$	1
9473	As the @GENE$ is not highly transcribed , we also tested sequences for matches to @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
9474	We selected two @GENE$ ( Genbank accessions KY629892 and KY629911 ) from a study of vampire bat Bartonella [ 16 ] for which the same individuals exhibited 100 % identity in the @GENE$ to our blood sequences , and we used @GENE$ to map quality filtered reads and contigs to those sequences [ 69 ] .	1
9475	Induction of functional humoral responses in C57BL / 6 mice by the @GENE$ DNA vaccine The ability of the consensus ZIKV - prME vaccine to induce humoral immune responses in mice was evaluated	1

9478	) through electroporation - mediated delivery three times at 2 - week intervals with 25 μg of either the @GENE$ or the @GENE$	1
9479	Sera was obtained from each immunized mouse and tested by ELISA for @GENE$ responses using immobilised @GENE$ as the @GENE$	1
9480	A significant increase in @GENE$ was observed on day 21 with a further boost in the sera @GENE$ levels noted on day 35 ( Figure 3a )	1

9497	( e ) Plaque - reduction neutralisation ( PRNT ) assay analysis of neutralising antibodies induced by ZIKV - prME immunisation	1
9498	The serum samples from the ZIKV - prME immunised mice were tested for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro	1
9499	PRNT 50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50 % of the input virus	1
9500	The values in parentheses indicate the PRNT 50	1

9503	elevated ZIKV - specific antibody responses were maintained long term following the final boost	1
9504	Most importantly , sera from vaccinated mice contained very high levels of rZIKV - E - specific antibodies as indicated by the endpoint titres ( Figure 3b )	1
9505	Additional assessment of the specificity of the vaccine - induced antibodies was performed by screening pooled sera from ZIKV - prME plasmid inoculated mice for its ability to detect rZIKV - E by western analysis ( Figure 3c ) and to stain ZIKV ( MR766 strain ) infected cells in an immunofluorescence assay ( Figure 3d )	1
9506	The results from both these analyses confirmed specificity of the vaccine - induced humoral responses .	1
9507	Based on the apparent energy consumption data , a systematic and comprehensive city - level total carbon accounting approach was established and applied in Guangzhou , China	1
9508	A newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector	1
9509	Research results are listed as follow : ( 1 ) Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou .	1
9510	Iterative HFold is comprised of four different iterative methods	1
9511	Following the description of each method , we motivate why we chose to include it as part of our overall algorithm	1
9512	Iterative HFold takes as input both an @GENE$ , @GENE$ and a pseudoknot - free secondary structure , G ; later we show that structure G can be produced by computational methods , for example , @GENE$ or SimFold suboptimal structures , when only the sequence @GENE$ is initially available .	1
9513	To date , only few in vi vo studies have been reported with @GENE$ - @GENE$ conjugates [ 98 ]	1
9514	In the field of antivirals , Pandey and colleagues have started preliminary toxicity , immunological and pharmacokinetic studies in mice for the @GENE$ [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ]	1
9515	Chaubey et a l	1
9516	reported the non - toxicity of the complex when administered at repeat doses ranging up to 100 mg / kg [ 99 ]	1
9517	Mice which were given 100 mg / kg of the conjugate , a dose the authors highlight is far in excess of the expected therapeutic dose , suffered from @DISEASE$ and reduced physical activity and from @DISEASE$	1
9518	However they recovered during the 60 - day follow - up period with no irreversible @DISEASE$ damage reported .	1
9519	The following studies have harnessed the carrier capability of the @GENE$ and 9R peptides to shuttle potential @GENE$ into virus - infected cells	1
9520	To our knowledge , the first report of the successful use of @GENE$ to deliver potential antiviral agents into cells is by Vocero - Akbani et al	1
9521	in 1999 [ 103 ]	1
9522	In their elegant study , the authors took a novel approach to specifically kill HIV - infected cells thereby preventing the production of infectious virions	1
9523	They engineered a zymogen form of the apoptosis - promoting enzyme @GENE$ that , upon entry into @DISEASE$ - infected cells , would be processed into its active form b@GENE$ tease ( Figure 1 )	1
9524	To deliver this mod@GENE$ e - 3 into Jurkat T cells , they arme@GENE$ otein with the tat peptide at its N - terminal	1
9525	The authors showed that they could transduce about 100 % of cells in less than 20 min	1
9526	Confocal analysis localized FITC - la@GENE$ e - 3 to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments	1
9527	@GENE$ e - 3 remained inactive in uninfected cells , its uptake resulted in massive apoptosis in @DISEASE$ - infected Jurkat T cells	1
9528	Although a very promising study , no further or follow - up investigations have been reported .	1
9529	Methods : BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure	1
9530	The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell ( WBC ) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between @DISEASE$ were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis .	1
9531	Fecal Consistency Scale scores were available for only 4 ( 31 % ) cats fed Diet A and 10 ( 67 % ) cats fed Diet B	1
9532	The model of FCS against day and diet over the 4 weeks showed no significant differences between the diets in the change in fecal score ( p > 0	1
9533	05 )	1
9534	There was no correlation between the frequency of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ over the 4 - week period and the presence of fecal enteropathogens detected via PCR or antibody testing ( p > 0	1
9535	05 )	1
9536	Similarly , neither Spec fPL results nor age of the cat correlated with the frequency of @DISEASE$ over the 4 - week period ( p > 0	1

9540	Focusing on shared threats that lead to both bat population declines and disease emergence will allow for a common research agenda and can serve to bring together bat conservationists and @DISEASE$ experts	1
9541	While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step , assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host - virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts , such as humans or domestic animals , is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives	1
9542	Host - virus [ 21 ] and network websites .	1
9543	@DISEASE$ are responsible for 25 % of the annual global deaths ( Dry and Leach 2010 )	1
9544	Epidemics arising from these diseases are unpredictable , carry uncertain , varying risks , and narratives in different contexts ( Scoones 2010 )	1
9545	It is important that the scholarly literature represents the diverse and sometimes competing , narratives from all affected particularly the most vulnerable ( Dry and Leach 2010 )	1
9546	Arguably , national and global responses to epidemics are inherently political	1
9547	The experts selected for consultation , the evidence used to inform response pathways , and narratives of blame , vulnerability , and responsibility are politically driven , and require analysis .	1
9548	Blow flies prefer to lick animal carcasses and droppings	1
9549	If food for blow flies is contaminated by pathogens , the flies might ingest significant numbers of pathogens	1
9550	One possible mechanism for mechanical transmission of pathogens by blow flies is regurgitation and the feces on the food source [ 13 , 14 ]	1
9551	The effectiveness of mechanical transmission through regurgitation may depend on the viability and titer of pathogens in the fly ' s body	1
9552	The accumulated droppings at a poultry farm should be a good breeding site for blow flies	1
9553	If the flies reproduced at a poultry farm , they should have many opportunities for contact with viruses in the feces of infected chickens and / or their dead bodies .	1

9572	Background : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) belong to a family of highly related @GENE$ that have been shown to interfere with a large spectrum of viruses including Filoviruses , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
9573	In all these cases , the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM prote@GENE$ target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded .	1
9574	In Germany , influenza sentinel surveillance on outpatients of all ages [ 17 ] confirmed that the first postpandemic season 2010 / 11 was dominated by @GENE$ ( 62 % ) , co - circulating with influenza B ( 37 % ) whereas @GENE$ was rare ( < 1 % )	1
9575	During the second season 2011 / 12 , @GENE$ was rare ( 1 % ) , whereas @GENE$ was diagnosed in 75 % of cases and co - circulated with @DISEASE$ ( 24 % )	1
9576	In the third season 2012 / 13 , all three types / subtypes co - circulated in similar proportions ( 34 % A @GENE$ 31 % A @GENE$ H3@GENE$ , and 35 % B ) .	1
9577	Based on the highest risk contact for each participant , seven ( 20	1
9578	6 % ) of the responders were classified as Grade 1 ; they were partially protected with at least gloves and an N95 respirator ( Table 1 )	1
9579	They contacted asymptomatic or symptomatic patients , and symptomatic patients wore surgical masks	1
9580	After @DISEASE$ had been confirmed in a patient , all staff were fully protected when in contact with the patient	1
9581	The closest contact occurred when touching and holding patients during transport	1
9582	One responder wearing full PPE had a mild @DISEASE$ ( 37	1
9583	5 ° C ) after contact with a symptomatic patient who was later confirmed as infected	1
9584	Since the response system had not expanded in the early days of the outbreak , she was not tested but was isolated with self - monitoring .	1

9587	The solution for the threshold under this approximation is where @GENE$ · ) denotes the @GENE$ cumulative distribution function for a @GENE$ .	1
9588	The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the significance attached to @DISEASE$ from the public health perspective	1
9589	This trend is due in part to the emergence of new and highly pathogenic infections such as @DISEASE$ [ 1 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 2 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 3 ]	1
9590	There are also wellpublicized concerns surrounding the deliberate introduction of pathogens as bioterrorism weapons [ 4 , 5 ] , and the continued persistence and resurgence of older infections , several of which now boast strains resistant to more than one drug [ 6 ]	1
9591	In addition , there have been a number of high - profile and economically expensive disease outbreaks in domestic livestock [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] as well as wildlife populations [ 10 ] .	1
9592	Rodentia is the largest mammalian order and is comprised of about 1 , 800 species [ 10 ]	1
9593	Only a few dozen species have been identified as susceptible hosts , and most hantaviruses are hosted by a single rodent species [ 11 ]	1
9594	In each hantavirus / rodent reservoir relationship , infection results in two prominent features : no conspicuous pathology and persistent infection [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
9595	The earliest report of experimental infection of a reservoir host with its hantavirus was by Lee et al	1
9596	[ 15 ] that described infection of striped field mice ( Apodemus agrarius ) with @DISEASE$	1
9597	Inoculated mice developed chronic infection with transient @DISEASE$ , and shed virus principally in urine , saliva and , to a lesser extent , feces , despite the production of ne@GENE$ 	1
9598	Individual components in a workflow may be designated to run on different computing servers in a cluster by simply specifying a corresponding condition in Quascade	1
9599	This provides a straightforward approach of constructing workflows that execute in a high - performance environment	1
9600	In turn , a component running on a given server may use several computing nodes to execute its program , thereby providing a two - tiered mechanism of distributed processing	1
9601	As an example , Figure 8 shows a physical workflow and its graphical counterpart	1
9602	The workflow consists of a sample generator component , which generates / collects data , an @GENE$ component which performs the actual processing , and a sample sink component which ' consumes ' the processed data in terms of not forwarding the data further to another component	1
9603	While the genera - tor and sink components can be connected to external entities , i	1
9604	e	1
9605	physical devices , the @GENE$ component may be a simple single - node program or a complex , parallel multi - node application .	1
9606	The @GENE$ component is modified to break up its output file ' s data into several data sets , which are written to a buffered output port	1
9607	Distribution of files is then implemented by using a @GENE$ ( Demux ) component and a result combining module ( @GENE$ )	1
9608	More technical details about the file distribution and concatenation as well as other workflow parameters can be found elsewhere [ 23 ]	1
9609	The model , design and implementation used to distribute the distance - based workflow can also be applied to parallelize the parsimony and the ML based workflows	1
9610	The usage of the model and design developed for the @GENE$ component has therefore been used for the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ components	1
9611	The corresponding workflows are shown in Figure 1 , 2 , and 3	1

9629	In biopsy samples taken from cases with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ with a severe @DISEASE$ were found without the presence of amastigotes , but with a positive quantitative @DISEASE$ PCR [ 62 ] .	1
9630	The pathological mechanism by which MIA causes @DISEASE$ in offspring is completely unknown , however we speculate that the following steps may be involved 29 , 70	1
9631	@DISEASE$ activates fetal microglia during the acute phase , and subsequently , microglia also activate astrocytes	1
9632	In the chronic phase , microglial activation is attenuated , while astrocytes are continuously activated 29	1
9633	Both microglia and astrocytes are important for normal neurodevelopment , however under @DISEASE$ , they are activated , their function is altered , and they have an adverse effect on neurons and axons , with the overproduction of pro - inflammatory cytokines 34	1
9634	Infla@GENE$ ion also prevents the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells , followed by a reduction of the oligodendrocyte lineage 71 , 72	1
9635	This reduction leads to axonal loss	1
9636	The neuronal and axonal damage caused by microglia or astrocytes in the developing brain would result in the abnormal behavioral features in later life	1
9637	In our model , we have previously reported over - activation of fetal microglia 8 h after the LPS insult 12 , and the present study demonstrated that activation of astrocytes continued even ~ 5 weeks after the insult	1
9638	Moreover , the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes were reduced in the amygdala and white matter , respectively	1
9639	We have previously reported that H 2 has a suppressive effect on microglial activation 12 , and the present study demonstrated that H 2 had a similar effect on astrocytes , as described above	1
9640	From these findings , we speculate that H 2 would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes indirectly via suppression of the over - activation of immune cells , including microglia and astrocytes , which would result in a reduction of the @DISEASE$ present in @DISEASE$ offspring	1
9641	However , in this study , a direct effect of H 2 on neurons and oligodendrocytes was not evaluated in vitro , thus , this possibility cannot be excluded .	1
9642	Based on these studies , cats are apparently less susceptible than dogs [ 47 , 48 ] to the development of disease after established experimental infection with species of the L	1
9643	donovani complex or are even resistant to infection [ 15 ] .	1
9644	Species , strains , isolates and genetic variants of Leishmania spp	1
9645	found in cats have been characterized by means of laboratory procedures including electrophoresis of @GENE$ upon parasite cultivation , @GENE$ and molecular methods	1
9646	The latter mainly comprise conventional and real time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) combined with @GENE$ analysis , restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) or hybridization of amplified products with specific probes ( Table 1 ) .	1
9647	@DISEASE$ reinfection of the graft is almost universal among recipients with active infections at the time of transplantation [ 52 ]	1
9648	An accelerated progression of @DISEASE$ is noted in those recipients with recurrent @DISEASE$ after transplant , and at least 25 to 30 % of patients will eventually develop @DISEASE$ within 5 to 10 years [ 53 , 54 ]	1
9649	Once @DISEASE$ is established , the first episode of decompensation may occur in as high as 40 % of patients within 1 year	1
9650	Apart from the rapid progression of @DISEASE$ , recipients with recurrent @DISEASE$ may also develop severe @DISEASE$ , characterized by @DISEASE$ , rapidly after organ transplantation in the absence of @DISEASE$ causing a very high risk of @DISEASE$ failure [ 55 ]	1
9651	For the reason , HCV - related recipients show a worse posttransplant outcome compared to HCV - negative recipients	1
9652	A previous study which retrospectively analyzed 11036 patients with 11791 liver transplants confirmed that the @DISEASE$ infection significantly impaired patient and graft survival after LT [ 56 ]	1
9653	Focusing on the strategy to recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT , three approaches have been identified according to the timing of treatment : pretransplantation antiviral therapy , posttransplantation prevention and preemptive treatment , and treatment for established reinfection	1
9654	[ 58 ]	1
9655	It is noteworthy that none of the patients who achieved SVR before LT developed graft reinfection in the study	1
9656	In addition to the relative poor efficacy , safety of pegylated IFN is another @GENE$ ients with @DISEASE$	1
9657	Carrion et al	1
9658	reported that 43 % , 29 % , and 8 % of patients suffered from discontinuation , decompensation , and death during therapy [ 57 ]	1
9659	Although the incidence of decompensation and death is similar in comparison to control group , treated patients suffered from a significantly higher rate of @DISEASE$ than control group	1
9660	Child - Pugh B / C is the only independent factor associated with @DISEASE$	1
9661	These data suggested that patients with @DISEASE$ should be closely monitored during Pegylated IFN therapy and followed by experts with considerable experienc@GENE$ ing antivirals ( DAAs ) , including protease , polymerase or other nonstructural protein inhibitors , are the@GENE$ ve@GENE$ s for HCV@GENE$ ata on HCV treatment using DAA are limited in patients with cirrhosis	1
9662	In the phase III trials with telaprevir and boceprevir , there were only a few patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis included [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]	1
9663	Although the results from the phase III trials of telaprevir and boceprevir triple therapy showed a higher SVR rates compared to Pegylated IFN / RBV therapy in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic patients , the severe advanced events rates were also increased in patients receiving triple therapy	1
9664	The data from compassionate use of protease inhibitors in viral C cirrhosis ( CUPIC ) cohort also demonstrated an increased serious adverse events rates ( from 30 % to 51 % ) and discontinuation rates ( from 7 % to 12 % ) in cirrhotic nonresponders compared to the phase III trials	1
9665	Another study in 20 cirrhotic patients awaiting LT demonstrated that 71 % of patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks with DAA triple therapy	1
9666	However , 25 % of patients suffered from early discontinuation , and 10 % of patients had decompensation during therapy	1
9667	The results suggest that triple therapy must be administered cautiously with intensive safety monitoring in cirrhotic patients .	1
9668	H9N2 virus concentration and purification were carried out according to Hutchinson and Fodor [ 31 ] .	1
9669	Titration of infectivity was carried out by a standard tissue culture infectious dose 50 % ( TCID 50 ) assay using MDCK cells	1
9670	The presence of viral infection was determined at 72 h pi , by optical assessment of cytopathic effects coupled with a hemagglutination assay ( HA )	1
9671	The titer was determined by the Reed and Muench method [ 24 ]	1
9672	The limit of detection was of 20 TCID 50 / 0	1
9673	1 g of tissue .	1
9674	To also explore spatial dynamics at smaller scales , we further partition large geographical regions that are administratively coherent , such as the USA , China , Japan and Australia , resulting in 26 global sampling regions ( Text S1 )	1
9675	In this analysis , air travel again predicts viral movement ( posterior probability	1
9676	0	1
9677	99 and Bayes factor	1
9678	18000 ) , but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations ( posterior probability = 0	1
9679	76 and Bayes factor = 87 ) , and , less intuitively , with origin and destination population densities ( although the size of the latter effects are weaker , Fig	1
9680	2 )	1
9681	The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely , per capita , to occur out of , or into , dense subpopulations .	1
9682	Nursing managers are widely accepted as the most influential force in staff satisfaction and retention because of their role in work environments	1
9683	Hospital management protects and provides staff with the resources to do their job	1
9684	Within the clinical settings , managers are consistent in their presence ; uniquely positioned with a front - row view of the intricacies of nurse - patient , nurse - physician , and nurse - interdisciplinary team dynamics	1
9685	Hospitals , together with nursing managers , are expected to oversee the daily demands of unit operations while developing an environment that fosters nursing excellence and promotes an engaged nursing staff	1
9686	On the other hand , nursing managers are the vital link between hospital senior executives and direct care nurses	1
9687	Good management makes a hospital meet its complex target	1
9688	Below are the comments made by the participants :	1
9689	Our biggest concern is that the @DISEASE$ wards are perpetuating the spread of infection	1
9690	The management promised us that they will build new @DISEASE$ wards that are well ventilated , that have good airflow , fans and regularly serviced UV lights as well as big windows and patients ' waiting area to allow airflow	1
9691	The wards will have nursing station and there will be a demarcation between @DISEASE$ , MDR - TB and @DISEASE$	1
9692	We really need those wards because we are not safe here	1
9693	"	1
9694	where I i ¼ 1 if farm i is infected and zero otherwise , and b is the transmission rate	1
9695	Infected farms recover after a period T and cannot be reinfected	1
9696	We aim to investigate spread of relatively ' fast - moving ' diseases in the absence of movement restrictions such as @DISEASE$	1
9697	We make the assumption that transmission of infection to a farm results in all animals on that farm moving into the infectious class	1
9698	Given this assumption , the risk of infection between any pair of nodes in the movement network is based upon the number of movements between them rather than the number of animals moved	1
9699	In order to investigate the impact of epidemiological parameters upon model predictions , we explore a range of values for the transmission parameter and the infectious period , such that b ¼ 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and T ¼ 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 days .	1
9700	Using S min for each of the sampling methods , we find that SBS captures the main epidemic hotspots well , but slightly overestimates epidemic sizes in these hotspots	1
9701	RMS also performs well , but slightly underestimates epidemic sizes	1
9702	The TNS method proves an accurate predictor of epidemic sizes in all the most infected counties , with 8	1
9703	7 and 13	1

9705	Management of feline @DISEASE$ has included intervention with both veterinary therapeutic formulas designed to manage non - specific @DISEASE$ and those designed with limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredients for management of food - responsive enteropathies and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
9706	There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline @DISEASE$	1
9707	This prospective , multi - center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non - specific @DISEASE$ in 28 cats with a history of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$	1
9708	The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of @DISEASE$ ( n = 25 ) , with a smaller number having a history of concurrent @DISEASE$ ( n = 2 ) or @DISEASE$ alone ( n = 3 )	1
9709	Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any @DISEASE$ that could be associated with the clinical signs of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , and if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a Spec fPL ≥ 5	1

9711	Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks	1
9712	Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a num@GENE$ reduction in the number of @DISEASE$ episodes over the 4 - week period , but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions	1
9713	When looking within dietary groups , significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69	1

9727	Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline @DISEASE$	1
9728	Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2 - to 4 - week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease .	1

9730	Toronto experienced the largest outbreak of @DISEASE$ in North America , with investigation of 2 , 132 potential cases and identification of 23 , 103 contacts of @DISEASE$ patients who required quarantine [ 11 ]	1
9731	Post - SARS investigations have detected myriad adverse effects among those quarantined : significant feelings of uncertainty , anxiety , and isolation [ 14 ] ; experience of stigma , fear , and frustration [ 15 ] ; symptoms of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 16 ] ; and loss of anonymity [ 17 ] .	1
9732	The inhibition of activity or expression of @GENE$ by some anti - inflammatory is due to the interference with the signalling mechanisms that regulate the @GENE$	1
9733	In this gene , four @GENE$ including @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) have been identified as regulators of @GENE$ transcription [ 22 , 126 ]	1

9735	In several studies , @DISEASE$ and overexpression of genes encoding immunoglobul@GENE$ ied in patients with @DISEASE$ [ 6 , 16 , 17 ]	1
9736	Therefore , IVIG treatment could be a logical requirement in these patients	1
9737	We included IVIG therapy in our @DISEASE$ patients based on these considerations , although we did not measure immunoglob@GENE$ ore treatment	1
9738	Indeed , in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients , high IgG levels@GENE$ e associated with high mortality in @DISEASE$ patients [ 18 ]	1
9739	PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to IgM in @GENE$ blood of patients with @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
9740	IgM @GENE$ ls remain low in non - surviving @DISEASE$ patients , whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [ 20 ]	1
9741	Single studies and metaanalyses have shown beneficial effects of IVIG therapy in patients with @DISEASE$ [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]	1
9742	However , IVIG treatment remains controversial	1
9743	Randomized studies have not shown any beneficial effect of this intervention in patients with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ [ 8 ]	1
9744	Therefore , IVIG therapy is not currently recommended in the latest @DISEASE$ guidelines [ 24 ] .	1

9752	Wildlife disease surveillance thus forms an essential part of the ' One Health ' theme ( Thompson 2013 ) , with studies providing an opportunity to both benefit human health and the wildlife species in question ( Jenkins et al	1
9753	2015 )	1
9754	To minimise transmission of pathogens between wildlife and livestock or humans , it is necessary to understand the species ' ecology and pathogen transmission pathways ( Boadella et al	1
9755	2011 ; Delahay et al	1
9756	2009 )	1
9757	Any investigation of host - pathogen dynamics relies on a sensitive and specific detection assay ( Boadella et al	1

9760	Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures , whose accuracy with more than 5 % information about true pseudoknot - free structures is better than that of @GENE$ , and with about 35 % information about true pseudoknot - free structures compares well with that of @GENE$ V2	1

9766	Redundant items were reduced by " Functional Annotation Clustering " with medium classification stringency	1
9767	The terms with the minimum p - values in every cluster were then selected out and reserved .	1
9768	Similarly , 60 hpi was the optimal time point to analyse the @GENE$ involved in the regulation of apoptosis because @GENE$ accounted for the largest percentage at this time point ( Fig	1
9769	3e ) , and the @GENE$ were the most serious at 60 hpi ( Fig	1
9770	1b )	1
9771	As shown in Fig	1
9772	4b , many proteins related to cell apoptosis were enriched in cluster A , and they were up - regulated during the entire infection period , but most strikingly at 48 and 60 hpi	1
9773	Thus , we concluded that the late stage of @DISEASE$ infection was a better time to investigate the CPV - induced F81 cell apoptosis process	1
9774	As apoptosis may be the main mechanism utilised by viral oncolytic therapy , these ident@GENE$  DEPs may be useful for detailed studies in the future .	1

9810	Both consensus and deep - sequencing data indicate that the haplotype associated with sustained fox - to - fox transmission during the 2009 outbreak occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the @GENE$ of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003 - 2010 were present at the sub - consensus level ( as rare variants in the viral population ) in skunk and fox samples from 1995 ( Figure 5 )	1
9811	Analysis of the Illumina ultra - deep sequencing data supported the hypothesis that variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies than variants that did not	1
9812	In particular , all of the mutations that distinguish the 1995 / 96 haplotype from the 2003 / 10 haplotype were present as rare variants in Fx 31 , the only 2003 sample for which there is deep sequencing @GENE$ data available	1
9813	These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral haplotypes and identify rare haplotypes that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change	1

9824	ORP uses sh@GENE$ ments and longer read lengths to maximize the number of bases i@GENE$ gment , which are sequenced twice	1
9825	The redundant sequencing means reads with base calls that disagree with their overlapping pair are recognized as errors and are discarded to effectively lower the sequencing error rate	1
9826	A position specific base call supported by a read pair can still disagree with the consensus base call leading to detection of rare varia@GENE$  ORPs provide an important benefit over the alternative of adding higher sequencer coverage since the detected mismatches between read pairs give an empirically derived sequencing error rate , which is specific to each sequencer run	1

9886	It was reported that weaning age and pre - weaning health play a key role in the onset of @DISEASE$ [ 30 ]	1
9887	Moreover , the post - weaning period is a critical phase in the pig ' s life when the intestinal immune system is immature , and the sow milk removal , and consequent discontinuation of nutritive intake of the IgA present in this milk ,@GENE$ tributes to increase susceptibility of pigs to @DISEASE$ [ 31 ]	1
9888	Indeed , unlike other food animals , the sow ' s milk is particularly rich in IgA compared to colostrum [ 32 ]	1
9889	St@GENE$ s investigating the profitability of weaning pigs at an early age , before 21 days , have further encouraged moving away from this practice to weaning pigs no earlier than 26 days of age to reduce the occurrence of @DISEASE$ [ 30 , 33 ]	1
9890	In the European Union ( EU ) , many pig producers wean piglets at 21 days of age	1
9891	However welfare legislation encourages weaning no earlier than 28 days of age in the absence of cleaned housing sections to ensure that healthy pigs are transferred into nursery accommodation [ 34 ]	1
9892	Moreover , studies suggest that increasing weaning age reduces stress associated with this period and allows pigs to have a more mature gastrointestinal tract and become increasingly familiar with solid feed during lactation with an improvement in growth performance and in immune response [ 34 , 35 ] .	1
9893	Nurses should be provided with necessary equipment and material resources required to provide care to patients in the @DISEASE$ wards .	1
9894	HotKnots @GENE$ is a heuristic program that given an RNA sequence , first finds about 20 lowest energy stems ( from the set of all stems for the given RNA sequence ) , called @GENE$	1

9898	In our experiments , we choose the structure with the lowest energy value among the 20 output structures as the final structure predicted by @GENE$	1
9899	When reporting prediction accuracy for @GENE$ , we report the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for the average F - measure of the lowest energy structure for all RNA sequences in our data set .	1

9937	Another method to evaluate antioxidant ability is based on the reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + in which the yellow colour of the test solution changes to various shades of green and blue , depending on the reducing power of each sample	1
9938	The presence of reducing agents causes the conversion of @GENE$ to the ferrous form that may be followed at 700 nm due to the formation of Perl ' s Prussian blue Fe 4 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] 3	1
9939	Increasing absorbance at 700 nm indicates an increase in reductive ability [ 44 ]	1

9942	[ 82 ] and Psammogeton canescens [ 49 ]	1
9943	In this case , the antioxidant activity measured by the β - carotene bleaching and DPPH tests showed weak activity	1
9944	The authors attributed such activity to the low concentration of phenolic compounds present in the essential oils , nevertheless the reducing power of the same samples is similar to that of the reference ascorbic acid , mainly at higher concentrations [ 49 ] .	1

9990	Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection , the presence of @DISEASE$ within CNS - draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low level@GENE$ mRNA encoding@GENE$ tein in control DTR − mice ( Figure 2D )	1

9995	Several large epidemics of severe forms of @DISEASE$ in young children are associated with @DISEASE$ that may occasionally cause permanent @DISEASE$ or death [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ]	1
9996	In our study , we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice from being infected ( Fig	1
9997	4 ) ; viral load from different tissues ( CNS and muscle ) of N3 - treated hSCARB2 - transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non - treated groups ( Fig	1
9998	5 - 6 )	1
9999	These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection	1
10000	Indeed , several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71 - induced immunopathogenesis [ 19 , 32 ]	1

10006	Beside EV71 , @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ is primarily attributed to @DISEASE$ , and immune infiltration and reclamation [ 34 , 35 ]	1
10007	Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of @DISEASE$ [ 36 ] .	1

10028	In order to test whether @GENE$ or @GENE$ of HEV inhibit cellular @GENE$ activity , a @GENE$ with @GENE$ , which contains @GENE$ , cloned upstream of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; [ 10 ] was used	1
10029	This vector was inducible by @GENE$ activating agents like TPA or IL - 1β	1
10030	Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the @GENE$ along with either @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
10031	Assay of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) activity using these cell extracts revealed that @GENE$ protein inhibited the NF - κB @GENE$ activity ( Figure 1A )	1
10032	However , no inhibition was observed by @GENE$ expression ( Figure 1A )	1
10033	In order to investigate whether @GENE$ mediated inhibition of @GENE$ activity was an artifact of the experimental system , cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( TPA ) , a known inducer of @GENE$ activity [ 11 ] , or transfected with an expression construct of @GENE$ , which is the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ that acts as a constitutively active inducer of @GENE$ activity [ 12 ]	1
10034	TPA treatment increased @GENE$ activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in @GENE$ activity ( Figure 1A )	1
10035	Similarly , co - expression of @GENE$ in IKKβ transfected cells resulted in downregulation of @GENE$ activity in comparison to cells transfected with only @GENE$ ( Figure 1B )	1
10036	These results clearly suggest that HEV @GENE$ inhibits @GENE$ activity .	1
10037	In the present study , we identified a @GENE$ in the @GENE$ by stimulating T cells from MVA - MERS - N vaccinated BALB / c mice with a 2 - D matrix pool of overlapping peptides	1
10038	These mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the @GENE$ as an important vaccine antigen for induction of @GENE$ [ 23 , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] 54 ]	1
10039	Moreover , BALB / c mice transduced with the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive @DISEASE$ , which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS - CoV - specific immunization using the MERS - CoV S pro@GENE$  43 , 44 ]	1
10040	Here , we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an MVA - delivered @GENE$ on of cellular immune responses in mice	1
10041	In general , the N protein is a w@GENE$ ved internal protein@GENE$ ructural component incorporating the viral RNA within@GENE$  nucleocaps@GENE$ ious studies , the SARS - CoV N pro@GENE$ ed as candidate antigen for vaccine development [ 56 ] , and an experimental DNA vaccine efficiently induced SARS - CoV N - specific cellular immunity [ 57 , 58 ]	1
10042	In line with this data , recent studies in @DISEASE$ patients demonstrated that both antibody and T cell responses are associated with recovery from @DISEASE$ [ 59 ] .	1
10043	Current @DISEASE$ guidelines , recommend a trial with inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) in these children , based on the established pathophysiology of @DISEASE$ and the proven efficacy in @DISEASE$ in adults [ 2 , 6 , 7 ] .	1
10044	This study was approved by two institutional review boards ( KSA Ministry of Health and Western IRB )	1
10045	Banked serum samples were collected using convenience sampling in July 2012 from 300 animal - exposed and 50 non - matched human controls residing in Jazan region , KSA , as part of a study investigating human @DISEASE$ exposure	1
10046	The crosssectional , convenience sample of human sera was chosen for its self - reported exposure to domestic animals , such as camels , as studies have documented increasing evidence that camels are a reservoir for MERS - CoV 5 , 6 and human @DISEASE$ were later reported in the area .	1
10047	On the other hand , in the last several years , studies have reported the isolation of colistin - resistant E	1
10048	coli from pigs [ 13 , 14 ] , the proportion reaching 35 % in some countries [ 15 ]	1
10049	Until recently , resistance to colistin had only been associated with non - transferable genome mediated mutation	1
10050	However , in 2015 , a @GENE$ , @GENE$ , encoding a @GENE$ conferring resistance to colistin was identified in certain @GENE$ , such as E	1
10051	coli and Salmonella , isolated from various origins including farm animals , raw meat and humans , in several countries [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]	1
10052	The discovery of a mechanism for horizontal transfer of colistin resistance , and hence the potential for interspecies transfers , gave rise to a strong reaction in the scientific community regarding the potential reduction of colistin effectiveness in human medicine [ 19 ]	1
10053	Food producing animals , and in particular pigs , have been singled out as the most potential reservoirs for spread and amplification of colistin resistance [ 19 ]	1
10054	Thus , scientists and regulatory agencies such as the European Medicine Agency ( EMA ) have recommended reducing the use of colistin in animal production and to restrict its use to the treatment of sick animals as a last resort option [ 20 ]	1
10055	In addition , several studies have reported coexistence of the @GENE$ with genes encoding the production of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]	1
10056	This constitutes an additional degree of concern about the risk of spread of resistance against antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine	1
10057	Furthermore , a high prevalence of ESBL - positive E	1
10058	coli isolated from @DISEASE$ piglets has been reported [ 24 ]	1
10059	Taken together , these findings underline the need to better understand @DISEASE$ risk factors and to find alternatives to antimicrobials and particularly to colistin in pigs for the control of @DISEASE$ in order to manage antimicrobial resistance and maintain at the same time livestock productivity	1
10060	Hence , the aim of the present review was to provide an overview of risk factors of @DISEASE$ as well as an update of information on the extent of colistin use in @DISEASE$ control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes	1
10061	In addition , alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed	1
10062	Finally , a practical approach is proposed for the control of the PWD in its various phases .	1
10063	In this article we consider time series methods for the modeling and detection of respiratory - related outbreak signatures based on chest radiograph ordering patterns from a number of pediatric emergency departments ( EDs ) located in the Midwestern region of the United States .	1
10064	In vitro propagation is an important tool for rapid multiplication of medicinal plants [ 17 , 18 ] as well as for the production of secondary metabolites	1
10065	Tissue culture will ensure that the sources of the medicinal plants will not be exhausted or overexploited for their secondary metabolites	1
10066	This is because the number of wild plants will not be effected due to overharvesting of the respective plants	1
10067	Moreover the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques	1
10068	Previously , Yew et al	1
10069	[ 18 ] have reported the effect of different cytokinins on in vitro shoot length and multiplication of H	1
10070	littoralis	1
10071	By adjusting phytohormones concentrations in the medium , differences in amount , rate , and growth patterns of explants were observed [ 19 , 20 ] .	1

10078	These findings demonstrate some of the reasons for reduced inflammation in bats during @DISEASE$	1
10079	Mechanisms to modulate inflammation may have evolved to mitigate the detrimental effects of flight	1
10080	Excessive exposure to cytosolic@GENE$ lls during flight might have posed a strong natural selection pressure to reduce the activation of bat DNA s@GENE$ 	1

10084	The study was approved by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of the Hospital for @DISEASE$ and the University of Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee ( OXTREC 012 - 06 ) .	1
10085	In the 2001 @DISEASE$ outbreak , early dissemination of the disease , prior to the first detected case , was mainly a result of long - distance movement of livestock between farms and through markets [ 10 ]	1
10086	In other countries where @DISEASE$ is endemic , livestock movements are believed to play a significant role in disease persistence [ 11 ]	1
10087	Movements of live animals are also thought to cause significant transmission of diseases such as @DISEASE$ ( bTB ) in the UK [ 12 , 13 ] , as well as @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ in southeast Asia , Australasia and Africa [ 14 , 15 ] , and @DISEASE$ in Africa [ 16 ]	1
10088	In cases such as these , infected livestock may be moved prior to showing symptoms , and therefore there is a risk of long - distance spread occurring	1
10089	It is therefore crucial to understand the risk of infection spread associated with livestock movements .	1
10090	On days 10 and 18 pi , 2 / 7 and 3 / 7 of the birds respectively had yolk material and fibrin clots on the serosal surface of the organs in the abdomen , in association with a @DISEASE$ at the level of the cecal tonsils .	1
10091	In order to investigate of whether DUB activities play any role in late steps of HIV - 1 replication , we analyzed @GENE$ release and @GENE$ processing after DI treatment	1
10092	For this purpose HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the HIV - 1 expression plasmid @GENE$ [ 43 ] which directs efficient expression of all @GENE$ except the @GENE$	1
10093	Cells were treated with the following DIs : P22077 , which specifically inhibits the DUBs @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 59 ] , the DI P5091 , which only inhibits @GENE$ [ 60 ] , and the DI PR - 619 , that , in addition to @GENE$ and @GENE$ , inhibits the DUBs @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ [ 59 ]	1
10094	Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions , using @GENE$ , revealed that treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 led to an overall defect in @GENE$ processing with prominent accumulation of the @GENE$ as well as the processing intermediates @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in the VLP fractions ( Figure 1A )	1
10095	In contrast , addition of the DI P5091 , which is selective for @GENE$ , had no influence on @GENE$ processing ( Figure 1B )	1
10096	Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of @GENE$ processing was reduced by about 2 - fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR - 619 , whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication	1
10097	Although the DI P22077 and PR - 619 clearly reduced @GENE$ processing , none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ) .	1
10098	We evaluated the viral colonization of organs carrying out three complementary assays , namely the detection of the virus M gene by qRRT - PCR , isolation and titration of the virus in MDCK cells by TCID 50 and the detection of the @GENE$ by IHC .	1
10099	To evaluate whether @GENE$ injection caused @DISEASE$ in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice , we examined serum ALT levels and liver histology following poly ( I : C ) injection	1
10100	We found that , following poly ( I : C ) injection , serum ALT levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice increased , reached a peak one day after injection , declined from day 1 to day 6 , and were not elevated thereafter ; this time - course indicated that poly ( I : C ) injection alone did not induced continuous @DISEASE$ ( figure S6 )	1
10101	Based on these findings , we believe that the effects of pol@GENE$ ection in these mice did not confound our analysis of @DISEASE$ .	1
10102	In conclusion , our findings demonstrated that rVV - N25 is a promising candidate for an @DISEASE$ vaccine therapy	1
10103	Additionally , the findings of this study indicate that rVV - N25 immunization can be used for prevention of @DISEASE$ and as an antiviral therapy against ongoing @DISEASE$ .	1
10104	@DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ can be included in the list of possible causes of the feline @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
10105	This painful and common @DISEASE$ is considered multifactorial in cats and treated by full mouth teeth extraction for eliminating oral plaque antigenic stimulation	1
10106	Corticosteroids are frequently used to improve the clinical signs ; however , when this was tried in some cats with oral disease associated with @DISEASE$ it induced worsening of @DISEASE$ [ 11 , 66 ] .	1
10107	Relative lymphocytosis and an increase in serum @GENE$ activity were significantly associated with seroreactivity to L	1
10108	infantum [ 78 ] .	1
10109	To assess the possibility that the cell cycle status affects EV - D68 viral replication , we first synchronized cells in G0 / G1	1
10110	Our results demonstrate that G0 / G1 arrest promotes EV - D68 replication and increases viral virulence without affecting virus entry	1
10111	We also assessed the effects of S phase and G2 / M phase synchronization on viral production	1
10112	Our results suggest that S phase synchronization does not affect viral entry , replication or production compared to the control treatment , while G2 / M synchronization inhibits viral replication and decreases viral virulence , but does not affect virus entry	1
10113	These results indicate that G0 / G1 phase is most favorable for EV - D68 replication , that S phase can support some viral production , and that G2 / M phase is inhibitory for host viral production .	1

10137	These results suggest that the @GENE$ may contribute to the enhanced cell cycle exit from G2 / M phase after EV - D68 infection .	1
10138	Recently , interest has been generated in the development of peptide therapeutics as potential drug targets for different pathogens	1
10139	Currently , more than 140 peptide therapeutics are lined up for clinical evaluation presenting peptide research as a component of pharmaceutical research [ 80 ]	1
10140	As compared with chemical drugs , peptide drugs show high specificity toward the target as well as little side effect and drug tolerance [ 19 ]	1
10141	Many peptide therapeutics have shown positive results against @DISEASE$ , for instance RVFV - 6 peptide against @DISEASE$ virus and Kn2 - 7 peptide derived from scorpion venom against HIV - 1 [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]	1
10142	Antimicrobial peptides are cited as potential novel antiviral therapeutics against @DISEASE$ [ 84 ]	1
10143	Antimicrobial peptides are produced by host immune system upon initial exposure to pathogens	1
10144	These are gene encoded and positively charged peptides that are selectively toxic against their targets [ 85 , 86 ]	1
10145	This selectivity is due to their positive charge which attacks the negatively charged membrane bilayer of microbes [ 87 ]	1
10146	The antimicrobial peptides block the receptors present o@GENE$  cell ' s surface , which in turn inhibit different steps of viral fusion and replication causing virolysis and activation of host ' s adaptive immune response [ 88 ] .	1
10147	Data was collected through in - depth individual interviews	1

10151	The interview dates and times were arranged with participants prior to data collection date	1
10152	Data collection took place between April - July 2015	1
10153	The interviews were conducted early in the morning as suggested by participants before they could start with their duties to avoid distracting them from their normal ward routine work	1
10154	Separate interviews with six participants took place in a private office within @DISEASE$ wards at the regional hospital , and each lasted approximately 30 min	1
10155	All interviews were conducted by the researcher	1
10156	All interviews started with an opening question : " What is your experience when nursing patients who suffer from @DISEASE$ ? "	1

10163	This study was carried out in strict accordance with regulations of the Swiss law for animal protection ( SR 445	1
10164	1 )	1
10165	The Veterinary Office of the Swiss Canton of Zurich officially revised the protocol and approved the study ( Permit no	1
10166	TVB 99 / 2007 and TVB 100 / 2007 )	1
10167	The animals were housed in groups in an animalfriendly barrier facility under optimal ethological conditions [ 55 ]	1
10168	For blood collections and injections , the cats were sedated with a combination of ketamin and midazolam , and all possible efforts were made to minimize stress and suffering .	1
10169	To further confirm that nascent HIV - 1 viral particles could recruit @GENE$ , cryo - EM was performed on cells co - expressing HIV - 1 and @GENE$ using @GENE$ and @GENE$ conjugated to gold beads of different sizes ( Figure 3D )	1
10170	The results obtained with this analysis indicated that @GENE$ are indeed present at sites of @GENE$ budding , further supporting the notion that @GENE$ are truly incorporated into HIV - 1 virion particles .	1
10171	The inhibitory effects of Abies koreana Horstmann ' s Silberlocke essential oil , mainly constituted by bornyl acetate , limonene and α - pinene , on @GENE$ ( NO and @GENE$ ) were related to the modulation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ expression , since the expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ and @GENE$ was reduced [ 143 ] .	1
10172	The fruit essential oils of Cinnamomum insularimontanum Hayata and citral were revealed to possess significant inhibitory effects on NO production in LPS - stimulated RAW 264	1
10173	7 cells	1
10174	Citral exhibited an inhibitory activity in LPS - induced @GENE$ protein expression , not found for @GENE$	1
10175	The authors studied the effect of citral on @GENE$ pathway for enlightening the mechanism of the citralmediated inhibition of @GENE$ transcription	1
10176	The authors concluded that citral could prevent the degradation of @GENE$ in LPS - induced inflammation and reduce the p50 @GENE$ levels in nuclear fractions [ 121 ]	1
10177	In another study , it was reported that in human macrophage - like U937 cells , citral suppressed both @GENE$ - induced COX - 2 mRNA and protein expression , dose - dependently	1
10178	Moreover , citral induced the mRNA expression of the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ , suggesting that citral activates @GENE$ , and regulates @GENE$ expression [ 147 ]	1
10179	A same behaviour was observed for carvacrol .	1
10180	is needed to reveal more information about codon usage bias variation within poliovirus and other responsible factors .	1
10181	In contrast to @DISEASE$ , which are known to be associated with @DISEASE$ in young children , @DISEASE$ have long been considered of no importance in @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and antibiotic therapy is not recommended in current @DISEASE$ treatment guidelines [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
10182	However , several studies suggest that bacteria might play a role in @DISEASE$ in young children [ 9 , 10 , 17 , 19 , 20 ]	1
10183	Moreover , it is increasingly appreciated that the human body is home to an extended microbiome , with @DISEASE$ children harbouring different bacteria and a less diverse mix compared to healthy children [ 21 ]	1
10184	Characterisation of the predominant bacteria in @DISEASE$ children is essential to understand the pathophysiology of persistent wheezing .	1
10185	where m and n represent the number of subclasses in the exposed and infectious categories , respectively	1
10186	The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1 / r and 1 / c , respectively , and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data	1
10187	This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [ 36 ] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [ 33 ]	1
10188	The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A	1
10189	It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0	1
10190	In general , as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed ( increasing n ) , lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k	1
10191	On the other hand , as the variance in the latent period is reduced ( increasing m ) , higher values of R 0 are estimated	1
10192	Indeed , we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle : if we ignore the latent period , then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection ' s basic reproductive ratio	1
10193	When the latent period is included , however , this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B )	1
10194	In closely examining equation 4 , we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class ( 1 / r ¼ 0 ) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included ( 1 / r	1
10195	0 ) ( see equation S1 in Protocol S1 )	1
10196	Therefore , when faced with a rapidly spreading infection , either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures ( such as mass vaccination ) that will be needed to control the epidemic	1
10197	The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk	1
10198	The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed ( lower surface ) or fixed ( higher surface )	1
10199	We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k	1
10200	( B ) At higher values of k , R 0 may be substantially over - or underestimated using the classical exponent distributed model ( n ¼ m ¼ 1 ) compared to periods of fixed lengths ( n ¼ m ! ' ) , depending on whether an exposed class is included ( solid lines ) or not ( dashed lines )	1

10207	Full parental consent was obtained orally after explanation of the procedure , its benefits and its risks .	1
10208	One of the possible mechanisms of the antioxidative action is the chelation of transition metals	1
10209	Transition metal ions can stimulate lipid peroxidation by participating in the generation of initiating species and by accelerating peroxidation , decomposing lipid hydroperoxides into other components which are able to abstract hydrogen , perpetuating the chain of reaction of lipid peroxidation [ 52 ] .	1
10210	We compare the average accuracy of @GENE$ , @GENE$ - PKonly and Iterative @GENE$ with different input structures .	1
10211	Based on the above findings , the following recommendations were made :	1
10212	Managers must ensure that they provide their staff with regular in - service training and workshops to equip them with up - to - date information on @DISEASE$ care and infection control practices .	1
10213	In this section we explain details of our computational experiments .	1
10214	HeLa cells were transiently transfected with @GENE$ wt	1
10215	After overnight cultivation at 37 • C the cell culture supernatant was harvested and @GENE$ released into the supernatant were pelleted through 20 % ( w / v ) sucrose by centrifugation ( 20 , 000 × g , 4 • C , 90 min ) , washed with ice cold PBS , centrifuged ( 20 , 000 × g , 4 • C , 90 min ) , lysed in SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) sample buffer containing 2 % SDS , and boiled for 5 min	1
10216	The cells were detached and washed twice in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer , supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 5 mM NEM , and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete ( Roche )	1
10217	The samples were analyzed by western blotting	1
10218	Protein bands were quantified using AIDA [ 54 ] .	1

10223	Principal components factor analysis of the survey data yielded an underlying factor structure of four independent factors	1
10224	Based on a subjective analysis of the content of items loading on each individual factor , the four factors were labelled as follows : ' Justification , ' ' Sanctions , ' ' Burdens , ' and ' Safeguards ' ( as shown in Table 2 ) .	1
10225	A 21 base - long ribo - oligonucleotide ( 500 nM ) labeled with 6 - carboxyfluorescein ( @GENE$ ) at the @GENE$ and a black hole quencher ( BHQ ) at the @GENE$ were synthesized ( @GENE$ - CGATGAGTGCCATGGATATAC - BHQ 39 ) , annealed to the @GENE$ , and then delivered into cells in 96 - black - well plates using Lipofectamine transfection reagent ( Invitrogen )	1
10226	Immediately after changing the medium , the real - time fluorescence intensity of the cells was read for 2 hr in real time using a fluorescence analyzer at 5 min intervals ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) .	1
10227	@GENE$ and @GENE$ , which have @GENE$ activity , have been used as @GENE$ against potato spindle tuber viroid and @DISEASE$ , respectively [ 21 , 22 ]	1
10228	Our observations and those of others on the effects of exogenous expressi@GENE$ RN@GENE$  Pac@GENE$ ISG20 ) and@GENE$ le@GENE$  scFv ) indicate that it is possible to develop transgenic plants and animal cells and even entire organisms that are virus - resistant	1
10229	However , host RNA could be degraded nonselectively by 3D8@GENE$ RNase activity in 3D8 scFv - expressing cells	1
10230	During the transformation process , antiviral transgenic cell lines or organisms can be developed if ( 1 ) the amou@GENE$ otein expressed does not inhibit the physiological and developmental processes of cells or organisms , and ( 2 ) the amou@GENE$ otein produced is sufficient to protect against virus infection .	1
10231	Children with physician diagnosed , persistent @DISEASE$ unresponsive to ICS therapy , who underwent FOB + BAL between January 2005 and December 2007 were included	1
10232	As a tertiary referral centre , we are referred children for further evaluation and treatment of persistent @DISEASE$ despite ICS treatment and anti - reflux therapy in those with demonstrated @DISEASE$	1
10233	Our initial assessment includes a detailed history of disease , symptoms , signs and treatment adherence , a check for the appropriateness of treatment administration and dosage , and a thorough physical examination	1
10234	In children without any apparent explanation for persistent @DISEASE$ , a work - up , including FOB + BAL is conducted	1
10235	In these cases , FOB + BAL is always performed under stable condition , outside episodes of acute infection or exacerbation of @DISEASE$ .	1
10236	In the present study , 16 unique proteins were identified in patients with @DISEASE$ and those with HBV - induced @DISEASE$ that had ≥ 1	1
10237	5 - fold differences in expression compared with those in the healthy controls	1
10238	Those proteins belonged to six different categories based on protein function , while two out of the five proteins that were analyzed using western blotting were not classified according to biological p@GENE$  pre@GENE$  precursor )	1
10239	The biological functions of the remaining proteins in @DISEASE$ and progression that were analyzed have not yet been elucidated ; however , a number of theories are discussed in the following section .	1
10240	Residual diagnostic faecal samples or tissue ( intestine or mesenteric lymph node ) obtained post - mortem were collected prospectively in Australia from 7 April 2015 until 30 August 2018 and from the UAE and New Zealand during suspected outbreaks of @DISEASE$ in 2017	1
10241	In addition , a stored faecal sample from a cat diagnosed with @DISEASE$ in the first outbreak in Australia in 2014 was obtained for study .	1
10242	For in vivo virus replication experiments , mice were infected with @DISEASE$ and euthanized at specific days post - infection , as indicated	1
10243	For tissue collection , mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine / acepromazine , blood collected in serum separator tubes , then transcardially perfused with sterile Dulbecco ' s phosphate - buffered saline ( dPBS ; Gibco )	1
10244	The spleen and kidneys were collected , then the brain and spinal cord removed and microdissected	1
10245	All organs were snap frozen , weighed , and then homogenized in dPBS	1
10246	Virus was titered by standard plaque assay with BHK21 cells , as described previously [ 46 ]	1
10247	Serum viremia was measured using TaqMan quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) primers and probe listed in Table 1 , as described previously [ 47 ] .	1
10248	Recent data from our laboratory further supports an @DISEASE$ etiology playing a role in @DISEASE$	1
10249	Numerous studies show that after an antigenic challenge , vaccination and natural infections , B cells transitioning to plasma cells , termed plasmablasts ( PBs ) , can be seen in the peripheral blood [ 130 , 131 ]	1
10250	These can be recognized by su@GENE$  CD@GENE$ downregulation of CD@GENE$ and high levels of CD@GENE$ d CD@GENE$ 3 , 132 ]	1
10251	In comparison to the general circulating B cell population , PBs are enriched for B cells that contain in@GENE$ 133 , 134 ]	1
10252	This is variable as some studies show massive and high enrichment of PBs targeting the antigen of interest [ 135 , 136 ] , while other studies show polyspecificity of the PB population and limited enrichment [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ]	1
10253	Immunization studies in adults ( @DISEASE$ [ 141 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 132 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 142 ] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment f@GENE$ es , temporally peak 5 - 10 days after immunization , and are predictive of later sero - immunity [ 143 ]	1
10254	Elevated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections , as they are elevated in a number of @DISEASE$ and their levels correlate to disease flares [ 144 ]	1
10255	Although certain infections , such as @DISEASE$ , may set off exceedingly high PB levels [ 145 ] , PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in @DISEASE$ than levels achieved during vaccination or post - infection	1
10256	This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying @DISEASE$ , and specifically correlates with c - reactive protein ( CRP ) leve@GENE$ AS@GENE$  145 , 146 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 147 , 148 ] .	1
10257	@GENE$ expressed in @GENE$ or @GENE$ were purified from Escherichia coli TG1 or BL21 / DE3 / pLysS cells	1
10258	Single colonies were picked into Luria - Bertani broth and grown at 37 • C to an OD 600 of 0	1

10267	Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated to complete lysis	1
10268	Protein purification was performed using Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ; Qiagen ) according to standard procedures ( 29 )	1
10269	@GENE$ was expressed in BL21 / DE3 / pLysS cells as above and purified using glutathione agarose resin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) according to standard procedures ( 30 )	1

10273	Collectively , our results show that previously generated @GENE$ , which targeted VP1 linear epitope @GENE$ and neutralized subgenogroups B4 and B5 strains of EV71 in vitro [ 17 ] , was also able to cross - protect @DISEASE$ in vitro ( Fig	1
10274	1 ) and in hSCARB2 - transgenic mouse model	1
10275	N3 conferred protection through the reduction of viral load and the secretion of proinflammatory c@GENE$ to @DISEASE$ and immunopathogenesis .	1
10276	In the present study , we report the ability of the @GENE$ to inhibit the cellular @GENE$ activity	1
10277	In human @DISEASE$ cells ,@GENE$  protein could directly associate with the F - box protein@GENE$  and heterologous expression of the@GENE$  protein led to reduced recruitment of@GENE$  and@GENE$  subunits to the@GENE$  , resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the@GENE$ 	1
10278	This , in turn , led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the@GENE$  , which is the major subunit of the@GENE$ 	1
10279	Analysis of two@GENE$  further confirmed the above observation	1
10280	The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed .	1
10281	In conclusion , the public health providers in our study did not have evidence of @DISEASE$ transmission after direct contact with confirmed patients when PPE was used properly .	1
10282	Finally , the MVA - MERS - N vector virus generated for this study proved to be a stable recombinant virus that can be readily amplified to obtain vaccine preparations technically fulfilling all requirements for further preclinical or even clinical development	1
10283	Future work with MVA - MERS - N candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of N - specific immune responses in @DISEASE$ models and contribute to our better understanding of MERS vaccine - induced protection .	1

10288	It is estimated that approximately 180 million people have been infected with the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and approximately 130 million people are chronic @DISEASE$ carriers ( 1 ) .	1
10289	The relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) values , effective number of codon ( ENC ) values , nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) among 48 @DISEASE$ isolates including 31 of genotype 1 , 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3 .	1
10290	To investigate the effects of @GENE$ on the CSFV replication , stable PK - 15 cell line overexpressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was generated and infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0	1
10291	1	1
10292	The @GENE$ expression in the CSFV - infected PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells was decreased at 48 and 72 h post - infection ( hpi ) , compared with that in the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3A , B )	1
10293	Real - time RT - PCR analysis revealed that the @GENE$ copies in the PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi , compared with the PK - EGFP cells ( Figure 3C )	1
10294	Additionally , yields of infectious virus in culture supernatant of PK - EGFP - eEF1A cells were decreased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 3D )	1
10295	The results indicated the @GENE$ negatively modulates the CSFV replication .	1
10296	Despite many publications on the pharmacological effects of its chemical constituents , there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis of H	1
10297	littoralis wild plants or callus culture	1
10298	Likewise , there is no report on the capability of callus culture of H	1
10299	littoralis to produce secondary metabolites such as lycorine which has important pharmacological effects	1
10300	The establishment and quantification of lycorine via in vitro propagation technique could be a first step in mass production of any desired secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical industries	1
10301	Thus , in the present study , a simple HPLC with UV detection method was developed for phytochemical analysis of different parts of H	1
10302	littoralis wild plants	1
10303	The method was further extended for the quantification of lycorine in callus culture obtained from various combinations of 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ) and 6 - benzylaminopurine concentrations .	1
10304	The type of inflammatory infiltrate found in tissue cytology ( aspirates , impression smears ) or histopathology in organs such as skin , eye , oral mucosa , liver , spleen and kidney is commonly @DISEASE$ [ 66 , 68 , 72 ]	1
10305	There was also @DISEASE$ in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes [ 79 ] and spleen [ 57 ] , with variable numbers of @DISEASE$ amastigotes observed ( Fig	1
10306	7 ) .	1
10307	G2 / M synchronization with nocodazole has been shown to inhibit both the EV - D68 Fermon strain in this study ( Figures 1I - L ) and EV - A71 in our previous study ( Yu et al	1
10308	, 2015 )	1
10309	To determine whether similar effects of G2 / M - phase synchronization are observed for the currently circulating strains of EV - D68 , cells were treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h , and were then infected at 0	1
10310	8 MOI for 2 h and treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole or fresh medium for another 24 h	1
10311	Our results demonstrate that nocodazole treatment decreased the @GENE$ levels ( Figure 6A ) and the TCID50 / ml value ( Figure 6B ) of Fermon , US / KY / 14 - 18953 and US / MO / 14 - 18947 , which suggests that the virus inhibition upon G2 / M synchronization may be similar for all @DISEASE$ .	1
10312	Approximately twice as high benefits are achievable by filtration of outdoor air in However , largest health benefits can be achieved by the source control approach ( scenario 3	1
10313	0 ) , which significantly reduces the need to control exposures by dilution .	1
10314	@GENE$ and @GENE$ the spleen	1
10315	Notably , even with rVV - N25 immunization , the frequency of activated CD8 T cells was very low , and a minimum of 2 - weeks incubation was required to distinguish the difference between rVV treatments	1
10316	Even if a small population of specific CD8 + T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of @GENE$ , it is difficult to assert that the only NS2specific CD8 + T cells were important to this reduction	1
10317	However , based on the results presented in Figure 4B , we are able to conclude that at least CD8 + and / or CD4 + T cells were important to the reduction in @GENE$ otein	1
10318	Therefore , to elucidate the mechanism of HCV protein clearance , further investigation of not only the @GENE$ topes but also other immunocompetent cells is required .	1
10319	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
10320	This study was designed as a case - control study , including patients with @DISEASE$ , an unmatched hospital control group and a community control group matched by residency and age , at a ratio of 1 : 3	1
10321	The study was conducted at the Hospital for @DISEASE$ ( HTD ) , a tertiary referral hospital of @DISEASE$ in the south of Viet Nam , between May 2006 and June 2009	1
10322	The recruitment of cases and hospital control groups took place at the dedicated Central Nervous System ( CNS ) @DISEASE$ ward at HTD	1
10323	Community controls were recruited according to the residency of the cases in the south of Viet Nam , mainly in Ho Chi Minh City and the provinces of the Mekong River Delta .	1
10324	In order to check whether the phosphorylation of @GENE$ was altered in ORF2 expressing cells , the level of phosphorylated @GENE$ ( ser32 ) was measured in ORF2 expressing cells	1
10325	@GENE$ expression marginally increased the levels of phospho @GENE$ ( Figure 2C , upper panel , lane 1 and 2 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below ) as well as the level of total @GENE$ ( middle panel , lane 1 and 2 )	1
10326	In IKKβ and ORF2 co - expressing cells , the level of total as well as phosphorylated @GENE$ was significantly higher as compared to only IKKβ expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4 )	1
10327	In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKKβ expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of @GENE$ , one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG - 132 for 2 hours , resulting in equal @GENE$ protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6 )	1
10328	Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with @GENE$ to check equal loading	1
10329	Thus , it appears that @GENE$ expression prevents the degradation of @GENE$	1
10330	The fact that @GENE$ did not interfere with phosphorylation of @GENE$ by the @GENE$ was further confirmed by checking the activity of the @GENE$	1
10331	ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) levels	1
10332	As expected , @GENE$ expression ( 2 or 4 μg plasmid DNA transfection ) did not modulate the levels of @GENE$ ( Figure 2D ) .	1

10335	The DUB - Inhibitors @GENE$ and @GENE$ Impair Gag Processing without Affecting @GENE$ Activity	1
10336	To determine how @GENE$ could be embarked into HIV - 1 viral particles , we analyzed the degree of intracellular co - localization existing between @GENE$ and @GENE$ , the main structural element of retroviral particles	1
10337	To this end , cells were transfected as above in the presence of a small amount of @GENE$ , prior to confocal microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A and B )	1
10338	As previously reported , all @GENE$ were found at the plasma membrane , although more specific patterns could be observed for individual @GENE$ ( more prominent intracellular localization of @GENE$ and higher cell membrane distribution of @GENE$ )	1
10339	@GENE$ displayed an heterogeneous and mostly punctuate intracellular localization pattern , as extensively reported by others [ 32 ] and not surprisingly the two signals overlapped at least partially ( Figure 3B , depicts a two - dimensional graph presenting pixel intensities for the cells presented above )	1
10340	The degree of reciprocal colocalization between @GENE$ and @GENE$ was more carefully quantified by measuring the Manders overlap coefficient ( Figure 3C )	1
10341	From 50 to 65 % of @GENE$ was found to co - localize with @GENE$ and about 70 % of @GENE$ co - localized with @GENE$ , which is overall not surprising in light of the natural intracellular distribution of these proteins	1
10342	No major relocalization of either @GENE$ or @GENE$ was noted upon co - expression , indicating that these proteins are unlikely to influence the trafficking of each other	1
10343	So , overall this analysis indicates that in light of their natural membrane distribution , @GENE$ can find themselves at sites in which HIV - 1 virion particles assembly takes place , providing a reason for their incorporation in HIV - 1 virions .	1
10344	To determine whether our protease - mutant viruses differed significantly from our wildtype virus , we characterized fitness and replication characteristics	1
10345	As shown in Figure 2A , the wildtype and mutant viruses replicate with similar kinetics	1
10346	To ascertain whether these viruses produced similar levels of infectious particles , we measured the ratio of @GENE$ to infectious virus	1
10347	Vero cells were infected with the wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h , and subsequently , viral titers ( Figure 3A ) were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant	1
10348	The number of @GENE$ was quantified by qRT - PCR ( Figure 3B ) , and the ratio of genomes to infectious virus ( pfu ) calculated ( Figure 3C )	1
10349	We observed no changes in viral titers in polyamine - sufficient conditions , and @GENE$ were slightly elevated , though not statistically significant , in 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutant viruses ( Figure 3B )	1
10350	Overall , the genome - to - pfu ratio was not statistically significantly different among our protease mutant viruses .	1
10351	The reduction in @GENE$ cleavage by @GENE$ in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral @GENE$ activity , or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication , @GENE$ translation , and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity	1
10352	To directly measure viral @GENE$ activity in cells , we generated a @GENE$ - sensitive @GENE$ system	1
10353	In this split @GENE$ system , cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly @GENE$ activity , which can be normalized to a @GENE$ control	1
10354	This system has previously been used to explore the activity of @GENE$ [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion	1
10355	To generate this system , we cloned a @GENE$ - @GENE$ - and a @GENE$ - @GENE$ - into the @GENE$ [ 37 ]	1
10356	We also cloned @GENE$ into the @GENE$ to drive robust @GENE$ expression	1
10357	These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO	1
10358	Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity	1
10359	We observed that for both @GENE$ ( Figure 4C ) and @GENE$ ( Figure 4D ) , @GENE$ activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 µM	1
10360	These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral @GENE$ activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral @GENE$ activity .	1

10363	7 cells were found by Kim et al	1
10364	( 2008 ) [ 144 ] , with a concomitant inhibition of iNOS and COX - 2 mRNA expression , might explain the anti - inflammatory activity of this oil	1
10365	The same authors in another work , and using the essential oil of Illicium anisatum L	1

10367	7 cells , along with the decrease of @GENE$ and @GENE$ proteins and iNOS and @GENE$ mRNA expression [ 145 ] .	1
10368	We carried out a series of experiments with the objective to characterize both the immunomodulatory and antiviral properties of @GENE$ in the domestic cat	1
10369	In vitro , the prototype of CpG - A , ODN 2216 [ 12 ] , strengthened the antiviral qualities of feline immune cells and stimulated their production of soluble molecules that inhibited the replication of five different families of viruses : Coronaviridae , Herpesviridae , Caliciviridae , Parvoviridae , and Retroviridae	1
10370	In vivo , ODN 2216 induced a systemic antiviral state .	1
10371	The stock solution of lycorine was prepared by dissolving accurately weighed standard in methanol to give the concentration of 100 g / mL .	1
10372	The @GENE$ of @GENE$ is expansive with openings on three sides allowing for the accommodation of large peptide substrates	1
10373	Its exclusive @GENE$ activity is the direct result of hydrogen bonds formed between @GENE$ residues Gln208 , Glu350 and Glu406 with the N - terminal amine group of the peptide substrate	1
10374	Di - @GENE$ activity is not observed because favorable hydrogen bonds cannot be made to anchor the peptide in the proper orientation for bond hydrolysis	1
10375	The importance of these hydrogen bonds in peptide binding was also evident in our inhibitor study in which the @GENE$ of HSPW peptides were capped with different groups	1
10376	By removing one or more potential hydrogen bonds from the @GENE$ , the capped peptides were unable to bind , resulting in poor inhibition	1
10377	In addition to these @GENE$ residues , our global analysis revealed previously uncharacterized prime - side specificity features that were dictated by hydrophobic interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding with main chain groups	1
10378	These important interactions were evident when the @GENE$ of our lead inhibitor was truncated	1
10379	The removal of @GENE$ or both Pro4 and @GENE$ abrogated the ability of the peptide to inhibit @GENE$	1
10380	The critical interactions these two residues make with the @GENE$ were observed in our modelling experiment documenting that both residues form VDW interactions with Y472	1
10381	The end result of our study was a cyclic peptide , cyc - LHSPW that was a potent and specific inhibitor of @GENE$	1
10382	By inhibiting the enzymatic activity of @GENE$ , we found that cyc - LHSPW was therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo in a model of highly aggressive @DISEASE$	1
10383	With this aggressive form of @DISEASE$ on the rise , it is highly plausible the future treatments for @DISEASE$ could involve targeting APN 30 .@GENE$ 	1

10386	Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenge@GENE$ re@GENE$ f EV71 and CVA16 ) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$	1
10387	In this study , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody @GENE$ f @GENE$ effectively inhibited the @DISEASE$ - like skin scurfs in mice pre - infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 ( B4 genotype ) or prevented severe @DISEASE$ and death in mice pre - inoculated with 5746 ( C2 genotype )	1
10388	This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain , spinal cord and limb muscles	1
10389	Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro - inflammatory cytokine@GENE$ ective efficacy of N3 was not observed in anim@GENE$  challenged with CVA16	1
10390	This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found @GENE$ lts indicate N3 could be useful in treat@GENE$  severe @DISEASE$ and the hSCARB2 - transgenic mouse could @GENE$ to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti - enterovirus agent candidates .	1
10391	In this airplane section , the airflow pattern in the steady - state was simulated and used as the initial condition	1
10392	Then , five cases under different human movement pattern assumptions were investigated	1
10393	Case 1 ~ 3 were used to simulate the cough when the index patient was seated at 9E , which is also the injection location	1
10394	A no - movement case was used to simulate the aerosol dispersion in the airplane cabin without human movement	1
10395	Two more cases were simulated to study the aerodynamic effects of human movement , in which the standing person started to move along the aisle 1 s after the aerosol injections at moving speeds of 0	1
10396	5 m / s and 1	1

10399	5 m / s and coughed at 3 s and 6 s after the Back and front surface Periodic Escape movement began , respectively	1
10400	Since the aisle in the Boeing airplane is much longer than this computational geometry and the moving person may moves from a further area outside this computational geometry , the walking speed of the moving person can be assumed remain the same during the movement in this computational geometry [ 9 ]	1
10401	The walking speed profile of the moving person is an even - speed profile [ 8 ]	1
10402	The investigated cases are given in Table 4 .	1
10403	Although infection and replication of parvoviruses kill host cells , the extent of cell death strongly depends on the type of the host cell	1
10404	For instance , neoplastic cells are preferentially killed over normal cells 11 , 12	1
10405	Due to this	1
10406	From the lack of effect of the KH2 mutation on @GENE$ , we conclude that interaction of this domain with RNA does not occur ( or is unnecessary for @GENE$ ) and that mutations within the @GENE$ of @GENE$ do not compromise the specific interaction with @GENE$	1
10407	However , the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA , and conceivably , with @GENE$	1
10408	EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding , which was reduced in the case of @GENE$ , abolished with @GENE$ and largely unaffected for @GENE$ ( Figure 5E )	1
10409	Similar results were seen with @GENE$ ( Supplementary Figure S5 )	1
10410	To assess the capacity of the various @GENE$ to bind @GENE$ independently of RNA , a pull - down assay was utilized ( Supplementary Figure S6 )	1
10411	Here , immobilized @GENE$ was incubated with individual @GENE$ and , after a detergent wash , bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting	1
10412	In comparison to WT @GENE$ , the binding of @GENE$ bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to @GENE$ was unaffected , indicating that the effects on @GENE$ are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with @GENE$	1
10413	Indeed , @GENE$ all bound @GENE$ in this assay , thus the inability of @GENE$ to trans - activate @GENE$ at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation	1
10414	Importantly , @GENE$ RBM was able to pull - down @GENE$ , indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner .	1

10424	Viruses are pathogenic agents that cause potentially devastating diseases such as the @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]	1

10430	The use of quarantine as a control measure , although considered to be highly effective , is controversial	1
10431	A telephonebased survey in the Greater Toronto Area aiming to ascertain public perceptions of the use of quarantine found that while quarantine was perceived to be a necessary and effective strategy , its ethical implementation should involve the collaboration of policy - makers , public health organizations , and the general population , and should be closely regulated to ensure appropriate use and protection of individual rights ( Tracy et al	1
10432	2009 )	1
10433	Despite these recommendations , Toronto quarantined significantly more people during the @DISEASE$ outbreak compared to the other affected cities , including Hong Kong and Shanghai ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
10434	Given the reported psychological distress reported by those quarantined , Toronto might have considered other strategies , such as the use of face masks to better Bdistribute the burden of containment measures ( Jacob , 2007 , p	1
10435	532 )	1
10436	Critics note that the extensive quarantining in Toronto lacked proper policies and procedures to guide its implementation ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
10437	Others highlight a lack of public record detailing any consultation between public health officials and the Ontario Human Rights Commission ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
10438	There was little public scrutiny , which was suggested to be the result of effective conditioning of the public consciousness to believe that quarantining recommendations would be made fairly and legitimately by senior public health officials ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
10439	Ultimately , it was not quarantining that was problematic , but the lack of apparent or sufficient evidence to guide its implementation	1
10440	Beyond extensive quarantining , The World Health Organization issued travel - advisories as an additional control measure to contain further national and international spread of @DISEASE$ from Toronto ( Paquin 2007 )	1
10441	This travel - advisory cost Toronto $ 1	1
10442	1 billion and restricted the international right for freedom of movement ( Paquin 2007 )	1
10443	Paquin ( 2009 ) criticizes these travel - advisories for various reasons	1
10444	For example , the advisories were not made by the WHO in consultation with Toronto authorities and led to an uneven global distribution of the burden of @DISEASE$ ( Paquin 2007 )	1
10445	Furthermore , the travel advisories were based on old data resulting from delayed communication between the federal government of Canada and the WHO , as information had to first travel from municipal to provincial to federal health authorities ( Paquin 2007 )	1
10446	Once again , the evidence used to inform the response was outdated and therefore considered unjustified	1
10447	As such , there were problems with both the lack of quality evidence and the travel advisory as a response .	1
10448	Upadhyay et a l	1
10449	demonstrated that @GENE$ is moderately immunogenic mainly due to its penetratin moiety [ 100 ]	1
10450	@GENE$ secretion profiles of the lymph node cells showed elevated levels of @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ , which are known to promote proliferation of T lymphocytes and slow down the death of CD4 + T cells	1
10451	The authors emphasize that these immunogenic properties of the conjugate could prove to be beneficial to the host .	1
10452	Consequently , the structural comparison between the human sialidases @GENE$ and the @GENE$ suggests that the interaction between @GENE$ and diplacone is likely to be unfavourable owing to polar or ionic repulsion .	1

10456	@GENE$ and @GENE$ for these proteins were identified using the approach suggested previously	1
10457	27 , 28 For a given protein , information related to the start and end of @GENE$ , actual @GENE$ , PSSM score ( Position specific scoring matrix ) , similar @GENE$ and presence or absence @GENE$ and @GENE$ in @GENE$ were obtained .	1
10458	Iterative HFold is distinguished from the above three methods , namely HFold , HFold - PKonly and @GENE$ , in two important ways	1
10459	First , the output of HFold , HFold - PKonly and SimFold methods must contain the given pseudoknot - free input structure , G , whereas Iterative HFold may modify the input structure	1
10460	This can be useful when the given input structure is not a high - accuracy estimate of G big , the true pseudoknot - free substructure of the reference structure	1
10461	Second , while HFold and HFold - PKonly can add @GENE$ that cross those in G , they cannot add @GENE$ that cross each other , and neither can @GENE$	1
10462	In contrast , Iterative HFold can add @GENE$ that cross each other	1
10463	This is particularly useful when the input structure contains limited information about G big , and so it is necessary both to predict @GENE$ in G big and in G small in order to get a good prediction .	1
10464	There are eight cases in this data set for which the original sequence and structure were shortened to accommodate restrictions in length	1
10465	We removed them from our data set , resulting in a set of size 425	1
10466	From now on we use " @GENE$ " to refer to the pseudoknotted structures in this set ( with 88 structures ) and " @GENE$ " to refer to the pseudoknot - free structures in this set ( with 337 structures )	1
10467	@GENE$ in @GENE$ and @GENE$ - free have length between 10 and 400 nucleotides .	1
10468	To identify individual risk factors for @DISEASE$ , we fit a single GLMM with bat age , forearm size , sex , and reproductive status ; we also included interactions between sex and reproduction , sex and age , sex and forearm size , and reproduction and forearm size	1
10469	We included categorical livestock biomass as a predictor in the GLMM to control for a previously observed negative association with @DISEASE$ ( 121 / 173 positive bats ) [ 49 ]	1
10470	We fit this GLMM to a reduced dataset free of missing values ( n = 189 ) , included bat ID nested within site as a random effect , and calculated marginal R 2 ( R 2 m ) to assess model fit [ 62 ]	1
10471	Finally , for a data subset ( n = 40 bats sampled in Peru in 2016 ) , we fit two separate GLMs with bat fly intensity and presence as predictors to test whether ectoparasites explained @DISEASE$ status	1
10472	We fit a separate GLM with quasi - Poisson errors to test for sex and age differences in bat fly intensity .	1

10483	Importantly , resting mucosal tissue resident macrophages have been described to have an " M2 - like " functional status resembling that of IL - 4 - polarized macrophages ( 40 , 41 )	1
10484	We therefore tested the infectivity of JEV released from NEC cultures for both nonpolarized and IL - 4 - polarized macrophages	1
10485	To also assess potential additional factors released from the infected NEC cultures , we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from Vero cell - propagated virus	1
10486	Of note , the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) .	1

10490	These microbiological findings and the presence of a pronounced @DISEASE$ in BAL - fluid , sampled in patients not presenting an acute exacerbation episode , favours the hypothesis that @DISEASE$ is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent @DISEASE$ despite ICS therapy in these young patients	1
10491	These elements suggest that the use of antibiotic treatment , although not currently recommended , should be considered in selected young children presenting with @DISEASE$	1
10492	However , as these patients are indistinguishable without the use of invasive procedures , and biofilm formation and other escape mechanisms may decrease the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotic treatment , additional research is necessary before specific treatment recommendations can be provided	1
10493	Future research should focus on population characteristics , determination of risk factors for acquisition of @DISEASE$ , pathogenicity mechanisms of @DISEASE$ and possible prevention and treatment strategies .	1
10494	The initiation phase involves homolytic breakdown of hydrogen in the α - position relative to the fatty acid chain double bond , leading to the formation of an allyl radical	1
10495	These species are highly unstable , short - lived intermediates that stabilize themselves by abstracting hydrogen from another chemical species or rapidly react with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical ( propagation phase )	1
10496	In the propagation phase , peroxyl radicals formed can further oxidise the lipid , producing hydroperoxides .	1
10497	The life cycle of retroviruses is characterized by the reverse transcription of their @GENE$ into DNA and subsequent integration of this @GENE$ as provirus into the genome of the host , causing permanent infection most often accompanied by persistent virus production by infected cells	1
10498	The @DISEASE$ virus ( FeLV ) , a @DISEASE$ that can be propagated on FEA cells in vitro , affects domestic cats worldwide	1
10499	As viral replication in chronically infected cats can be lowered by treatment with IFNα [ 67 ] @GENE$  potential of Sup 2216 pro@GENE$ the PBMCs of five adult cats ( c06 and c08 from group 2 ; c09 , c10 , c12 from group 3 ) to inhibit productive infection of FEA cells was analyzed	1
10500	In initial experiments , this cell line exhibited similar responses as fcwf - 4 and CrFK cells to both direct treatment with ODN 2216 and incubation with the different supernatants ( Figure 3A , 4C and D and data not shown )	1
10501	Compared to incubation with medium alone , treatment of FEA cells with Sup 2216 for@GENE$ h prior to inoculation with FeLV followed by repetitive treatments of the cells with this supernatant every 2 days thereafter significantly reduced viral RNA ( @GENE$  ) and DNA ( p < 0	1
10502	05 ) Figure 6A and B )	1
10503	The antiviral potential of the supernatants from the individual cats was very similar ; however the best results were conferred by the Sup 2216 der@GENE$  cells of c08 ( depicted in Figure 6A and B )	1
10504	The kinetic curve of viral RNA lo@GENE$ tures of cells treated with Sup 2216 of this cat was similar to those obtained in cells treated with 50U rfeIFNα ( da@GENE$ hown )	1
10505	Also , treatment of the cells with ODN 2216 directly affected neither viral RNA no@GENE$ A loads measured in the supernatants and the cells respectively ( data not shown )	1
10506	Mx mRNA expr@GENE$ as 80 - fold higher in the Sup 2216 treated cells than in all controls 8 days post inoculation , indicating the ability of these supernatants to sustain antiviral mechanisms when applied to the cells repeatedly ( Figure 6C )	1
10507	Furthermore at this time point , the Sup 2216 treated cells exhibited significantly lower viral DNA lo@GENE$ p = 0	1
10508	0313 ) and produced significantly less virus ( p = 0	1
10509	0313 ) than cells treated with Sup 2243 , Sup Neg or medium alone ( Figure 6D and E )	1
10510	The extent of Mx transcription conferred by the Sup 2216 of the cats strongly correlated with lower provirus ( p = 0	1
10511	0053 ) and virus ( p = 0	1
10512	0012 ) loads measured in the FEA cells and supernatants respectively on day 8 post inoculation ( p = 0	1
10513	0053 )	1
10514	Also , the highest Mx mRNA levels in target cells were conferred by Sup 2216 of cat c08 and reflected by the lowest viral and proviral loads measured at this time point in our experiments .	1
10515	This point is further illustrated by the ratio of percenttranscytosed : percent - infectious virus ( Figure 3E )	1
10516	For example , for every infectious unit , about 30 times more virus is transcytosed with @GENE$ than with HIVIG ( Figure 3E )	1
10517	Note that independently of transcytosis , HIV - 1 JRLF infectivity on TZM - bl cells increased about 3	1

10528	Human Health Some participants stated the importance of raising @DISEASE$ awareness to counter its emergence	1
10529	It was suggested that by raising awareness of the topic and getting more funds to drive @DISEASE$ programs for the general population and stakeholders alike , @DISEASE$ emergence could be tackled better .	1
10530	( @GENE$ )	1
10531	This study had several limitations	1
10532	First , the survey was conducted 7	1
10533	3 months after the @DISEASE$ outbreak , making recall bias possible	1
10534	Second , it is possible that we missed some mild or asymptomatic cases	1
10535	Furthermore , because the serological tests were performed several months post - exposure , pre - exis@GENE$ ntibodies may have decreased or disappeared in the interval , potentially leading to underestimation	1
10536	While asymptomatic @DISEASE$ infection had been detected using RT - PCR testing at the time of outbreak , 9 a Saudi Arabian study showed th@GENE$ CoV antibodies in @DISEASE$ patients varied in the severity of illn@GENE$ xample , antibodies in severely infected patients persisted after 18 months , but milder and subclinical cases detected no antibodies even early on in the disease	1
10537	10 Third , the number of participants was relatively small and may not be representative or generalizable	1
10538	Despite these limitations , this study suggests that the risk of @DISEASE$ transmission to public health professionals responding to @DISEASE$ outside the hospital setting ( i	1
10539	e	1
10540	patients ' homes ) was low , particularly for those who wore some level of PPE such as masks and gloves	1
10541	Further study is needed to prospectively survey public health responders including symptomatic or asymptomatic cases to conduct genetic test and serologic test during an outbreak .	1
10542	• The paper refers throughout to " optimization "	1

10558	By contrast , we found only moderate agreement between qualitative results of SADV detected in tissues by TEM and our assay results ( k value = 0	1
10559	39 , n = 15 ; red squirrel SADV assay )	1
10560	In fact , none of the grey squirrel tissues tested ( n = 5 ) showed evidence of SADV viral particles by TEM , which was not surprising due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection in the grey squirrel	1
10561	By contrast , the k value between the developed red and grey squirrel SADV assays was 1 and it showed a strong correlation between quantitative results ( r = 1	1
10562	00 , n = 15 )	1
10563	Our uniplex and multiplex assays gave the same information about whether samples were positive or negative ( k value = 1	1

10578	Despite the obvious advantages of multiplex PCR assays , they are still relatively underused compared with uniplex PCRs , possibly because of a persistent belief that multiplex assays require heavy investment into their setup and optimisation ( Elnifro et al	1

10580	The methods used here , however , allowed development of assays that are reliable , analytically sensitive and specific and thus fulfil the required criteria for a diagnostic qPCR assay ( Bustin et al	1

10593	We did a similar , but much larger analysis of mutation accumulation in all human H1N1 strains from 1918 to 2012 , using the @GENE$ ( A / Brevig Mission / 1 / 1918 ) as a reference	1
10594	This sequence was missing the last 480 nucleotides of @GENE$	1
10595	We amended this by appending the ending sequence of another 1918 H1N1 virus , A / South Carolina / 1 / 18 ( H1N1 )	1
10596	These two strains had only one nucleotide difference in the @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( C / T at @GENE$ )	1
10597	Thus , they are essentially identical and we do not expect to have introduced extra mutations in this way .	1
10598	The most conserved inhibition of the type I IFN system within the Flaviviridae family is the antagonism of @GENE$ signaling carried out by @GENE$ ; this mechanism is conserved between several mosquito and tick - borne flaviviruses [ 148 , [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ]	1

10604	Data were expressed as mean 6 standard deviation or median and 25 - 75 % interquartile range according to data distribution	1
10605	Categorical variables were compared using the chi - square test or Fisher ' s exact test as appropriate	1
10606	Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were constructed to determine the performances of BAL fluid cellular components , @GENE$ concentration , and @GENE$ concentration for predicting @DISEASE$	1
10607	Youden ' s Index ( sensitivity + specificity - 1 ) [ 18 ] was used to select the optimal cutoff points of the ROC curve	1
10608	Area under the curve ( AUC ) , sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were calculated	1
10609	For positiveand negative predictive values , the prevalence of @DISEASE$ in severe @DISEASE$ patients admitted to the medical ICU was assumed to be 35	1

10622	Of these patients , 100 were excluded because the pathogen was not identified , 42 were excluded because BAL fluid analysis was not possible ( due to severe @DISEASE$ or specimen clotting ) or not performed , 52 were excluded because two or more types of pathogens were identified , and 100 were excluded because they received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL	1
10623	Ten patients with @DISEASE$ , 5 patients with @DISEASE$ , and 3 patients with @DISEASE$ were also excluded	1
10624	Finally , 47 patients ( 24 with @DISEASE$ and 23 with @DISEASE$ ) were included .	1
10625	Three distinct classes of @GENE$ , type I ( @GENE$ ) , type II ( @GENE$ ) , and type III IFN ( @GENE$ ) have been described	1
10626	The expression of the @GENE$ and @GENE$ are restricted , but the @GENE$ can be expressed by most cell types and their receptor , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is expressed on all nucleated cells [ 107 ]	1
10627	There are 17 different type @GENE$ in humans ; these @GENE$ are produced by cells upon recognition of @GENE$ , which are foreign to the host cell [ 95 , 108 ] , and mediates antiviral activity by autocrine and paracrine signaling through @GENE$ [ 109 , 110 ]	1
10628	Signaling through @GENE$ induces an antiviral state by the expression of hundreds of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 111 , 112 ] .	1
10629	During September 2016 to September 2018 , we conducted a survey of @DISEASE$ in domestic dogs in small animal hospitals in 5 provinces of Thailand ( Bangkok , Nakhon Ratchasima , Ratchaburi , Suphanburi , and Tak )	1
10630	We tested 307 rectal swab samples for CaKoV by using one - step RT - PCR specific to 3D gene	1
10631	Bas@GENE$ two - year survey , we found CaKoV positivity at 17	1

10634	44 % ( 49 / 252 ) ) and healthy ( 9	1
10635	09 % ( 5 / 55 ) ) animals	1
10636	Our result showed no seasonal pattern of @DISEASE$ infection in dogs ( Figs	1
10637	1 and 2 )	1
10638	In relation to age group , @DISEASE$ could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 25	1
10639	45 % ( 42 / 165 ) ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 )	1
10640	The coinfections of CaKoV with other enteric viral pathogens were observed including CaKoV / Canine parvovirus / Canine Coronavirus ( n = 6 ) , CaKoV / Canine parvovirus ( n = 20 ) and CaKoV / Canine Coronavirus ( n = 2 )	1
10641	In this study , 12 CaKoVs were selected and characterized by whole genome sequencing ( n = 4 ) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing ( n = 8 )	1
10642	The viruses were selected to represent epidemiological and demographic data such as age , date of isolation and breed	1
10643	In this study , nucle@GENE$ e CaKoV were submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK201776 - MK201795 ( Table 1 ) .	1
10644	Several experiments suggest that @GENE$ loss - offunction affects the GABAergic system	1
10645	First , hippocampal immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of the GABA synthesis enzyme @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in @GENE$ mutants ( Tomida et al	1
10646	, 2009 ) , suggesting that @GENE$ may regulate GABA synthesis	1
10647	Second , muscimol - induced postsynaptic @GENE$ receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of @GENE$ mutants	1
10648	This effect may be mediated by @GENE$ since no alterations were observed in mIPSC amplitude or frequency ( Tomida et al	1
10649	, 2009 )	1
10650	Third , administration of the @GENE$ agonist , nitrazepam , restores @DISEASE$ behavior in USP46 ( @GENE$ and KO mutant mice , and these effects could be blocked by the GABA A r@GENE$ st flumazenil ( Imai et al	1
10651	, 2012 )	1
10652	Together , these data suggest that USP46 af@GENE$ both preand postsynaptic components of the GABA system , however the precise mechanism is not known	1
10653	One possibility is that USP46 ma@GENE$ rectly affect the GABA system as a compensatory response to a primary defect in AMPAR de@GENE$ ion in excitatory neurons	1
10654	It will be important in the future to test if USP46 fu@GENE$ s in GABA neurons and whether it directly deubiquitinates components of the GABA system .	1
10655	Prior to enrollment , all the children were examined for clinical signs and symptoms by attending physicians to suspect @DISEASE$	1
10656	The suspected patients were then subjected to chest X - ray	1
10657	62 % ( n = 124 ) of hospitalized symptomatic children were male , while the rest 38 % were female	1
10658	The mean age of the symptomatic children was 9	1
10659	6 months and 47 % ( n = 94 ) of children were under six months of age and 78	1
10660	5 % ( n = 157 ) were less than one year old	1
10661	On the other hand , the mean age of the asymptomatic children was 12	1
10662	62 months	1
10663	All the children including their parents / guardians were residents of Dhaka city .	1
10664	According to data reported to the World Health Organization , the rates of asymptomatic or mild infection were 44 of 398 ( 28	1
10665	60 % ) in Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , and the Islamic Republic of Iran between April and June 2014 , and 32 of 113 ( 28	1
10666	31 % ) in Saudi Arabia in June 2014 [ 12 , 13 ]	1
10667	However , Oboho et al	1
10668	[ 14 ] reported that 78	1
10669	79 % ( 26 of 33 ) of initially reported asymptomatic patients had at least 1 symptom	1
10670	In Korea , among the 186 confirmed cases , 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests ( 1	1
10671	61 % ) [ 15 ]	1
10672	In serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence tests for healthcare workers who were at @DISEASE$ - affected hospitals , 2 of 457 ( 0	1
10673	44 % ) had positive results [ 16 ]	1
10674	However , no report has been published regarding the asymptomatic infection rate among non - healthcare workers in Korea	1
10675	There is a considerable chance of human - to - human transmission , as well as direct infection via the dromedary camel [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]	1
10676	Therefore , it is necessary to identify the rate of asymptomatic @DISEASE$ in healthcare workers and non - healthcare workers .	1
10677	In view of the modest existing drug arsenal , the continuing threat posed by viral pathogens urgently calls for the development of novel antiviral agents	1
10678	As obligate intracellular parasites , viruses present formidable challenges to drug development , the biggest being the in vivo delivery of the antiviral drug into the infected cells , with minimum toxicity to the host cells [ 6 ] .	1
10679	One function of ADP - ribosylation may be to regulate viral infectivity and pathogenesis , consistent with the role of other @GENE$ in immunity	1
10680	For example , both @DISEASE$ [ 17 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 18 ] require ADP - ribosylation activity for viral replication	1
10681	Moreover , diverse RNA viruses , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ encode one or more macrodomains , potentially conferring @GENE$ o specifically recognize , and possibly reverse , ADPribosylation upon these viruses [ 19 ]	1
10682	Mutations in the macrodomain of Sindbis virus led to re@GENE$ nce in mice [ 20 ]	1
10683	Similarly , mutations in the SARS coronavirus macrodomain sensitized the virus to the antiviral effects of the signaling cytokine , interferon ( IFN @GENE$ un@GENE$ ne@GENE$ the primary me@GENE$ ors of the innate immune system against viruses [ 22 ] , these results indicate that macrodomains , and therefore ADP - rib@GENE$ ould be important viral regulators of host immunity	1
10684	Moreover , host PARP genes can play a direct role@GENE$ munity	1
10685	For example , overexpression of PARP13 , also known as ZAP or ZC3HAV1 @GENE$ - finger CCCH - @GENE$  an@GENE$ pr@GENE$ ion of several different families of viruses , including a @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ [ 23 ] ) , @DISEASE$ ( Ebola and Marburg [ 24 ] ) , a @DISEASE$ ( Sindbis [ 25 ] ) and a @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ [ 26 ] )	1
10686	This antiviral activity is mediated through direct binding of viral RNA by PARP13 , followed by recruitment of the exosome and specific deg@GENE$ n of viral RNA [ 27 , 28 ] , although more recently , additional sign@GENE$ s for PARP13 have been proposed [ 14 , 29 ]	1
10687	Beyond the welldescribed@GENE$  - mediated antiviral functions , PARP1 , 7 , 10 and 12 ha@GENE$  shown to play roles in repressin@GENE$ l replication [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , although the mechanisms of these antiviral actions are unknown	1
10688	While these results indicate that there may be a role for individual PARPs in regulating viral infectivity or pathogenesis , there has been no cohesive model for how ADP - ribosylation may influence host - viral interactions .	1
10689	Rapamycin	1
10690	With low nephrotoxicity and potential anticancer properties , rapamycin has been increasingly used in the transplantation context [ 47 ]	1
10691	It has been well known that rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein @GENE$ to form a complex	1
10692	This complex inhibits the @GENE$ pathway by directly binding to the @GENE$ , resulting in blockage of cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and thereby causing inhibition of T cell proliferation	1
10693	Intriguingly , rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibiting @GENE$	1
10694	Autophagy is a process for catabolizing organelles and other intracellular components to balance cellular metabolism and to promote cell survival during stressful conditions	1
10695	In fact , autophagy is also an important event in the regulation of the cellular response against @DISEASE$ [ 48 ]	1
10696	It is noteworthy that @DISEASE$ infection induces autophagy in the hepatocytes via the u@GENE$ esponse , and the autophagy induced by HCV is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes [ 49 ]	1
10697	The autophagosomes will not be degraded but instead support viral replication	1
10698	Recent study demonstrated that N@GENE$ ould directly interact with the h@GENE$ o induce the autophagy [ 50 ]	1
10699	In addition , the HCV - induced autophagy may promote infection by reducing the innate immunity [ 51 ]	1
10700	Based on these findings , it is conceivable that rapamycin could affect @DISEASE$ recurrence and antiviral interferon therapy	1
10701	However , clinical evidence is needed to make sure of its in vivo effect .	1
10702	The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation or as the median [ interquartile range ] for continuous variables and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables	1
10703	The data were analyzed using Kolmogorov - Smirnov tests for normal distribution	1
10704	The data were compared using the Mann - Whitney U - test or Student ' s t - test for continuous variables and the χ 2 or Fisher ' s exact test for categorical variables	1
10705	Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23	1

10715	Several limitations of this study should be noted	1
10716	In the current MIA model , additional core features of @DISEASE$ , including restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns , were not investigated 73	1
10717	Thus , the effect of maternal H 2 administration on these symptoms remains unknown	1
10718	The @DISEASE$ may be evaluated at an older age than was described in the present model , however , this might require changing other factors including the timing of exposure	1
10719	Since the mouse brain is not considered to be fully mature until 3 weeks of age 74 , the interpretation of the results of behavioral tests in the present study requires considerable caution	1
10720	In addition , we could not avoid the detrimental effects of maternal separation required for the measurement of body weight on offspring development	1
10721	However , the separation was performed similarly for the offspring in all three groups , thus any effect should be minimal , and consistent across groups	1
10722	In humans , it is currently thought that the occurrence of multiple risk factors , including genetic mutations and postnatal exposure to inflammation or other environmental triggers , may be required for the onset of @DISEASE$ 1 , 38	1
10723	Before advancing the clinical application of H 2 , it should be investigated whether H 2 could exert similar effects in so called ' multi - hit ' models	1
10724	Finally , in the previous and present studies , maternal H 2 administration was performed prior to the LPS exposure ; thus , the therapeutic potential of H 2 remains unclear	1
10725	Therefore , it might be relevant to evaluate the therapeutic effects of H 2 by administering H 2 to dams after exposure to LPS and in offspring .	1
10726	In this report the LeishVet group presents an overview on current knowledge on @DISEASE$ in cats	1
10727	Moreover , recommendations on the diagnosis , treatment and monitoring , prognosis and prevention of @DISEASE$ are also described in order to standardize the management of this infection in cats	1
10728	These were constructed by combining a comprehensive review of evidence - based studies and case reports , clinical experience and critical consensus discussions	1
10729	The goal of this review is therefore to offer the veterinary practitioners an updated approach with recommendations on the management of @DISEASE$ in cats .	1

10733	positive selection analyses to identify an important @GENE$ in @GENE$ , we investigated whether any of the other 16 @GENE$ also show signatures of recurrent positive selection	1
10734	We searched publicly available @GENE$ sequences and identified orthologs of all 17 @GENE$ from a minimum of four hominoids , two Old World monkeys and one New World monkey	1
10735	We performed a series of maximum likelihood analyses to detect recurrent positive selection for each @GENE$ alignment	1
10736	These analyses determine whether a model allowing positive selection at a subset of amino acid residues is a statistically better fit to the sequence data than a model that does not allow for positive selection	1
10737	Using PAML software [ 40 ] , we found that five @GENE$ showed highly statistically significant ( p - values , 0	1
10738	0001 ) signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1B )	1
10739	In addition to confirming our earlier findings on @GENE$ , we found that @GENE$ ( also known as @GENE$ ) and the three @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) all show signatures of positive selection	1
10740	We followed up our PAML analyses with the more conservative @GENE$ software implemented in the HyPhy package [ 41 ] , which takes into account recombination and variation in synonymous substitution rates across @GENE$	1
10741	Using @GENE$ , we again found these five @GENE$ to be clearly distinct from the remaining 12 as judged by likelihood ratio tests ( LRT ) allowing or disallowing positive selection ( Figure 1B )	1
10742	While our limited screen of seven @GENE$ in @GENE$ only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0	1
10743	01 ) for @GENE$ and @GENE$ , analysis of additional sequences of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ met statistical significance ( see below )	1
10744	Finally , we performed branch - site analyses [ 42 ] to look for episodic signatures of positive selection on all 17 @GENE$	1
10745	We found that only @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ demonstrated statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection ( Figure S1 )	1
10746	This initial screen might underestimate the total number of @GENE$ evolving under positive selection , firstly because our search is restricted to the primate lineage ( selection might have operated only in other mammalian lineage ) and secondly because we use only seven orthologs	1
10747	Although such small alignments may lack power to detect weak selection , previous simulation studies have shown that strong selection on a subset of residues can be detected using 1 PARPs are categorized as either poly - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Poly - ) , mono - ADP - ribosyltransferases ( Mono - ) or inactive based on presence of conserved motifs and , when available , data using enzymatic assays [ 4 , 6 ]	1
10748	2 PARP9 and PARP13 lack one or more catalytic residues conserved in all other PARPs and are therefore predicted to lack catalytic activity , although it is unknown whether they still bind ADP - ribose or ADP - ribosylated proteins [ 4 ]	1

10750	The five PARP genes showing strong signatures of positive selection are shown in red	1
10751	Shown at left are values derived from PAML indicating twice the log difference between an evolutionary model that allows positive selection ( M8 ) versus a model that disallows position selection ( M8a )	1
10752	P - values indicate whether the model that allows positive selection better fits the data	1
10753	PARRIS - derived LRT ( likelihood ratio test ) values also report the difference between the log - likelihood values for a model allowing positive selection versus a model that does not	1
10754	Using seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p - value ( , 0	1
10755	01 ) for PARP4 and PARP13 , however analysis of additional sequences of PARP9 , 14 and 15 found that these genes also met statistical significance ( see Results )	1

10768	NO production and / or @GENE$ expression are also induced by inflammatory mediators in a wide variety of mammalian cells , producing large amounts of NO for prolonged time periods [ 25 ]	1
10769	@GENE$ catalises the production of large amount of NO from L - arginine and molecular oxygen , is mainly triggered and regulated by a series of signalling pathways including nuclear factor - κB ( NF - κB ) @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 116 ] .	1
10770	Likewise , the @DISEASE$ experience has sparked a renewed research interest in the ethics and effectiveness of quarantine	1
10771	The findings of two recent retrospective studies of the 1918 Spanish @DISEASE$ pandemic strongly suggest that it was non - pharmaceutical inventions such as quarantine and other social distancing measures that were most effective in slowing the rate of spread and minimizing the rate of death [ 8 , 9 ]	1
10772	And data from SARS - affected regions have pointed to the enduring value and effectiveness of quarantine and other restrictive measures [ 10 , 11 ]	1
10773	In contrast , there are those who argue that the use of quarantine during @DISEASE$ was both ineffective and inefficient [ 6 , 7 ]	1
10774	The advent of advanced statistical modelling has added a new dimension to this long - running debate [ 12 , 13 ] .	1
10775	The anti - inflammatory activity of essential oils may be attributed not only to their antioxidant activities but also to their interactions with signalling cascades involving @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and on the expression of @GENE$ .	1
10776	Outbreaks of @DISEASE$ have been occasionally reported in young adult women or military personnel [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
10777	@DISEASE$ is the leading cause of hospitalization of military trainees in the medical field	1
10778	A study by the US military showed that 10 % of recruits at boot camp were infected with Adv , and 90 % of patients with @DISEASE$ were infected with @DISEASE$ [ 10 , 11 ]	1
10779	In 2006 , a study by the South Korean military reported that the prevalence of @DISEASE$ was 61 % among military recruits with @DISEASE$ [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]	1
10780	@DISEASE$ caused by Adv may also progress to @DISEASE$	1
10781	Recently , several case series were reported describing recruits that died in boot camp due to severe @DISEASE$ in South Korea since 2012 [ 13 , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]	1
10782	Even if mortality results or clinical outcome of @DISEASE$ infection could be affected by selection bias , it has been reported that @DISEASE$ may be severe with a higher incidence of progression to @DISEASE$ compared to other viral etiologies with the exception of @DISEASE$	1
10783	Thus , some clinical data have been reported regarding predictive factors of @DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ [ 18 , 19 ] .	1
10784	@GENE$ interact with CD4 T - lymphocytes during bacterial eradication	1
10785	In severe @DISEASE$ , B and T cells are depleted due to apoptosis [ 25 ]	1
10786	Since our analysis is retrospective , we could not measu@GENE$ DR expression @GENE$ ne profiles in these patients	1
10787	However , we found a trend of increased lymphocytes in non - survivors compared to survivors , which may reflect why we did not see any beneficial effect of IVIG therapy	1
10788	Althou@GENE$ ns may play an important role in the innate immune response during @DISEASE$ , nonspecific immunoglobulins may not be as effective in a @DISEASE$ environment	1
10789	@DISEASE$ has been described in @DISEASE$ patients and in animal models after @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ and affects all lymphoid tissue [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]	1
10790	However , in our small group of [ 29 , 30 ] , but whether this variability in response is due to genetic alterations [ 31 ] , immune evasion by bacteria [ 32 ] , or different stages of @DISEASE$ is unknown	1
10791	This study has some limitations	1
10792	It is a retrospective analysis of a limited number of @DISEASE$ patients	1
10793	Since we changed our ECMO system during the study period , we only included patients treated with the one system to exclude any impact of system differences	1
10794	Furthermore , since IVIG was ordered by a physician primarily when a @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ was suspected , the IVIG group included more patients with these infections	1
10795	However , this may reflect true clinical circumstances in that the cause of disease is typically not determined at admission .	1

10819	To evaluate beat frequencies between the upper limit of normal ( approximately 16 Hz ) for respiratory cilia and the lower limit of normal for ependymal cilia ( approximately 36 Hz ) we slowed ependymal ciliary beat frequency by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin , pneumolysin	1
10820	We have previously shown pneumolysin to reduce ependymal ciliary beat frequency [ 4 ]	1
10821	Pneumolysin was purified as previously described [ 19 ]	1
10822	Cells were exposed to 1 ml M199 containing 300 ng of pneumolysin , which was preheated to 37 ° C	1
10823	The CBF was measured at intervals of 0 , 5 , and 15 minutes over the course of the experiment	1
10824	At each time point , images were captured from four different areas along the ciliated edge of the brain slice .	1
10825	@GENE$ : a research tool for automated , high - throughput measurement of ciliary beat frequency using freely available software	1
10826	Beyond underscoring combination therapy , viral escape mutants are powerful tools for understanding how antivirals function during viral infection	1
10827	By investigating how CVB3 escaped DFMO - mediated polyamine depletion , we observed novel mutations in @GENE$ that led us to investigate how polyamines contribute to viral @GENE$ activity	1
10828	Thus , these escape mutants have highlighted a novel function of polyamines during viral infection	1
10829	As described above , these results have implications for antiviral therapy , but they also inform our understanding of basic mechanisms in virology	1
10830	Additional mechanisms whereby polyamines function in virus infection may be observed using similar means to highlight how these relatively simple molecules contribute to infection in diverse ways .	1
10831	Recently , putative @GENE$ have been identified in some @DISEASE$ [ 3 , 67 ]	1
10832	This sequence is in an alt@GENE$ the nuc@GENE$ n other bunyaviruses , NSs@GENE$  anti - interferon activity [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] ; however , its role in @DISEASE$ is less well characterized .	1
10833	Appropriate Models for the Management of @DISEASE$ 	1
10834	Nurse ( N3 ) indicated that : " We have an urgent need for good quality equipment and personal measures such as N95 respiratory masks , gloves and protective clothes like those in theatres , to protect us from contracting infection with our clothes and expose our families to risks of contracting infection	1
10835	"	1
10836	The associations between qualitative variables were evaluated with Chi - square test	1
10837	Results were deemed as significant	1
10838	We found that the @GENE$ expression level was increased at 60 hpi	1
10839	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) are a group of proteins that respond to stress , including heat , hypoxia , irradiation , infection , or toxic agents 46	1
10840	HSP has been shown to influence apoptosis in @DISEASE$ cells , regulate p53 function , and induce an immune response to @DISEASE$ 47	1
10841	Incre@GENE$  HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis , but they also can increase immunity to @DISEASE$ 48	1
10842	For example , over - ex@GENE$ protein is suggested to promote @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ; for these @DISEASE$ , HSP60 inhibitors@GENE$ e used as anti - cancer agents [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ]	1
10843	Whereas , a loss of HSP60 immunoposi@GENE$  is related to the development and progression of @DISEASE$ in smokers with @DISEASE$ 52	1
10844	In this experiment , we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and @GENE$ P90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and@GENE$ 	1
10845	As the influence of the HSP expression changes due to different @DISEASE$ ,@GENE$  anti - cancer significance of the differential expression of HSPs in CPV - infected cells is complicated and r@GENE$ es further study .	1
10846	( Thermo Scientific [UNK] ) , containing a protease inhibitor cocktail , for 10 min under gentle shaking conditions	1
10847	The samples were centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 10 min , and the supernatants were collected	1
10848	The protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay	1
10849	@GENE$ labelling and peptide fractionation	1
10850	The @GENE$ labelling was conducted according to the protocol of the @GENE$ reagents ( 8 plex , Applied Biosystems )	1
10851	Briefly , the protein samples were thermally denatured , reduced , and alkylated prior to @GENE$ ( Promega ) digestion for 15 h	1
10852	The digested samples were labelled with each component of the @GENE$ reagent kit : two mock samples were labelled with 113 and 114 ; and five @DISEASE$ - infected samples collected at 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hpi were labelled with 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 , and 119 , respectively	1
10853	Three biological replicates were prepared for all samples	1
10854	Next , an equal ratio of each set was pooled for analysis .	1
10855	Other methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures , such as the IPknot method of Sato et al	1
10856	[ 42 ] , are motivated by the finding of Mathews [ 43 ] that @GENE$ with high base pairing probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble are more likely to be in the known structure	1
10857	In a comprehensive comparison performed by Puton et al	1
10858	[ 44 ] on the performance of publicly available non - comparative RNA secondary structure prediction methods that can handle pseudoknotted structures , @GENE$ ranks first for general length RNA sequences .	1
10859	All patients suffered from @DISEASE$ requiring vasopressor therapy ( control , 1 - 27 days vs	1
10860	IVIG , 2 - 42 days )	1
10861	Renal replacement therapy was more often required in the control group ( 54 % vs	1
10862	66 % ; p = 0	1
10863	36 ; Pearson ' s chi - squared test )	1
10864	@DISEASE$ was comparable between both groups ( control , 24 % ; IVIG , 21 % ) .	1
10865	Contemporary diagnostic tests for many pathogens rely on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) as assays often yield excellent sensitivity and specificity ( for both fresh and archived samples ) and in less time than many traditional assays ( Cai Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( doi : 10	1
10866	1007 / s10344 - 016 - 1031 - z ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users	1
10867	et al	1
10868	2014 )	1
10869	In particular , quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) combines high - throughput sample processing with increased sensitivity and reduced potential for contamination ( Klein 2002 )	1
10870	However , PCR can be prone to inhibition in all formats ( Brankatschk et al	1
10871	2012 ; Schrader et al	1
10872	2012 ) and quality control is therefore vital during assay development and processing ( Borst et al	1
10873	2004 ; Burkardt 2000 ; Lo and Chan 2006 )	1
10874	One key quality control measure is to include an internal control ( IC ) to minimise occurrence of false - negative results	1
10875	ICs that consist of a known @GENE$ , added to the sample prior to or post - DNA purification ( exogenous IC ) , are often convenient ( e	1
10876	g	1
10877	in commercial kits ) but may impair assay sensitivity ( Cai et al	1
10878	2014 )	1
10879	Alternatively , a region of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) can be used as an IC ( endogenous IC ) to verify the absence of PCR inhibitors during sample processing ; using an endogenous control prevents the need to add foreign DNA to the qPCR and allows calculation of relative quantity of target DNA	1
10880	Internal endogenous controls are frequently used in gene expression studies but rarely used in pathogen detection assays	1
10881	Multiplex PCRs can be used to detect simultaneously the target and @GENE$ and thus save time and costs ( Cai et al	1
10882	2014 ; Elnifro et al	1
10883	2000 ) .	1
10884	Coronaviruses are single stranded , positive sense RNA viruses , which induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes upon infection of a host cell	1
10885	This provides the virus with a platform for the assembly of @GENE$ , improving efficiency of RNA synthesis	1
10886	The membranes observed in @DISEASE$ infected cells include double membrane vesicles	1
10887	By nature of their double membrane , these vesicles resemble cellular autophagosomes , generated during the cellular autophagy pathway	1
10888	In addition , coronavirus infection has been demonstrated to induce autophagy	1
10889	Here we review current knowledge of coronavirus induced membrane rearrangements and the involvement of autophagy or autophagy protein mi@GENE$ LC@GENE$ in coronavirus replication .	1
10890	It is important to consider not only the size of the simulated epidemics , but also how well the model captures the spatial spread of infection when partially sampled networks are used	1
10891	When epidemics are seeded in Cumbria , almost all infected movements occur within Cumbria itself and to neighbouring counties ( figure 3 )	1
10892	An average of 8	1
10893	9 farms become infected in Cumbria after 12 weeks , with 13	1
10894	9 in North Yorkshire and 4	1
10895	2 , 4	1
10896	0 , 4	1
10897	0 and 8	1
10898	0 in Durham , Lancashire , Dumfries and Galloway , and Aberdeen , respectively	1
10899	All other counties have epidemic sizes of fewer than two farms when the epidemic is seeded in Cumbria .	1
10900	Simulations are carried out in the same way as detailed in § 2d with the one exception that we only run outbreaks for the length of one infectious period	1
10901	The increased transmissibility from the inclusion of markets results in substantially larger epidemics , and therefore one infectious cycle is sufficient to analyse the effects of the different sampling methods .	1
10902	Nurse ( N2 ) showed concern and said : " the hospital doesn ' t even appreciate us for the good work that we are doing by risking our lives daily	1
10903	We do not even get a danger allowance in case we contract infection in the wards	1
10904	Instead we are being told that if we are found with @DISEASE$ we would be moved to another ward which is not a @DISEASE$ ward	1
10905	" Nurse ( N1 ) further indicated that : " we do not have @DISEASE$ awareness campaign , even just for a day , where the management just appreciates us for the great work that we are doing	1
10906	At times I even consider other opportunities	1
10907	Even the families of patients blame us for everything that goes wrong with the patients they do not appreciate the effort we put to care for the patients	1
10908	"	1
10909	Nurse ( N5 ) commented positively saying that : " we do receive full support that we need in the wards from the managers	1
10910	But we are happy of the fact that the hospital CEO does support us , and the nursing service manager gives us support	1
10911	"	1
10912	Although identifying the causes of pathogen spread is of great importance in spatial epidemiology , integrating this information in evolutionary models also offers major advantages for phylogeographic reconstructions and their relevance to @DISEASE$ surveillance and pandemic preparedness	1
10913	By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread , our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history , which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses	1
10914	Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection , different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [ 3 , 14 , 17 ]	1
10915	This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology	1
10916	The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [ 3 ] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence	1
10917	Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data , and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct , statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [ 3 ]	1
10918	Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia , our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006 , and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period	1
10919	The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration	1
10920	Moreover , we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates	1
10921	Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables	1
10922	For example , in the analysis presented here , we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread	1
10923	Rather , it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time - homogeneous model of lineage movement	1
10924	Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time .	1
10925	All of the quantitative results were calculated as copies / µL equivalents and then normalized as copies / 0	1

10929	Birds started showing signs of the disease on day 3 pi and gradually recovered by day 6 - 7 pi	1
10930	To compare egg production between groups on a weekly basis , daily values were averaged ( Figure 1 ) and are here expressed as laying rates ( % ) , considering a production of 10 eggs / 10 hens / day as a hypothetical value of 100 %	1
10931	Before the infection , all of the layers in the H9 and K groups laid eggs scoring a mean production of 93	1
10932	0 % and 95	1
10933	0 % , respectively and we did not observe any statistical difference between the two groups .	1

10936	The hallmarks of astrocytic activation include the development of a @DISEASE$ morphology with fewer processes and upregulation of int@GENE$ articularly gli@GENE$ n the Control group , some GFAP - positive cells were detected , most of which were in the resting state ( Fig	1
10937	4B , panels a , d )	1
10938	Compared with the Control group , a significantly increased number of activated astrocytes , characterized by a large soma and fewer processes ( thus obtaining a more rounded shape ) , was observed in the white matter and amygdala of the LPS - treated offspring ( p < 0	1
10939	05 and p < 0	1
10940	001 , respectively ; Fig	1
10941	4B , panel b , e and 4D )	1
10942	To evaluate the @DISEASE$ soma , the cellular size of the astrocytes was also quantified by calculating the ratio of GFAP i@GENE$ stained area to the number of GFAP - positive cells	1
10943	Larger soma were observed in the white matter of LPS - exposed mouse brains ( p < 0	1
10944	05 ; Fig	1

10946	Although the number of GFAP - positive cells was unchanged following H 2 treatment , the size of the GFAP - positive cells was significantly reduced in the white matter ( p < 0	1

10953	What are the most common dermatological findings of FeL due to L	1
10954	infantum and to other @DISEASE$ species ?	1
10955	These observed sequence conservation in @GENE$ is not unusual and is suggestive of functional and structural constraints on diversity , but less expected of the @GENE$ because of its status as a @GENE$ , similar to its close ' relative ' RSV [ 22 ]	1
10956	It has also been suggested that the low diversity in @GENE$ might make a substantial contribution to cross - neutralization and cross - protection between the HMPV subgroups [ 21 ]	1
10957	The relatively high frequency of amino acid diversity in G ( and to a lesser extent SH ) could be attributable to selective pressure for amino acid change coming from host immunity ; and the ability of the protein to tolerate substitutions , which might be due to its proposed extended , unfolded nature [ 22 ]	1
10958	The phylogenetic incongruence observed between @GENE$ and the @GENE$ and @GENE$ trees , is as reported previously for HMPV [ 23 ] , and could be attributed to differential rates of evolution , selection pressure or past recombination events [ 24 ]	1
10959	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ in hospitalized pediatric population in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya has been reported [ 7 , 25 ]	1
10960	However , it is notable that in recent years , @DISEASE$ has been detected at low prevalence in Kilifi ( unpublished observations from hospital - based pneumonia surveillance )	1
10961	Whether this low prevalence is due to reduced virus transmission , or decreased sensitivity of our HMPV molecular diagnostic assay due to progressive primer / probe mismatches , is yet to be established .	1
10962	We have demonstrated the utility of workflow systems by designing a pipeline that starts with data input by the biologist	1
10963	Once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated	1
10964	In particular these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of sequences to the distribution of the output to various algorithms , distributing the relevant outputs to different servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible , and finally visualizing the output	1
10965	Such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical data .	1

10970	Much like its counterparts in other systems , @GENE$ is only catalytically active when bound to two @GENE$ , @GENE$ , which is homologous to @GENE$ , and @GENE$ , which is homologous to @GENE$	1
10971	Interestingly , @GENE$ stability and subcellular localization can be regulated by interaction with the @GENE$	1

10974	To assess the capabilities of cross - neutralization of N3 against genotype B4 - and C2 strains of EV71 , various concentrations of N3 ( beginning with 50 mg ) were incubated with either E59 ( B4 ) or 5746 ( C2 ) before infecting NIH3T3 cells constituting expressed @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 18 ]	1
10975	The @GENE$ in infected 3T3 - SCARB2 cells were detected by RT - PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to @GENE$ of @GENE$ of E59 or 5746 isolates	1
10976	The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of @GENE$ of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner	1

10982	However , a disappointing antibiotic resistance pattern for S	1

10987	pneumaniae in vitro ( Table 1 ) .	1
10988	Limited information exists regarding MERS - CoV seroprevalence among populations other than confirmed @DISEASE$ cases	1
10989	Saudi Arabian data showed that the seroprevalenc@GENE$  IgG among the general population was 0	1
10990	15 % [ 25 ] , suggesting that a number of cases of asymptomatic or mild infections may be present in the general population .	1
10991	In mammals , the pulmonary myocardium forms an atriovenous junction where the atrial myocardium extends into the vena cavae and pulmonary veins , forming a sleeve of myocardial tissue around the veins ( Nathan and Eliakim 1966 )	1
10992	This myocardial sleeve is thought to maintain venous pressure and prevent blood reflux from the atrium during contraction ( Nathan and Eliakim 1966 )	1
10993	Interestingly , autonomous electrical activity ( Brunton and Fayrer 1876 ) and ectopic beats originating from the pulmonary myocardium ( Chen et al	1
10994	1999 ) are implicated in @DISEASE$	1
10995	This is important because it has been estimated that @DISEASE$ affects	1
10996	33 million people globally ( Chugh et al	1

11000	A number of studies have attempted to characterize and define the involvement of the pulmonary myocardium in @DISEASE$ ( Chen et al .	1
11001	There are several studies that support our second hypothesis , that respiratory viruses can promote bacterial colonization of the LRT by certain commensals in the URT	1
11002	Viruses interact with bacteria and the host at various stages along the pathologic pathway to promote @DISEASE$ ( Table 3 )	1
11003	For example , virus can increase shedding of URT bacteria into the LRT : in vitro biofilm and murine studies suggest @DISEASE$ infection can lead to the dispersion of S	1
11004	pneumoniae biofilms , releasing virulent pneumococci for subsequent secondary infections in the LRT [ 88 , 89 ]	1
11005	When in a biofilm , S	1
11006	pneumoniae is less virulent ; capsule polysaccharide and pneumolysin production are reduced and synthesis of the bacterial adhesin @GENE$ increased [ 90 , 91 ]	1
11007	Viral infections also can promote bacterial adhesion to host cells [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ]	1
11008	Influenza and PIV promote bacterial adhesion with respiratory epithelium cells by cleaving sialic acid and exposing receptors on host cell oligosaccharide chains [ 95 , 96 ]	1
11009	In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest free sialic acid released by viral neuraminidas@GENE$ aling molecule@GENE$ ccal biofilm formation , nasopharyngeal colonization and bacterial spread to the lungs [ 97 ]	1
11010	Free sialic acid is believed to play a role in invasion by nontypeable H	1

11017	The @GENE$ response in vivo in mice is very important to protect mice from lethal infection with @DISEASE$	1
11018	Mice lac@GENE$ FNAR all succumbed within 6 days of infection , whereas 80 % of @DISEASE$ mice ( 6 - 8 - week - old ) survived the infection	1
11019	Interest@GENE$  , all IFNβ − / − mice survived the infection , demonstrati@GENE$ t the IFNαs can compensate @GENE$ oss of IFNβ in @DISEASE$	1
11020	Further@GENE$  IFNAR was shown to be a critical determinant of @DISEASE$@GENE$ as LGTV RNA was found in all organs in the@GENE$ ce of IFNAR , whereas in @DISEASE$ , only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [ 99 , 128 , 141 ]	1
11021	Using transgenic mice , it was furt@GENE$ shown that the IFN response was needed both in the peripheral tissue , as well as locally in the CNS , in order to clear @DISEASE$ [ 99 , 100 ] .	1
11022	The Gabriel Touré University Hospital is a 447 - bed tertiary - care general hospital located in Bamako	1
11023	It is a primary care hospital for people living in Bamako and a national reference centre for other patients	1
11024	Various medical and surgical specialities , including pediatrics , are located in the hospital	1
11025	The pediatrics department , with a capacity of 150 beds , includes a general pediatrics unit and a neonatal / emergency unit	1
11026	It receives sick children for primary care and severe cases referred from other healthcare settings	1
11027	On average , 50 , 000 consultations and 10 , 000 hospital admissions occur in the pediatrics department annually	1
11028	@DISEASE$ represent 34 % of admissions in children , and 15 % of child hospitalizations .	1
11029	T he first case of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ CoV ) in the Republic of Korea was confirmed in May 2015 after a traveller returned from the Middle East	1
11030	1 There were 186 cases , including 38 deaths , within two months	1
11031	1 The potential of a single @DISEASE$ - confirmed patient to result in such a large @DISEASE$ outbreak constitutes a serious global health concern	1
11032	2 During this @DISEASE$ outbreak , massive public health containment measures were enacted at various levels ; these included epidemiological investigations , isolation of suspected and confirmed cases , contact tracing and home quarantine of contacts	1
11033	Local public health centre ( LPHC ) and emergency medical services ( EMS ) personnel responded to the outbreak by conducting initial interviews with suspected cases , transporting patients and specimens and managing contacts	1
11034	Responders in contact with patients used different levels of personal protective equipment ( PPE )	1
11035	Full - protection PPE includes a gown , N95 respirator , gloves and goggles	1
11036	As the transmissibility of @DISEASE$ is unclear , 3 it is possible that responders were infected by being exposed to @DISEASE$ patients .	1
11037	Coronaviruses encode multiple proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral response	1
11038	58 - 60 MERS - CoV is no exception	1
11039	Several @GENE$ have been identified to be @GENE$ antagonists	1
11040	We , and others , have characterized at least three @GENE$ encoded by MERS - CoV	1
11041	In addition to the @GENE$ reported in this study , @GENE$ is a @GENE$ , which directly inhibits @GENE$ activation induced by dsRNA and / or the protein co - activator PACT	1
11042	24 , 25 In addition , our unpublished data also revealed that @GENE$ is a potent @GENE$ antagonist	1
11043	This is in line with findings by other groups although the mechanistic details of its action have not well documented	1
11044	22 , 23 One recent report suggested that @GENE$ might not only interact directly with @GENE$ in the cytoplasm but also perturb @GENE$ production in the nucleus through an as yet unknown mechanism	1
11045	61 Nevertheless , how @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and the other @GENE$ of MERS - CoV coordinate with each other to modulate the host innate antiviral response to facilitate viral replication and propagation remains elusive .	1
11046	Information on the incidence and clinical characteristics of severe @DISEASE$ resulting in intensive care treatment and / or fatal outcome is still limited in Germany , and post - pandemic data is thus far available only for the season 2010 / 11 [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
11047	Based on cases recorded by a nation - wide paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) reporting system , the pre - pandemic ( 2005 / 06 - 2007 / 08 ) , pandemic ( 2009 / 10 ) and post - pandemic ( 2010 / 11 ) annual incidence of severe @DISEASE$ cases per 100 , 000 children below 15 or 17 years of age was estimated as 0	1
11048	05 , 0	1
11049	8 - 1	1
11050	0 , and 0	1
11051	4 , respectively [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
11052	The data so far available indicated a shift towards younger children in A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 cases from the pandemic to the first post - pandemic season [ 20 ]	1
11053	In these studies , it remained unclear whether the higher pandemic and post - pandemic incidence in children was caused by higher @DISEASE$ activity , heightened physician awareness , more frequent or more sensitive influenza testing , or a more severe course of disease of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 [ 18 ]	1
11054	Furthermore , all these previous studies may have been affected by underreporting , as @DISEASE$ cases were reported at the discretion of the PICU physician without systematic screening for @DISEASE$ in patients with severe @DISEASE$ .	1
11055	A G1 - lineage H9N2 virus with oviduct tropism causes chronic pathological changes in the infundibulum and a long - lasting drop in egg production	1
11056	The data suggest for the first time that M	1
11057	rubra is another biological host for @DISEASE$ type - A and - B known from honeybees and that foodborne transmission is an underlying transmission mechanism	1
11058	Since ants are ubiquitous and important in terrestrial ecosystems , it appears as if there is a considerable potential for virus transmission between wild insects and managed bees with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning	1
11059	It has been suggested that viruses might offer novel options for the control of invasive ant species [ 37 ]	1
11060	However , we consider such biocontrol suboptimal due to the evident wide host range of viruses and the here demonstrated considerable chances of host - switches , with possibly dramatic consequences [ 5 ] .	1
11061	It is well known that the domestic house fly , Musca domestica spp	1
11062	, and some other fly species can transmit many kinds of pathogens mechanically [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]	1
11063	In particular , M	1
11064	domestica spp	1
11065	are the most important fly species at poultry farms [ 26 ] with regard to mechanical transmission of > 30 different pathogens [ 13 ] , for example , bacteria , protozoa , viruses , and parasite oocysts and eggs	1
11066	Some viruses can be transported to animals by contact with contaminated body surfaces of flies	1
11067	In the case of the house fly , it has been shown that @DISEASE$ can be mechanically transported by contaminated fly surfaces [ 21 ]	1
11068	House flies frequently defecate while feeding and resting on food surfaces [ 27 ]	1
11069	However , in studies of C	1
11070	nigribarbis , neither defecation nor vomiting was observed within 24 h after feeding ( data not shown )	1
11071	The body surface of the house fly could be contaminated by viruses easier than that of blow flies	1
11072	This would suggest that the mechanisms of virus transmission by blow flies could be different from those of house flies	1
11073	Therefore , to evaluate virus transmission mechanisms that are more complex than contact with a contaminated fly surface , blow fly intestinal organs , crop , and gut were analyzed for their possible role in transmission of @DISEASE$	1
11074	A seasonal consideration is that M	1
11075	domestica vicina populations are generally highest in the summer in Japan	1
11076	In fact , no house fly was found around any poultry farm or pigpen in Tamba Town during our survey in March	1
11077	Therefore , it seems reasonable that winter blow flies may be involved in transmission of winter pathogens , like @DISEASE$ virus , by maintaining minimum infectious titers .	1
11078	In this paper , epidemics refer to a spike , above normal , in the prevalence of a specific disease in a specific population ( Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 2012 )	1
11079	The literal definition of politics is the Bactivities that relate to influencing the actions and policies of a government or getting and keeping power in a government ^ ( Merriam - Webster 2016 )	1
11080	However , in the Bpolitics of epidemics ^ literature , politics often refers to the extensive and diverse influence of local , national , and international governments and organizations , on the health outcomes of communities during disease outbreaks	1
11081	For the purposes of this paper , politics will also refer to how scholars talked about epidemics , and whose narratives are reported in the reviewed literature .	1
11082	Research on bats in Western Asia is fragmented , both temporally and spatially	1
11083	Past research efforts have focused largely on cataloging the bat diversity in a single country [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] or adjacent countries in the region ( i	1
11084	e	1
11085	, Arabia [ 92 ] and Caucasus [ 93 ] )	1
11086	These initial efforts contributed some of the first information about bat systematics , ecology , behavior , and geographic distributions in Western Asia	1
11087	However , a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region , including new country records [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] and updated species ' distributions [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ]	1
11088	The growing number of new distributional records , as well as taxonomic revisions [ 102 , 103 ] and new species discoveries [ 96 , 104 ] , published within the last decade points to a clear need for continued bat diversity assessments and field research throughout the region .	1
11089	Conclusions : A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) using Microsoft Excel	1
11090	The @GENE$ software allowed automated , high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency ( range 3 to 52 Hz ) and avoids operator error due to selection bias	1
11091	We have included free access to the @GENE$ plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use .	1
11092	Fifty - six cats were screened to participate in the study	1
11093	Of the 56 cats , 4 did not meet the initial pre - diagnostic inclusion criteria	1
11094	On day 0 , 52 cats were randomized to 1 of the 2 study diets , of which 17 were found to either violate the inclusion or meet the exclusion criteria based on the results of the diagnostic screening	1
11095	Seven cats dropped out of the study prior to the day 28 visit	1
11096	Reasons for dropping out included unwillingness to eat the diet in four cats ( two cats fed Diet A and two cats fed Diet B ) , withdrawn by owner due to continued @DISEASE$ in two cats ( one fed Diet A for 1 day and one fed Diet B for 4 days ) , and one owner declined to participate following screening for one cat	1
11097	The final study population of 28 cats included 13 cats fed Diet A and 15 cats fed Diet B	1
11098	One of the cats in the Diet A group was inadvertently given the wrong diet after 2 weeks ; therefore , data for this cat were included for only the first 2 weeks of the feeding period .	1
11099	In addition to targeting HIV - 1 , @GENE$ - mediated protein delivery was further exploited to inhibit human papillomavirus type 18 ( HPV - 18 ) in cell culture [ 106 ]	1
11100	Mino et al	1
11101	delivered @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) into cultured cells by expressing @GENE$ in fusion with the 9R peptide	1
11102	These AZP @GENE$ conjugates strongly inhibited HPV - 18 replication to 3 % at 250 nM while gene - delivered AZP only achieved 12 % inhibition	1
11103	@GENE$ conjugates were also tested but proved to be less effective than @GENE$ fused to @GENE$ .	1
11104	There have been a few reports of PMO - mediated antiviral activity in animal models	1
11105	How PMOs could successfully suppress viral replication in vivo without the help of CPPS is not understood	1
11106	Warfield et al	1
11107	reported the nearly complete protection of rhesus macaques against @DISEASE$ using PMOs [ 88 ] .	1
11108	Specific anti - ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA	1
11109	At week 6 , @GENE$ were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV - prME ( Figure 4b )	1
11110	Endpoint titres were determined for each animal at week 2 ( after 1 immunisation ) and week 6 ( after 2 immunisations ; Figure 4c )	1
11111	The ELISA results were confirmed by western blot analysis using @DISEASE$ sera from the individual vaccinated animals ( Figure 4d )	1
11112	The neutralisation activity @GENE$ bodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluate@GENE$ a PRNT 50 assay	1
11113	All the vaccinated monkeys had significant neutralisation activity with anti - ZIKV reci@GENE$ l PRNT 50 dilution titres ranging from 161 to 1380 ( average 501 ± 224 standard error of the mean ; Figure @GENE$	1
11114	PRNT titres did not directly correlate with ELISA titre ( data not shown ) .	1
11115	The key issue at hand is to design statistical modeling and detection methods that can address these problems .	1
11116	Another characteristic feature of stimulatory ODN is their ability to enhance interactions between various immune cell populations by upregulation of @GENE$	1
11117	With the objective to test whether ODN 2216 could exert such properties in feline immune cells , the expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ was measured by flow cytometry in stimulated PBMCs of the same eight cats as above	1
11118	The expression of both @GENE$ was evaluated in gates defined to contain a PBMC population , a lymphocyte population and a non - lymphocyte population of cells	1
11119	The observed effects varied considerably between the cells of individual cats , ranging from no alterations to an increase of 400 % stained cells in some cellular subpopulations after ODN 2216 stimulation	1
11120	Also , in some animals , stimulation with the control ODN 2243 indicated similar staining patterns as PBS , whereas in other cats the induction of effects comparable to those of ODN 2216 could be observed	1
11121	The response of cells originating from a particular cat to stimulation with ODN 2243 did not however correlate with the influence of ODN 2216 on the expression of either surface molecule on these same cells	1
11122	Overall , an increased expression of both @GENE$ and @GENE$ was measured in gated PBMCs upon a 24 h stimulation with ODN 2216 when overlaid with the expression of these molecules after ODN 2243 or PBS stimulation ( Figure 1B and C )	1
11123	Considering all eight cats , lymphocytic cells expressed significantly higher levels of @GENE$ and @GENE$ when exposed to ODN 2216 than after treatment with PBS ( p = 0	1
11124	0195 and p = 0	1
11125	039 respectively , Figure 1D and F )	1
11126	Feline @GENE$ expression on lymphocytes also seemed to be affected by ODN 2216 and ODN 2243 in a similar manner ( Figure 1F )	1
11127	For nonlymphocytic cells , ODN 2216 more specifically affected the expression of @GENE$ molecules , inducing significant upregulation of surface levels of this molecule when compared to stimulation with ODN 2243 ( p = 0	1
11128	0391 ) and PBS ( p = 0	1
11129	0039 ) for 24 h ( Figure 1E )	1
11130	In contrast , the expression of @GENE$ was not significantly altered in cells gated as non - lymphocytes at this time point after stimulation ( Figure 1G )	1
11131	Finally , the cells of the three cats ( c08 , c09 and c12 ) that exhibited the highest proliferation rates in response to ODN 2216 ( Figure 1A ) also indicated the strongest increase in expression of both cell surface molecules in all cellular subpopulations tested .	1
11132	Direct and indirect methods have been applied to determine the chain - breaking antioxidant activity of natural products	1
11133	Direct methods are based on studying the effect of a tested product ( e	1
11134	g	1
11135	food ) containing antioxidants on the oxidative degradation of a testing system	1
11136	The substrate of oxidation may be individual lipids , lipid mixtures ( oils ) , proteins , DNA , blood plasma , LDL , and biological membranes	1
11137	Homogenous lipids or microheterogeneous systems ( micelles and liposomes ) can be used depending on the solubility of samples	1
11138	The indirect method studies the ability of antioxidant to scavenge some free radicals , which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation [ 29 ] .	1
11139	The experiments conducted both in vitro and in vivo in this study underline the feasibility of utilizing @GENE$ as a marker for induction of resistance to @DISEASE$ in the domestic cat	1
11140	Admittedly , both the supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with CpG - A and serum of treated cats contain a mixture of molecules that could play a role in the observed antiviral effects	1
11141	However , the viral inhibition in our in vitro assays was similar to that obtained after treatment of the cells with rfeIFNα@GENE$ hly correlated with the induction of Mx tran@GENE$ iption in the cell lines incubated with the supernatants	1
11142	After ODN 2216 injection in vivo , Mx expr@GENE$ ion in plasma also strongly correlated with its antiviral potential	1
11143	It is however important to note that Mx mRNA@GENE$ tein cannot be mechanistically linked to inhibition of the viruses tested	1
11144	Although the expression of other antiviral molecules such as 2 ' 5 '@GENE$  a@GENE$ he RNA - d@GENE$  w@GENE$ ot measured , their induction has been reported following CpG ODN@GENE$ mulation of PBMCs in other species [ 77 , 78 ] and differential interplay between several effector mechanisms most likely leads to the inhibition of individual viruses .	1
11145	@GENE$ are incorporated onto HIV - 1 virion particles and negatively imprint their infectivity	1
11146	As could be observed from the displays of the occurrence of @DISEASE$ in the study children [ 24 ] , the spatial - temporal distribution of these infections revealed more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several respiratory viral pathogens spreading between households in Bhaktapur .	1
11147	This is to our knowledge the largest epidemiological study in almost four decades of childhood @DISEASE$ in a developing country that identifies several common viruses	1
11148	We isolated at least one viral pathogen using PCR from 40 % of children during the 3 - year study period	1
11149	The literature reveals few studies based on sensitive molecular diagnosis from similar resource - poor settings	1
11150	Apart from recent studies on hMPV , most previous studies in developing countries have not used PCR for virus detection [ 1 ] .	1

11154	SNAD has a menu that controls output display interactively	1
11155	By default , output includes ID - to - name log in which selected information about generated names is detailed in table format that can be downloaded as an Excel file	1
11156	This table can be useful for controlling the name generation procedure and preparing legends to accompany an alignment or a phylogenetic tree in publication	1
11157	The user can also extract IDs from submitted alignment or tree by activating " names only " option , or retrieve annotation from cognate entries in table format	1
11158	In the current implementation of @GENE$ , the most time - consuming stage is data retrieval from databases	1
11159	For large queries and complex name formats , also using API , it is therefore advisable to start with less than 10 sequences to design a format to be used for the full query	1
11160	Queries containing up to 500 IDs and including sequence alignments up to 50000 characters can be processed through @GENE$ web page	1
11161	For queries containing more than 500 IDs , the user is advised to use one of the @GENE$ APIs .	1
11162	Nevertheless , the burden of disease in Finland is from the lower end on the European scale ( ranging from 1 % to 11 % ) , and only 3 % is estimated to be caused by dampness in comparison with average of 5 % in EU - 26 .	1
11163	Three levels of filtration were compared	1
11164	The baseline estimates assume that 90 % of the outdoor PM 2	1
11165	5 mass concentration penetrates indoors	1
11166	In addition , realistic but increasingly challenging penetration levels of 70 % and 50 % were evaluated	1
11167	These correspond to effective filtration of PM 2	1
11168	5 mass concentration by 27 % and 45 % , respectively , filtration levels that can be achieved in real buildings at least when using mechanical ventilation systems [ 13 ]	1
11169	When discussing the filtration efficiencies of filters and the above mentioned penetration efficiencies , it has to be noted that the - 11 - penetration efficiency is defined for the building , accounting for leaks and ventilation from windows , doors etc .	1
11170	The results indicate that for a fast - spreading disease such as @DISEASE$ , sampling a small proportion of the network is sufficient	1
11171	This relies on the assumption that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected	1
11172	This is not the case for all livestock diseases	1
11173	For example , animals infected with @DISEASE$ can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months [ 13 ] before becoming infectious	1
11174	The model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of this nature , and further work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow - spreading diseases such as @DISEASE$ , where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle .	1
11175	In the course of passaging CVB3 in the presence of DFMO , we observed two mutations changing from glutamine to positively charged lysine or arginine	1
11176	Interestingly , we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [ 31 ] , in which we observed a glycine - to - arginine mutation in @GENE$	1
11177	Given that polyamines are positively - charged at physiological pH , the emergence of positively - charged amino acids in polyamine - depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge	1
11178	The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the @GENE$ of either enzyme [ 27 , 38 ] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically	1
11179	Precisely how positively - charged amino acids or polyamines contribute to @GENE$ activity remains unknown .	1
11180	Cleistocalyx operculatus ( Roxb	1
11181	) Merr and Perry oil not only significantly inhibited LPS - induced secretion of @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , in RAW 264	1
11182	7 cells , as reported above , but also suppressed the mRNA expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ as well as blocked LPS - induced transcriptional activation of @GENE$ and nuclear translocation of @GENE$ [ 103 ] .	1
11183	In macrophages and other types of cells , LPS activates three subclasses of @GENE$ : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$	1
11184	Studies have revealed that some compounds are able to suppress @GENE$ and @GENE$ , to inhibit the @GENE$ and @GENE$ expression inhibiting some of these @GENE$ [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] .	1

11192	The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software	1
11193	Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and the means which were compared using the Tukey HSD at 5 % level of significance ( < 0	1

11195	The commonly seen cutaneous nodular form in FeL cases should be distinguished from nodules caused in cats with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and a wide variety of @DISEASE$ ( e	1

11199	Finally , @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ or due to immunemediated pathomecanisms , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ / mural Two years after a radical pinnectomy , the animal had lesion recurrence at the stump , and lesions later developed on the muzzle and nasal mucosa ; treatment was attempted several times , but with no resolution USA ( Texas ) 8 domestic cats ( 5 males and 3 females ) aged 1 to 11 years old ( median : 3 years )	1
11200	The most common serological test used appears to be the immunoflurescence antibody test ( IFAT )	1
11201	A validated cut off value of 1 : 80 has been recommended in cats tested by this serological technique and the serum antibody level to @GENE$ ranged from low to high positive levels in clinical cases of FeL [ 24 ]	1
11202	Quantitative enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) are also frequently employed and seems to be more sensitive than IFAT [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ]	1
11203	The direct agglutination test ( DAT ) was found less sensitive than IFAT [ 27 ] or ELISA [ 23 ] and western blot ( WB ) was more sensitive than IFAT [ 83 ] .	1
11204	Next , we assessed the cell cycle distribution after @DISEASE$ cells were infected with the currently circulating strains of EV - D68 at an MOI of 0	1
11205	8 for 24 h	1
11206	An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase was observed for both US / MO / 14 - 18947 ( 25	1
11207	83 % increase ; P < 0	1
11208	01 ) ( Figure 2C ) and US / KY / 14 - 18953 ( 10	1
11209	85 % increase ; P < 0	1
11210	01 ) ( Figure 2D )	1
11211	These strains also caused a corresponding increase in the ratio of cells in G0 / G1 - G2 / M ( 53	1
11212	54 % increase for US / MO / 14 - 18947 ; 85	1
11213	91 % increase US / KY / 14 - 18953 ; P < 0	1
11214	001 ; Figures 2C , D )	1
11215	Therefore , the currently circulating strains possess increased virulence and a similar ability as the Fermon strain to skew the cell cycle toward the G0 / G1 phase , which facilitates viral production .	1
11216	Given that G0 / G1 phase supports EV - D68 production , it would be advantageous for the virus to manipulate the host cell cycle to increase viral production	1
11217	Indeed , the EV - D68 Fermon strain displayed significant ability to increase the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase	1
11218	The EV - D68 Fermon strain was isolated in the United States in 1962 ( Schieble et al	1
11219	, 1967 ) , but currently circulating strains , including EV - D68 US / MO / 14 - 18947 and US / KY / 14 - 18953 , may be more relevant to current human health	1
11220	Therefore , we examined whether these two currently circulating strains had similar ability to manipulate the cell cycle	1
11221	Our results confirmed that the circulating EV - D68 strains manipulate the cell cycle in a similar manner as does the Fermon strain , though the current strains have higher virulence than Fermon	1
11222	Therefore , after more than 50 years ' evolution , EV - D68 still possesses the ability to arrest cells at G0 / G1 phase but EV - D68 virulence has increased .	1
11223	firstly by the lower indoor sources due to the source control and secondly by lower penetration of outdoor pollutants due to low level of ventilation .	1
11224	The rapid systemic appearance of @GENE$ expression suggested that a soluble factor such as @GENE$ , a known early responder to @DISEASE$ [ 22 ] and strong trigger of CD69 ex@GENE$ ion [ 17 , 19 , 20 ] , was inducing the response	1
11225	To determine whether the LDV - induced IFNa re@GENE$ e [ 16 ] could be responsible for CD69 in@GENE$ on , we first utilized the fact that IFNa in@GENE$  CD69 ex@GENE$ ion on B cells in vitro [ 19 ]	1
11226	Splenic B cells were isolated from naïve mice using CD19 + magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and cultured with 10 % plasma taken from mice infected 16 hours earlier with @DISEASE$	1
11227	B cells cultured for 4 hours with plasma from infected , but not uninfected mice , significantly upregulated C@GENE$ xpression ( Figure 2 )	1
11228	Furthermore , upregulation of C@GENE$ xpression was prevented by addition of a n@GENE$ pecific for I@GENE$  P@GENE$  in a concentrationdependent manner	1
11229	These findings suggested that the I@GENE$ esponse to @DISEASE$ infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well .	1
11230	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 37 ] and full @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) [ 38 , 39 ] were cloned from a blood sample taken from a patient ( # R6 ) with @DISEASE$ ( Text S1 )	1
11231	The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [ 40 ]	1
11232	R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1 - Cre trans@GENE$  ( purchased from Jackson Laboratory ) to produce R6CN2HCV - MxCr@GENE$ MxCre transgeni@GENE$  , which were designated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 )@GENE$ zCN5 - 15 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , respectively	1
11233	Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid - polycytidylic acid [ poly ( I : C ) ] ( GE Healthcare UK Ltd	1
11234	, Buckinghamshire , England ) ; 300 mL of a poly ( I : C ) solution ( 1 mg / mL in phosphate - buffered saline [ PBS ] ) was injected three times at 48 - h intervals	1
11235	All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care .	1
11236	Next , to determine which cell population ( s ) produced @GENE$ , @GENE$ , or both during continuous HCV expression in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , we isolated intrahepatic lymphocytes ( IHLs ) and labeled the macrophages ( the F4 / 80 + cells ) with @GENE$ and @GENE$ using an intracellular @GENE$ detection method	1
11237	Macrophages in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice produced small amounts of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , while those in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice produced much larger amounts of these @GENE$ ( Figure 6F ) .	1
11238	Modelling of @DISEASE$ is a rapidly growing field in which mathematical modellers can play a significant role in determining how applied knowledge can be translated into an understanding of dynamics at the population level [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]	1
11239	During the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) outbreak in the UK in 2001 , several research groups developed a range of models that were able to predict the spatio - temporal pattern of disease spread and the impact of control strategies [ 1 , 3 , 5 ]	1
11240	The use of these models in 2001 highlighted the role that models could play in shaping policy	1
11241	Since then , the infection data from the 2001 epidemic have enabled research to be carried out to predict optimal culling and vaccination strategies both for the 2001 epidemic itself and for any future @DISEASE$ epidemic in the UK and elsewhere [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .	1
11242	The distribution of @GENE$ in BALB / c lung tissue was detected with a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ )	1
11243	Briefly , sections were dewaxed , rehydrated , and subjected to 20 min of heatinduced epitope retrieval ( HIER ) ( pressure cooker ) in Tris buffered saline ( TBS ) / EDTA buffer , pH 9	1
11244	0 ( Vector Laboratories )	1
11245	After 15 min cooling at room temperature , sections were washed in TBS ( pH 7	1
11246	4 ) and incubated in @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( 2 mg / ml in 3 % fish skin gelatin in TBS ) overnight at 4 °	1
11247	Sections were then washed in TBS for 1 hr before incubating in Mouse on Mouse Polymer ( Abcam ) for 30 min , washed in TBS , and incubated with diaminobenzidine ( 0	1
11248	4 mg / ml , 3 min )	1
11249	Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin , blued with Scotts Tap Water Substitute , washed and dehydrated through graded alcohols to xylene , then coverslipped with Depex mounting medium	1
11250	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was detected with a @GENE$ ( Simga - Aldrich , clone Ac1 - 20	1
11251	4	1
11252	2 ) , or mouse isotype control at 5 mg / ml , with the same protocol as above but with HIER in citrate buffer with pH 6	1
11253	0 ( Vector Laboratories )	1
11254	The presence of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was detected in a similar fashion , using @GENE$ ( Sigma - Aldrich , clone 1A4 ) at 9 mg / ml , and detection as above , but without HIER	1
11255	Tissue was permeablized with 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min prior to the application of the @GENE$	1
11256	Digital images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope XT digital slide scanner ( Leica Technologies )	1
11257	Images are typically of the left lobe and right middle lobe of four mice .	1
11258	Colonization of the different sections of the oviduct was investigated comparing overall RRT - PCR positivity , TCID 50 values , virus loads and IHC scores	1
11259	The infundibulum resulted positive by RRT - PCR in a higher number of birds on days 4 and 6 pi ( Table 2 ) , while virus load ( Additional file 2 ) and TCID 50 values did not differ significantly among the oviduct sections .	1
11260	Histological analyses indicated a mild - to - moderate congestion of the spleens and lungs collected on day 4 , 6 and 10 pi , while the kidneys and brains appeared normal .	1
11261	Here , further work was performed and individual expression of @GENE$ was also capable of inducing autophagy , whereas @GENE$ and @GENE$ were not	1
11262	@GENE$ induced autophagosomes fused with @GENE$ labelled lysosomes and autophagosomes were susceptible to wortmannin treatment	1
11263	This indicates that bone fide autophagy was induced	1
11264	Interestingly , @GENE$ from SARS - CoV , MHV and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , also induced autophagy .	1
11265	Other studies on @DISEASE$ transmission among Egyptian rosette bats ( R	1
11266	aegyptiacus ) showed that bats naturally infected by other experimentally inoculated bats , seem to have a prolonged incubation period [ 42 , 43 ]	1
11267	Furthermore , the infected bats remained viremic and shed infectious virus for up to three weeks , after which there was no detectable virus in blood , oral swabs and urine samples	1
11268	Despite the lack of detectable virus , even four months after initial infection , experimentally inoculated bats were able to transmit the virus to other contact bats [ 43 ]	1
11269	One of the ways in which this can be explained is that @DISEASE$ persisted in the bats ( probably in the spleen [ 42 ] ) , and a decrease in antibody levels led to increase in viral load which could then be shed to infect other bats / animals	1
11270	A bat coronavirus was also shown to persistently infect North American little brown bats ( Myotis lucifugus ) [ 44 ]	1
11271	Little brown bats in captivity were able to harbor the coronavirus in their intestines and lungs during hibernation for a period of four months	1
11272	In addition , there was no significant pathology seen in the bat tissues .	1

11282	Since the goal is to predict the number of chest radiographs , for each city we fit a linear time series regression model , using the number of chest radiographs as the response , and the number of visits and temperature as predictor variables	1
11283	We smooth the temperature series , because we believe that long - range temporal trends are more predictive of chest radiograph counts	1

11287	Analyses of the prevalence , length , and thickness of myocardial extensions has resulted in conflicting reports as to whether various parameters do ( Hassink et al	1
11288	2003 ; Kholová and Kautzner 2003 ) or do not ( Kholová and Kautzner 2004 ; Saito et al	1
11289	2000 ) correlate with @DISEASE$	1
11290	However , mutations in genes encoding the transcription factors Nkx2 - 5 (@GENE$  al	1

11293	2014 ; Wang et al	1
11294	2014 ) , and GATA6 ) ar@GENE$ associated with @DISEASE$ ; these genes are known to be required for cardiovascular development	1
11295	These data suggest that perturbation of the transcriptional program associated with cardiac muscle ( but not necessarily disrupting morphology ) may underlie the association of the pulmonary myocardium with @DISEASE$	1
11296	Consistent with this , both PITX2C and NKX2 - 5 are requir@GENE$ irec@GENE$ ntain the identity of the pulmonary myocardium ( Mommersteeg et al	1
11297	2007 )	1
11298	Lost or reduced expression of NKX2 - 5 causes pulmonary myoc@GENE$ lls to adopt a pacemaker - like phenotype similar to cells of the sinus horn myocardium , without altering cellular morphology ( Mommersteeg et al	1
11299	2007 ; Ye et al	1
11300	2015 )	1
11301	This implies that healthy pulmonary myocardium could gain pacemaker function from which an ectopic beat might originate via a shift in the gene expression program away from that of working myocardium and toward a pacemaker program	1
11302	Thus , molecular analysis of pulmonary myocardium cells in vivo is warranted and could provide a powerful tool for understanding the pathobiology of @DISEASE$ and identifying novel therapeutic targets	1
11303	This led us to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms that might drive the expression of cardiac genes in this tissue .@GENE$ 	1
11304	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) due to Escherichia coli is an economically important disease in pig production worldwide , affecting pigs during the first 2 weeks after weaning and characterized by @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ in surviving piglets [ 1 , 2 ]	1
11305	Furthermore , many stress factors associated with the weaning period , such as removal from the sow , dietary changes , adapting to a new environment , mixing of pigs from different farms and histological changes in the small intestine , may negatively affect the response of immune system and lead to an @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
11306	@DISEASE$ is usually associated with proliferation of enterotoxigenic E	1
11307	coli ( ETEC ) [ 2 , 6 ]	1
11308	This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins , both essential for disea@GENE$ t [ @GENE$  predominant adhesins in @DISEASE$ being F4 and F18 [ 6 , 8 ]	1
11309	S@GENE$ stinal adhesi@GENE$ and @GENE$ equent colonization by ETEC in pigs is mediated by F4 or F18 specific receptors , the existence and function of thes@GENE$ s being crucial to determine the susceptibility of pigs to @DISEASE$ [ 7 ]	1
11310	The predominant serogroup of ETEC associated with @DISEASE$ in pigs worldwide is O149 , commonly in the combination O149 : LT : STa : STb : EAST1 : F4ac [ 2 ]	1
11311	Colistin , a polymyxin antibiotic@GENE$ uced by Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus [ 9 ] , is widely used for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 10 ]	1
11312	However , in humans this antibiotic is now considered as the last therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug - resistant Gram - negative bacteria ( MDR - GNB ) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species [ 11 , 12 ] .	1
11313	The viral titers were determined by measuring the 50 % tissue culture infective dose ( TCID50 ) in a microtitration assay using @DISEASE$ cells , as described ( Gay et al	1
11314	, 2006 )	1
11315	RD cells were seeded and incubated at 37 • C for 24 h in 96 - well plates	1
11316	Viruscontaining supernatant was serially diluted 10 - fold , and 100 µl of diluent virus was added per well in octuplicate	1
11317	Until the experimental endpoint was reached the cytopathic effect was observed once per day	1
11318	According to the Reed - Muench method ( Reed , 1983 ) the viral titers of the TCID50 were determined , based on the assumption that material with 1 × 10 5 TCID50 / ml will produce 0	1

11323	In this study , we investigated the synthesis and delivery of the @GENE$ as a privileged antigen by a MVA vector virus	1
11324	The recombinant MVA expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full - length @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) proved genetically stable and fully replication - competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts , an established cell substrate for MVA vaccine manufacturing	1
11325	Upon in vitro infection , @GENE$ produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with @GENE$	1
11326	Furthermore , @GENE$ was tested as an experimental vaccine in BALB / c mice and elicited MERS - CoV N - specific interferon γ ( IFN - γ ) - producing CD8 + T cells	1
11327	Using peptide library covering the whole @GENE$ polypeptide , we identified new @GENE$ d restricted peptide epitopes of @GENE$ in BALB / c mice	1
11328	This data will be highly relevant for further assessment of N antigen - specific immune responses in the well - established MERS - CoV - BALB / c mouse immunization / challenge model [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] .	1
11329	After informed consent was obtained , demographic and domestic animal exposure data were collected using a structured questionnaire	1
11330	Blood samples were then collected and transported on wet ice to the KSA Ministry of Health ( MoH ) laboratory in the Jazan region , KSA	1
11331	Aliquots of sera were shipped to the University of Florida for serological assessment .	1
11332	The BLAST ( Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ) menu offers the user to search the database using a protein sequence as query against the reviewed set of @GENE$ from UniProt database	1
11333	We have used Position - Specific Iterative ( PSI ) BLAST to search against the database	1
11334	65 This search can be run against any of the viral classification systems described above	1
11335	By default , the BLAST search runs against all the data available in the database with a default e - value 0	1
11336	01 ; nevertheless , the user has the possibility to run the BLAST search against a specific category ( Baltimore classification ) or Order taxonomic rank ( ICTV classification ) , and define a different e - value	1
11337	The results page displays the subject sequences from the database that match the query sequence	1
11338	The @GENE$ are highlighted with red asterisks	1
11339	The menus ' Bibliography ' and ' Help ' provide users with additional information	1
11340	Finally , the ' Links ' menu gives access to other @GENE$ , inducing the iLIR search tool and the @GENE$ for eukaryote model organisms	1
11341	27 , 28 Analysis of the content of the database	1
11342	None of the three shelters in Mildura vaccinated cats	1
11343	Of the three shelters in Melbourne , one did not vaccinate cats , while two vaccinated cats on admission , one using an inactivated vaccine and the other an MLV vaccine	1
11344	All shelters that used vaccinations gave a primary course to kittens starting at a minimum age of 6 weeks , then every 3 to 4 weeks , finishing at 12 to 14 weeks of age , while adult cats were given two vaccinations one month apart	1
11345	Both rescue societies , one in NSW and one in Victoria , accepted unvaccinated cats and kittens for adoption from municipal pounds ( shelters ) , that were fostered until adoption	1
11346	For 177 shelter - housed cats , the median time from admission to diagnosis of @DISEASE$ was 9 days ( IQR 0 - 17 ; range 0 - 61 days ) .	1
11347	To determine whether microglia depletion impacts innate immune mechanisms of virologic control specifically within the CNS , mice were fed control or PLX5622 - embedded chow for 2 weeks , then i	1
11348	c	1
11349	infected with an attenuated strain of WNV ( WNV - NS5 - E218A ) at 10 4 PFU	1
11350	The @GENE$ point mutation abolishes @GENE$ activity , which functions to methylate the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and facilitate escape of @GENE$ with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) - mediated suppression ; thus , this attenuation limits viral replication by increasing sensitivity of the virus to @GENE$ - mediated innate immune mechanisms [ 45 , 49 ]	1
11351	Despite this attenuation , mice treated with PLX5622 were significantly more susceptible to lethal @DISEASE$ infection than those receiving control chow ( Fig	1
11352	3a )	1
11353	@DISEASE$ was also significantly increased in PLX5622 - treated mice ( Fig	1
11354	3b )	1
11355	Consistent with this , viral titers measured by plaque assay at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 dpi in the olfactory bulb ( Fig	1
11356	3d ) , cortex ( Fig	1
11357	3e ) , cerebellum ( Fig	1
11358	3f ) , brainstem ( Fig	1
11359	3g ) , and spinal cord ( Fig	1
11360	3h ) were significantly higher in PLX5622 - treated compared in control - treated mice infected with WNV - NS5 - E218A	1
11361	As virus was inoculated into the cortex , it was detected there at 2 dpi , followed by spread to the olfactory bulb by 4 dpi , and cerebellum , brainstem , and spinal cord by 6 dpi	1
11362	PLX5622 treatment also led to decreased proinflamm@GENE$  in the cortex at 8 dpi ( Fig	1
11363	3c ) and increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 6 dpi ( Fig	1
11364	3l - p ) after i	1
11365	c	1
11366	infection with WNV - NS5 - E218A .	1
11367	Other similar studies pointed out that viral loads in serum returned to pretransplant levels within 24 to 48 hours after the procedure	1
11368	Within weeks after transplant , viral loads would be approximately 1 log higher than pretransplant levels [ 4 , 15 ]	1
11369	However , studies investigating the impact of pretransplant viral load on the likelihood of @DISEASE$ recurrence have produced controversial results	1
11370	Several reports indicated that pretransplant viral load did not correlate with either the likelihood or timing of @DISEASE$ recurrence following LT [ 16 ]	1
11371	By contrast , one study including 166 @DISEASE$ - infected recipients demonstrated that before transplant , HCV viral load greater than 1 million viral equivalents / mL was associated with decreased graft and patient survival [ 17 ]	1
11372	Given the hypothesis that pretransplant treatment of HCV will reduce or prevent @DISEASE$ posttransplant recurrence , it has been advocated that patients with @DISEASE$ on the transplant list should be considered for therapy with the goal of obtaining sustained virological response ( SVR ) prior to LT [ 18 ] .	1
11373	To examine the viral load of EV71 in the tissues of mice while treated with N3 , we isolated RNA from the different organs from 5746 - infected mice on Day 6 post infection and then quantified EV71 transcripts using real - time RT - PCR	1
11374	We noticed that administration of N3 reduced viral expression significantly in the brain , spinal cord , muscle , skin , and the intestine ( Fig	1
11375	6 )	1
11376	We also confirmed that CNS - and limb muscle - tropism of EV71 viremia occurred in this model [ 11 ] .	1
11377	T cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved @GENE$	1
11378	However , information on MERS - CoV N antigen - specific T cell specificities is still limited	1
11379	Thus , we aimed first to identify @GENE$ polypeptide - specific T cell epitopes in BALB / c mice immunized twice with recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N or non - recombinant MVA as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes	1
11380	Eight days after the final immunization , splenocytes were prepared and the purified CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the @GENE$	1
11381	Overlapping peptides were pooled using a two - dimensional , pooled - peptide matrix system ( Table S1 ) and screened by @GENE$ ELISPOT	1
11382	The stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA - MERS - N immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of IFN - γ producing T cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or MVA - control vaccinated animals	1
11383	Stimulation with the peptides from pools H8 ( n = 10 ) and V8 ( n = 10 ) as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide F2L [ 49 ] ( data not shown ) showed elevated numbers of IFN - γ spot forming cells ( SFC ) in CD8 + T cell cultures ( Figure 3a , b )	1
11384	MVA - MERS - N immunizations given by i	1
11385	p	1
11386	and i	1
11387	m	1
11388	routes resulted in comparable T cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping N - specific peptides from pools V8 and H8	1
11389	In contrast , peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities , as exemplified for peptides in pools V4 and V6 .	1
11390	Much has been learned from the unexpected arrival of @DISEASE$ in the spring of 2003 [ 26 , 27 ]	1
11391	Likewise , we continue to learn from historical analyses of the 1918 @DISEASE$ pandemic , with one recent study providing strong support for the hypothesis that early implementation of public health measures such as quarantine can significantly reduce @DISEASE$ transmission [ 9 ]	1
11392	Given the current threat posed by @DISEASE$ , it is incumbent upon the public health community - including ethicists and legal experts - to delineate both the limits to individual liberty and the obligations of public health authorities in the context of an @DISEASE$ outbreak	1
11393	It is noteworthy that the concept of ' voluntary quarantine ' features prominently in many of the current plans for @DISEASE$	1
11394	As contrasted with the classic quarantine order , which is typically enforceable by law , voluntary household quarantine refers to compliance based on the individual ' s own free will without legal compulsion .	1

11397	Initial T cell activation of both virus - and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells occurs within CLN ( 13 , 29 ) , consistent with anatomical linkage between deep CLN and CNS by the meningeal lymphatic system ( 30 )	1
11398	Transfer of Foxp3 + @GENE$ during @DISEASE$ limited @DISEASE$ damage by inhibiting T cell proliferation within CLN and reducing overall T cell numbers within the CNS , yet without affecting frequencies of virus - specific T cells ( 20 )	1
11399	These studies predicted that Foxp3 + Treg@GENE$ ti@GENE$ ring @DISEASE$ would increase T cell numbers in CLN and CNS	1
11400	DT - treated DTR + mice indeed exhibited a threefold increase in CLN cellularity compared to DTR − controls between days 21 and 28 p	1
11401	i	1
11402	( Figure 2A )	1
11403	However , overall CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proportions were not altered suggesting the cellular increase was not lymphocyte specific ( Figure 2B )	1
11404	Analysis of T cell activation following Treg depletion revealed a@GENE$ ificant increase in CD62L low CD44 hi populat@GENE$ n both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subset ( Figure 2C )	1
11405	Contrasting increased activation in CLN , DTR − and DTR + mice showed no difference in total numbers of splenocytes 1 week after DT treatment ( data not shown ) , suggesting specific regulation in CLN .	1
11406	The antioxidant activity of essential oils is another biological property of great interest because they may preserve foods from the toxic effects of oxidants [ 15 ]	1
11407	Moreover , essential oils being also able of scavenging free radicals may play an important role in some disease prevention such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
11408	Increasing evidence has suggested that these diseases may result from cellular damage caused by free radicals [ 16 , 17 ] .	1
11409	A similar questionnaire and case definition had been used in previous studies on @DISEASE$ - related PICU admission [ 18 , 19 ]	1
11410	Key variables were extracted from these publications for comparison purposes	1
11411	Data from Streng et al	1
11412	[ 18 ] and the present study were pooled for statistical comparison of pre - and post - pandemic seasons .	1
11413	We sought to identify common viral pathogens in @DISEASE$ in a large number of Nepalese children 2 to 35 months of age visiting a field clinic	1
11414	We also wished to describe the seasonal pattern of @DISEASE$ over a 3 - year period and explore possible associations with available meteorological data .	1
11415	Respiratory viruses were detected in 7 of 32 ( 21	1
11416	9 % ) cases , with predominance of @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) ( Table 2 )	1
11417	In 3 of 32 ( 9	1
11418	4 % ) cases the respiratory virus was the sole pathogen detected ( Table 2 )	1
11419	@DISEASE$ was detected in 1 of 19 cases , in a mixed infection with H	1
11420	influenzae ( Table 2 ) .	1
11421	Recent occurrences of pandemics like the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) or @DISEASE$ clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases	1
11422	The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region	1
11423	Therefore , pandemic control is of highest importance to human health	1
11424	Unfortunately , the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift	1
11425	For example , the human @DISEASE$ pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted @DISEASE$ viruses [ 1 ]	1
11426	Moreover , the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived " permissible host "	1
11427	In particular , the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin ( HA ) gene@GENE$ g / 1 / 96 H5N1 and A / teal / Hong Kong / W312 / 97 H6N1 , while the internal genes were received from A / quail / Hong Kong / G1 / 97 H2N2 or A / teal / Hong Kong / W312 / 97 H6N1 , respectively [ 2 ] , [ 3 ]	1
11428	Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken , its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds	1
11429	This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level ( within the group of viruses ) and micro level ( within the group of strains ) using comparative phyloinformatics	1
11430	This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial , temporal , and host dimensions , and therefore , allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis	1
11431	However , corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved	1
11432	Therefore , it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time	1
11433	Furthermore , these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist - friendly	1
11434	As a result , effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time , since specific local strains can be targeted directly .	1
11435	When a Fe 3 + - TPTZ ( 2 , 4 , 6 - tripyridyl - s - triazine ) complex is reduced to the Fe 2 + form by an antioxidant under acidic conditions , an intense blue color develops with an absorption maximum at 593 nm	1
11436	The antioxidant effect ( reducing ability ) can be evaluated by monitoring the formation of a @GENE$ complex with a spectrophotometer [ 59 ] .	1
11437	To further confirm that @GENE$ is a negative regulator of @GENE$ pathway , Hsu cells were transfected with a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) containing a @GENE$ under @GENE$ , along with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
11438	After 24 h , cells were infected with WNV and @GENE$ activity was measured 16 hpi	1

11471	The capacity of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts or from the fruits of Foeniculum vulgare for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was always less than 50 % , at the concentrations assayed ( 100 - 2 , 000 mg / mL ) [ 57 ]	1
11472	Mannitol , the reference used in this assay , showed a similar scavenging percentage at ≈ 2 , 000 mg / mL	1
11473	Only higher concentrations presented percentages > 50 % .	1
11474	In pigs , the most frequently found @GENE$ of ETEC are K88 ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ [ 40 ]	1
11475	F4 - positive and F18 ETEC ( ETEC : F4 and ETEC : F18 ) strains represent the major cause of @DISEASE$ in p@GENE$ 	1

11477	Thus , attachment of ETEC to the pig intestinal mucosa is a crucial step in the pathogenesis and the initiation of @DISEASE$	1
11478	Two ant@GENE$ ts of F1@GENE$ ri@GENE$ ist : @GENE$ ( F107 ) and F18ac ( @GENE$ and 8813 )	1
11479	F18ac is commonly associated with ETEC cau@GENE$ DISEASE$ , whereas F18ab is often involved in @DISEASE$ [ 52 ]	1
11480	No cross@GENE$ ctio@GENE$ een F18ab and F18ac was observed on vaccination against F18 @GENE$ nonfimbrial ad@GENE$  i@GENE$ d as AIDA ( adhesin involved in diffuse adherence ) has been observed to be associated with ETEC strains recovered from pigs with @DISEASE$ [ 54 ]	1
11481	In this study , 50	1
11482	0 % of isolates were ETEC - aidA +	1
11483	Moreover , it has been demonstrat@GENE$ at the expression of AIDA by a @DISEASE$ E	1
11484	coli strain ( AIDA - I + , STb + ) was essential for pig ' s intestinal colonization and for in vitro bacterial autoaggregation and biofilm formation [ 55 ] .	1
11485	In general , mutations in the @GENE$ could result either from selection for de novo mutations that occurred during host infection , or enrichment of sub - consensus variants that originated from the transmitting host	1
11486	Since it is difficult to determine de novo mutations without complete sampling of an outbreak , we focused on those consensus mutations that 1 ) showed inversion between the historical and outbreak samples and 2 ) led to changes in the amino acids	1
11487	Historical samples were defined as those collected between 1995 and 2000	1
11488	Eleven @GENE$ were found to have such amino acid inversions , their frequency distributions for the historical and outbreak haplotypes are shown in Figure 5 A and B respectively	1
11489	Although the frequencies of these two haplotypes sum up to 100 % at a given loci in all samples ( except for outlier entries colored white indicating no data and black indicating absence of these two haplotypes and presence of a third haplotype ) , the dominant haplotype tended to be near 100 % ( values below 100 % have a median of 99	1
11490	86 % ) and the minor variant had extremely low presence ( median 0	1
11491	15 % , therefore could not be visualized if only one @GENE$ was presented )	1
11492	The outbreak haplotypes ( shown in black letters at the bottom of the heatmaps ) began as low frequency variants ( 0	1
11493	04 % to 6	1
11494	03 % ) in the historical samples and rose sometime between 2003 and 2009 to become the dominant haplotypes ( 94 % - 100 % ) in most of the outbreak samples ( Fig	1
11495	5B ) ; while the @GENE$ ( shown in red letters in the heatmaps ) went from being dominant ( 98 % - 100 % presence ) in the historical samples to low level variants ( 0	1
11496	05 % - 1	1
11497	95 % ) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples ( Fig	1
11498	5A )	1
11499	These data highlight the dynamic evolution of the @GENE$ me over time .	1
11500	In conclusion , S	1
11501	suis is an important and emerging public health issue in Asia and one with the potential for both endemic transmission and for explosive epidemics	1
11502	We identified risk factors for @DISEASE$ infection which can be addressed in health education programs targeted at individuals and communities at risk , focusing on skin protection for those in direct contact with pigs or pork and avoiding eating raw or under - cooked pig products	1
11503	( 1 ) Number positive / total number tested ( each person had 2 samples taken on 2 separate occasions with a minimum of 10 - 14 days in between ) .	1
11504	We collected 1162 throat and rectal swab samples from the 303 hospital controls and 4492 throat and rectal swab samples from healthy persons , including 300 community controls and 920 household members of cases , hospital controls and community controls	1
11505	In none of these samples was S	1

11507	( Table 7 ) .	1
11508	DEPs with similar quantitative changes were clustered by hierarchical clustering and analysed by gene ontology enrichment , revealing that 12 h and 60 h post - infection were the optimal times to analyse the autonomous parvovirus replication and apoptosis processes , respectively	1
11509	Using the Metacore TM database , 29 @GENE$ were enriched in a network involved in @GENE$ regulation	1
11510	Besides , a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV - induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the @DISEASE$ caused by @DISE@GENE$	1

11512	A Matchmaker two - hybrid system ( catalog no	1
11513	630489 ; Clontech ) was used to screen @GENE$ that interact with @GENE$	1
11514	Briefly , the bait construct @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was transformed into the yeast strain Y2HGold and hybridized with a @GENE$ derived from porcine macrophages [ 39 ]	1
11515	Transformants were selected for growth on synthetically defined ( SD ) medium lacking His , Leu , Trp and Ade ( SD / - 4 ) for 3 to 6 days at 30 [UNK] C	1
11516	The clones were then transferred to SD / - 4 medium containing 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - α - D - galactopyranoside ( X - α - Gal ) and aureobasidin A ( Aba ) ( SD / - 4 / X - α - Gal / Aba )	1
11517	Blue colonies were selected and inoculated with 5 mL of SD / - 4 medium for shaking culture at 30 [UNK] C for 1 to 3 days	1
11518	@GENE$ were extracted using a @GENE$ ( catalog no	1
11519	D3376 ; Omega , Guangzhou , China ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and the target inserts were verified by sequencing using the Gal4 AD and 3 1 AD primers	1
11520	To validate the interaction between @GENE$ and the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ were cotransformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain using a yeast transformation system 2 ( catalog no	1
11521	630439 ; Clontech )	1
11522	The interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ was used as a positive control , and the @GENE$ , which does not interact with the @GENE$ , was included as a negative control .	1
11523	To construct a stable cell line overexpressing @GENE$ , the @GENE$ was subcloned into the lentivirus vector @GENE$ ( Addgene , Cambridge , MA , USA )	1
11524	HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the recombinant plasmid @GENE$ or the empty vector @GENE$ , and the packaging plasmids @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
11525	At 6 hpt , the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5 % FBS	1
11526	After 48 - h incubation , the supernatant of the cell culture was harvested and ultra - centrifuged to concentrate the recombinant lentiviruses	1
11527	Subsequently , PK - 15 cells grown on 6 - well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses of 10 transduction units ( TU ) per cell	1
11528	The expression of @GENE$ in the transduced PK - 15 cells was examined by Western blotting using a @GENE$ ( 1 : 2000 ) ( catalog no	1

11555	These results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells .	1
11556	The single gene knockout analysis rapidly simulates the individual knockout of every gene represented in the model during growth in the input conditions	1

11559	Increasing antibiotic resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics makes @DISEASE$ a major threat to public health worldwide	1
11560	As we have described in result section , our in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns were concerning in the sense that most of the isolates except S	1
11561	pneumaniae , such as K	1
11562	pneumaniae , Streptococcus species , H	1
11563	influenzae , and E	1
11564	agglomerans exhibited alarming levels of resistance against the majority of available first line of antibiotics	1
11565	Even two of 15 multidrug - resistant isolates ( K	1
11566	pneumaniae and E	1
11567	agglomerans ) displayed resistance not only against all the first - line of antibiotics but also against all the second - line of antibiotics	1
11568	Despite the advances in therapeutic and preventive measures , the emerging resistance to the antibiotics is a growing concern among clinicians and other health professionals worldwide	1
11569	The indiscriminate and unreasonable use of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of resistance , which may turn out to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing countries	1
11570	A tailored antibiotic treatment is in demand to tackle this major issue , but the dearth of information regarding the etiological agents and antibiotic sensitivity patterns in countries like Bangladesh have made it difficult	1
11571	The information regarding antibiotic resistance patterns provided here in this study is expected to raise alertness among physicians , community people , as well as among policy makers of public and private sectors in the country .	1

11574	Might pandemics be shortened by artificially accelerating the rate of genetic attenuation ? The continuous and linear accumulation of mutations within a single influenza lineage , as was seen in H1N1 during the 2009 - 2010 influenza season ( in which about 0	1
11575	3 % of all nucleotides mutated ) , supports the concept that natural genetic attenuation may be an important factor in the natural cessation of @DISEASE$ pandemics	1
11576	Thus , the possibility of an artificial acceleration of mutation rate deserves further investigation , and may suggest new avenues of research in terms of pandemic management [ 13 ]	1
11577	It is clear that natural selection is strongly at work in the @GENE$	1
11578	This can be seen by preservation of all the @GENE$ and functions of the virus , in spite of the fact that every possible point mutation happens in every human individual during the course of an infection	1
11579	A large fraction of all deleterious mutations clearly must be selected away	1
11580	Likewise , the emergence of major antigenic variants shows that positive selection is operational	1
11581	It is also clear that genetic drift is strongly in operation , with a major viral bottleneck happening at each transmission from one human host to the next , and perhaps at the start of each local outbreak [ 33 ] , ensuring that most unique genotypes are very quickly lost	1
11582	Yet , in addition to selection and drift , it also appears there is very strong mutational pressure on the @GENE$ , potentially leading to lethal mutagenesis in most strains , and a gradual , natural genetic attenuation of human @DISEASE$ in general .	1

11585	Nurses play a major role in caring for patients infected with different @DISEASE$	1
11586	Nurses in high @DISEASE$ burden settings are at higher risk of developing @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) when compared to the general population , due to their exposure to the large number of @DISEASE$ positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [ 3 ]	1
11587	Working in a high - risk @DISEASE$ setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare , especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed	1
11588	Health Care Workers ( HCWs ) , especially nurses , have higher rates of @DISEASE$ than the general population due to persistent occupational @DISEASE$ exposure , particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed @DISEASE$ in healthcare facilities and @DISEASE$ infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [ 4 ] .	1
11589	Recombination is a well - known feature of adenovirus genetics [ 28 , 29 ]	1
11590	It typically occurs only between strains of the same species [ 29 ] ; interspecies recombinants are uncommon [ 20 ]	1
11591	It is noteworthy that we found a peculiar HAdV - 2 / 6 cluster in the present study , likely the recombinants of HAdV - 2 and HAdV - 6	1
11592	We have amplified the full @GENE$ from one of HAdV - 2 / 6 recombinants ( GenBank accession No	1
11593	KP696777 )	1
11594	Its position on the phylogenetic tree indicated that the intertypic ( HAdV - 2 / 6 ) recombination occurred in the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ ( data not shown )	1
11595	However , confirmation of this event requires the sequencing of the complete genome .	1
11596	Numerous epidemiologic studies describe synergistic and antagonistic relationships among various commensal bacteria [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] and , although the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear , in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest potential mechanisms involve either direct interaction between bacterial species or indirect interactions via the host immune system ( Table 1 )	1
11597	A number of population studies suggest that S	1
11598	pneumoniae carriage is positively associated with @DISEASE$	1
11599	influenzae [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] and Moraxella catarrhalis [ 18 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] carriage but negatively associated with S	1
11600	aureus [ 19 , 20 , [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ]	1
11601	Furthermore , S	1
11602	aureus carriage is generally negatively associated with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
11603	catarrhalis [ 19 , 24 , 31 ] carriage , whereas H	1
11604	influenzae and M	1
11605	catarrhalis are believed to be positively associated [ 18 , 22 , 24 , 33 ]	1
11606	Nevertheless , our understanding is limited , as the dynamics of niche competition likely consist of complex relationships between multiple species [ 31 , 34 ] and strains [ 15 , 35 ] , further influenced by host and environmental factors [ 22 , 36 ]	1
11607	As carriage is an important precursor of @DISEASE$ for certain bacterial species [ 12 ] , unraveling the complex system of bacterial interactions that determine URT microbiota may be key factor for understanding the etiology of @DISEASE$ .	1
11608	To measure the stability of the mutations , Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0	1
11609	1 with all of the viral mutants for 24 h	1
11610	The virus was then passed to new cells by transferring 50 µL supernatant	1
11611	After five passages , RNA was extracted and purified from supernatants and reverse transcribed	1
11612	Sanger sequencing was used to determine whether mutations were stable over the passages by looking at the chromatograms and determining the presence or absence of the mutant nucleotide	1
11613	Fitness assays were similarly performed , but Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0	1
11614	1 with an equal combination of wild - type and mutant CVB3 and passaged five times	1
11615	Fitness was determined via Sanger sequencing and analysis of the chromatogram to determine if the wild - type or mutant nucleotide was present in the sample .	1
11616	To further support the argument that @GENE$ affect the infectivity of newly produced viral particles under endogenous conditions , we silenced @GENE$ from virus - producing cells and given that each @GENE$ exerts an antiviral effect , the three of them were targeted simultaneously	1
11617	We first used HeLaP4 cells that express @GENE$ at steady state	1
11618	HeLa cells were challenged with @GENE$ specific for the 3 @GENE$ or control @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and shortly selected with puromycin	1
11619	Then , cells were challenged with replication competent HIV - 1 ( @GENE$ at an MOI 1 ) to obtain a consistent amount of virus - producing cells	1
11620	After extensive cell washing and @GENE$ treatment to remove non internalized virus , cells were re - seeded and two days after , cells were lysed and newly produced viral particles were purified , normalized by exo - RT and used for a WB analysis , as well as to challenge target cells ( Figure 5A )	1
11621	As expected , downregulation of the intracellular levels of @GENE$ led to viruses that incorporated less @GENE$	1
11622	When the infectivity of exo - RT normalized viral particles produced from control versus IFITM knockdown cells was assessed , the formers displayed a statistically significant increase in infectivity ( two fold ) .	1
11623	N - term @GENE$ were obtained from Dr	1
11624	Guo ( Drexel University , Doylestown , USA )	1
11625	The following DNA expression constructs have been described before : Gag - Pol + @GENE$ and corresponding @GENE$ coding @GENE$ that yield single - cycle infection - competent viruses derived from different retroviruses [ 38 ] ; replicationcompetent HIV - 1 proviral clones ( X4 - or R5 - tropic , NL4 - 3 and ADA , respectively ) ; VSVg and HIV - 1 envelopes ; the Vpr - Blam and @GENE$ [ 32 , 44 ] ; GALV and RD - TR [ 29 ]	1
11626	For WB and immuno - gold analyses , the following antibodies were used : @GENE$ ( Sigma ) , @GENE$ ( F7425 , Sigma ) , @GENE$ ( clone 183 - H5C from the AIDS Reagents Program of the NIH ) , @GENE$ ( for WB : # ab21179 , @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( # @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , respectively , @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( Becton Dickinson )	1
11627	@GENE$ ( Eurobio ) was used at a final concentration of 1 , 000 U / mL .	1
11628	According to the findings of this study , physical environment was poor and @DISEASE$ ward designs were not conducive	1
11629	A study that was done by Kieft et al	1
11630	[ 13 ] indicated that improved hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue and increase effectiveness in delivering care , improve patient safety , reduce patient and family stress , and improve outcomes and the overall healthcare quality	1
11631	The findings of this study concur with the study that was done by Brophy [ 14 ] , which indicated that the nurses were concerned with their occupational environment and voiced concern about the deteriorating hospital infrastructure .	1
11632	Tissue Culture Extracts	1
11633	The developed method was used to quantify the amount of lycorine in extracts of various parts of the H	1
11634	littoralis wild and tissue culture samples	1
11635	Lycorine contents in those samples were calculated using external standard method and summarized in Table 2 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )	1
11636	On the other hand , the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples are given in Table 3 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figure 1 ( c )	1
11637	The wild plant extract and callus ( initiated from 4	1
11638	5 M 2 , 4 - D alone and 9	1
11639	00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4	1
11640	5 M BAP combination ) were statistically analyzed	1
11641	There was significant production of lycorine in callus compared to wild type plant extract .	1
11642	Some consideration can be extrapolated from information reported on 14 cats affected by FeL and followed up until death or euthanasia	1
11643	On the basis of these reported cases , prognosis appears to vary from good to poor	1
11644	In fact , five cats died a few days or weeks after diagnosis [ 12 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 65 ]	1
11645	Some were affected by @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , but the real influence of @DISEASE$ infection on mortality was not clearly demonstrated in these cases [ 36 , 37 , 65 ]	1
11646	In other cases , euthanasia was performed after diagnosis because of a rapid clinical worsening [ 54 , 57 , 62 ] or due to a concurrent @DISEASE$ [ 13 ]	1
11647	Post mortem evaluation was obtained in three cats that died or were euthanized shortly after diagnosis , and all of them had visceral dissemination of @DISEASE$ amastigotes found in the spleen , lymph nodes , liver , stomach or in the large bowel [ 13 , 36 , 57 ] .	1

11660	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) Enhances @DISEASE$ 1 ( HIV - 1 ) Transcytosis across Epithelial Cells	1
11661	The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing	1
11662	In particular , the utility of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown	1
11663	Secondly , the analysis of the utilized @GENE$ at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering .	1
11664	Permanent treatment with the DIs PR - 619 and P22077 interfered with virus replication in a dose - dependent manner , resulting in a complete loss of replication capacity at 10 μM of PR - 619 or 15 μM of P22077 ( Figure 4C , E )	1
11665	Almost the same result was observed following structured treatment , indicating a severe block in spread of infection caused by DI treatment ( Figure 4B , D )	1
11666	No delay in peak virus replication was observed indicating the inhibitory effect of @GENE$ and @GENE$ must set in immediately after application of the drugs .	1
11667	In this study , we observed that DIs cause a general @GENE$ processing defect	1
11668	One explanation for this phenomenon would be that DIs directly inhibit the @GENE$	1
11669	However , this possibility could be excluded as in vitro processing assays revealed that the applied DIs , even at high concentrations , had no effect on the @GENE$	1
11670	Another explanation might be that polyubiquitin chains conjugated to @GENE$ sterically disturb the highly ordered lattice of assembling @GENE$ and thus exert a negative effect on the highly ordered @GENE$ - assembly during virus budding , and eventually also on the auto - activation of the @GENE$	1
11671	Another possibility may be the direct masking of the @GENE$ by bulky polyubiquitin adducts	1
11672	Accumulation of processing intermediates has been shown previously to interfere with viral infectivity in a trans - dominant negative manner [ 61 ] , which is in concert with our observations that treatment with DIs P22077 and PR - 619 reduces virus infectivity in a dose - dependent manner .	1
11673	[ 35 S ] - cysteine / methionine labeling mix was obtained from New England Nuclear ( Massachusetts , USA ) .	1
11674	Nuclear fractionation was performed as described earlier [ 23 ] .	1
11675	The expression of @GENE$ in the pulmonary myocardium are dysregulated in @DISEASE$ We chose to investigate the potential for genes involved in ion transport and calcium handling to be dysregulated in @DISEASE$	1

11677	1995 ) , and analyzed their expression in a publicly available mRNA microarray data @GENE$  et al	1
11678	( 2015 )	1
11679	This study used RNA extracted from left atrial appendage tissue obtained from @DISEASE$ patients who were divided into three categories : those with @DISEASE$ who either were or were not in sinus rhythm at the time tissue samples were collected , and those with no history of @DISEASE$	1
11680	The patient cohorts represent susceptibility to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , respectively , when compared to control samples with no history of @DISEASE$ ( Deshmukh et al	1
11681	2015 )	1
11682	We compared our genes of interest ( Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if gen@GENE$ our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP - seq enrichment of Nkx2 - 5 , Srf , and Mef2a in genomic regions proximal to genes within the pulmonary myo@GENE$ en@GENE$ twork @GENE$ ndi@GENE$ gulators dysregulated in @DIS@GENE$ ere @GENE$ Cacna2d2 , 0	1

11688	Measurements using both a silicon detector and UV sensitive films were combined to compute the total dose received by a particle traversing the exposure window	1
11689	The three vertically stacked lamps produced a nearly uniform dose distribution along the vertical axis thus every particle passing horizontally through the irradiation chamber received an identical dose	1
11690	The lamp width ( 100 mm ) was smaller than the width of the irradiation chamber window ( 260 mm ) so the lamp power was higher near the center of the irradiation chamber window compared to the edge	1
11691	The UV sensitive film indicated a power of approximately 120 µW / cm 2 in the center third of the window and 70 µW / cm 2 for the outer thirds	1
11692	The silicon detector was used to quantify the reflectivity of the aluminum sheet at approximately 15 % of the incident power	1
11693	Combining this data allowed the calculation of the average total dose of 2	1
11694	0 mJ / cm 2 to a particle traversing the window in 20 seconds	1
11695	Additionally , the silicon detector was used to confirm the attenuation of 222 - nm light through a single sheet of plastic film was 65 %	1
11696	The addition of one or two sheets of plastic film between the lamps and the irradiation chamber window yielded average doses of 1	1
11697	3 mJ / cm 2 and 0	1
11698	8 mJ / cm 2 , respectively .	1
11699	Due to its simplicity and sensitivity , some authors only use DPPH method for evaluating the antioxidant activities of essential oils	1
11700	Recently , in our bibliographic research , some examples could be found [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ]	1
11701	Sometimes , the decision of only using this method can be attributed to the low antioxidant activity detected , therefore the authors consided it unnecessary to pursue other methods	1
11702	One example is the case reported in [ 61 ] , in which the authors found low antioxidant activities of Commiphora ornifolia ( Balf	1
11703	f	1
11704	) Gillett and Commiphora parvifolia Engl	1
11705	oils even at high concentrations	1
11706	According to these results along with the chemical composition of the oils , in which phenolic compounds were absent , the authors probably considered it unnecessary to use other methods	1
11707	Another example is the oil of leaves of Olea europaea L	1
11708	cv	1
11709	Chemlali from Tunisia that also possesses low activity when compared to BHT [ 70 ] , because the main components were α - pinene and 2 , 6 - dimethyloctane , that is , non - phenolic compounds .	1
11710	Total RNA was collected from Hsu cells ( control and WNV infected ) using Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
11711	RNA was quantified and checked for quality using a bioanalyser	1
11712	The experiment was conducted in duplicate with two @GENE$ generated for @DISEASE$ - infected cells and two for uninfected control cells	1
11713	Sequencing was conducted in a single lane @GENE$ q2000 ( Micromon Facility , Monash University , Australia ) , generating more than 80 million reads per sample ( S1 Table ) .	1
11714	for the SEIR model with gamma - distributed latent and infectious periods ( further details are given in Protocol S1 )	1
11715	This equation translates into an expression for R 0 in terms of k and the other parameters , as is presented in equation 4	1
11716	Therefore , if we can estimate the growth rate k from data , we can use equation 4 to obtain an estimate of R 0 .	1
11717	Gram staining of smear and bacterial BAL - culture were performed according to standard methods [ 14 , 15 ]	1
11718	70 μL of BAL - fluid was centrifugated on a cytospin slide and Gram stained	1
11719	Samples were considered representative of the lower airways , if > 40 % of instilled volume was recovered and if < 1 % of nucleated cells are squamous epithelial cells on smear	1
11720	Undiluted and 1 μL of a 1 / 1000 dilution of BAL - fluid were inoculated on blood agar supplemented with X and @GENE$ factors incubated at 35 ° C in 5 % CO 2 , MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar incubated at 35 ° C in air	1
11721	Growth was assessed after 24 h , and after 48 h in case of no growth at 24 h	1
11722	Results were reported in semi - quantitative terms , with a growth of potential pathogens of ≥ 10 4 cfu / ml considered significant .	1
11723	There are six times more @GENE$ than @GENE$ in the @GENE$ , suggesting that @GENE$ might have more promiscuous substrate specificity than @GENE$ ( Komander et al	1
11724	, 2009 )	1
11725	However , emerging evidence indicate that @GENE$ have very specific cellular functions and are selective for certain substrates and ubiquitin chain types , suggesting that precise mechanisms exist to regulate @GENE$ ( Clague et al	1
11726	, 2013 )	1
11727	Although some @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , have been heavily studied in the nervous system , the function and regulation of most neuronal @GENE$ are poorly understood ( Todi and Paulson , 2011 ; Kowalski and Juo , 2012 )	1
11728	In this review article , we illustrate potential mechanisms of @GENE$ regulation by focusing on the role of the conserved DUB @GENE$ in the nervous system , and ways in which two @GENE$ control its function	1
11729	We highlight recent structural insights into how @GENE$ interact with and regulate @GENE$ , and discuss functions for the @GENE$ in the nervous system and across phylogeny .	1
11730	Participants were recruited mainly at work places ( e	1
11731	g	1
11732	Biotech companies , Universities , Stockholm Public Transport ) , and during open - days at LifeGene centers where retirees and children were also invited to join in the study	1
11733	The participants responded to a baseline web questionnaire addressing existing medical conditions , medication , previous seasonal flu vaccination , physical contact with other people , travelling patterns , physical activity and the intake of supplements	1
11734	The study participants reported via a web questionnaire ( flu event questionnaire ) their @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) during the 2009 / 2010 flu season , and responded to a follow - up web questionnaire ( including pandemic flu vaccination status ) in spring 2010	1
11735	Serum and heparin blood samples were drawn at study entry and after the flu season in spring 2010	1
11736	Prepaid envelopes and nasal swabs were also provided to the participants at study entry and they were invited to use them at the onset of @DISEASE$ and send them back for analysis as described below	1
11737	If the participant ' s swab was identified with any influenza RNA or @GENE$ NA @GENE$ the mean time between the first swab and the home visit was 2 , 5 weeks ) was performed to sample one nasal swab and a blood sample from the index study participant as well as from the household members after they agreed on an informed consent	1
11738	The study was approved by the regional ethics review board ( DN 2009 ( DN / 1183 and each individual study participant provided informed consent .	1
11739	While bat conservation efforts and emerging disease surveillance have the potential to be contradictory when not well designed , they are actually aligned by shared human threats that lead to both bat extinction and @DISEASE$ emergence	1
11740	For example , hunting of bats for bushmeat , a major threat to Old World fruit bats [ 56 , 64 ] , is a high risk activity that puts hunters and butchers in direct contact with blood and excreta and increases the risk of viral spillover from bats [ 65 , 66 ]	1
11741	Direct persecution of bats and attempts at population eradication ( e	1
11742	g	1
11743	, the recent culling of bats in Mauritius [ 67 , 68 ] ) may have countereffects by actually increasing viral prevalence in the bat population [ 69 ] , and also increasing the opportunities for viral spillover through direct contact with bats during culling [ 12 , 69 , 70 ]	1
11744	Similarly , the loss of bat habitat through land conversion for agricultural and livestock production and development , the primary threat to bats globally [ 3 , 71 ] , is a major risk factor for @DISEASE$ emergence [ 22 ]	1
11745	Clearing of forested habitats , specifically for agricultural crops ( e	1
11746	g	1
11747	, fruit orchards ) , leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites , and therefore displaces bat populations	1
11748	It also creates a direct interface between frugivorous bats and humans or livestock that can mediate viral species jumps ( e	1
11749	g	1
11750	, Old World fruit bats and @DISEASE$ in Malaysia and Bangladesh ) [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ]	1
11751	Cave disturbance , such as resource extraction ( guano or mineral mining ) , hunting , and ecotourism , is a major threat to bat populations [ 75 ] , especially for species less tolerant to human disturbance [ 76 ] , but can also lead to increased contact between bats and humans that may facilitate viral spillover	1
11752	For example , 7 of 13 cases of @DISEASE$ spillover to humans have been linked to gold mining activities , and other isolated cases have been linked to ecotourism in caves occupied by Rousettus aegyptiacus [ 77 ] .	1
11753	Since prediction of pseudoknotted structures are of interest to us , we only report running time comparison on pseudoknotted structures of our HK - PK data set	1
11754	Figure 3 presents result of time comparison between Iterative @GENE$ and @GENE$ in a log plot ( when log is in base 10 )	1
11755	The X axis shows log ( time ) for @GENE$ data points and the Y axis shows log ( time ) for Iterative @GENE$ on the HK - PK data set	1
11756	@GENE$ in this data set are between 26 and 400 bases long	1
11757	@GENE$ runs significantly faster than @GENE$ and finishes under 1	1
11758	5 seconds for even the longest @GENE$ in our data set ( 400 bases )	1
11759	@GENE$ is faster than Iterative @GENE$ on sequences of up to 47 bases , where Iterative @GENE$ starts being faster than @GENE$	1
11760	Iterative @GENE$ runs in less than 8	1
11761	3 seconds for all @GENE$ in this data set whereas @GENE$ runs for over 6000 seconds ( about 1	1
11762	7 hours ) on the longest @GENE$ in our data set	1
11763	information about performance of each method see Additional file 4 .	1
11764	We also compared Iterative HFold with IPknot [ 42 ]	1
11765	While IPknot is faster than Iterative HFold and uses less memory , we found that for the HK - PK and IP - pk168 data sets , Iterative HFold provides significantly more accurate predictions of pseudoknotted structures , compared with IPknot	1
11766	Based on our results on the HK - PK data set , Iterative HFold ' s performance with more than 5 % information about the true pseudoknot - free structure , is better than that of IPknot with default settings ( data shown in Additional file 3 )	1
11767	We note that Sato et al	1
11768	[ 42 ] find the performance of IPknot with predictions using " NUPACK " superior to all versions of @GENE$ , but since this model can be used for RNA sequences of length < 80 nucleotides , we did not compare our results with this version of @GENE$	1
11769	Among all different versions of @GENE$ we tested , we found all but γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1 setting producing similar confidence intervals for all but the HK - PK - free data sets , for which γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8 produces the best result ( data shown in Additional file 2 )	1
11770	While running parameter refinement with one iteration improved the confidence intervals in the HK - PK data set , it did not result in any improvement in accuracy in the rest of our data sets as in many cases @GENE$ failed to produce results	1
11771	We note that our results on the @GENE$ - pk168 data set with different weight parameters perfectly match the results of Sato et al	1
11772	[ 42 ] .	1
11773	The calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU )	1
11774	@DISEASE$ infection of @DISEASE$ is associated with limited cell death	1
11775	In @DISEASE$ cultures , JEV induced limited cell death , visualized as increased membrane permeability ( dark blue in Fig	1
11776	3A )	1
11777	This cell death was at least partially mediated by apopto@GENE$ cleaved caspase 3 was detected in the infected cultures ( red in Fig	1
11778	3B )	1
11779	Relating to the higher rate of infection , the Laos strain induced more cell death than the @DISEASE$ strain .	1
11780	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a disease which is caused by a relatively large , non - motile , rod - shaped pathogen called Mycobacterium tuberculosis	1
11781	@DISEASE$ is a major cause of illness and death worldwide , especially in Asia and Africa	1
11782	Despite the fact that @DISEASE$ is a curable illness , the tragedy is that @DISEASE$ remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen	1
11783	The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for @DISEASE$ patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province , South Africa	1
11784	Qualitative , exploratory , and descriptive designs were used	1
11785	A non - probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants	1
11786	The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years ' experience caring for @DISEASE$ patients at a regional hospital were explored , and it was guided by data saturation	1
11787	Data were collected through in - depth individual interviews	1
11788	Data were analyzed using Colaizzi ' s method	1
11789	Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study	1
11790	The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data : challenges of the working environment , problems impacting on the quality of nursing care , fear , anxiety , stress and risk of contracting infection , nurses ' perceptions towards patients , support structure available in the hospital , and support needs for the nurses	1
11791	Therefore , there is an urgent need to address the challenges experienced by nurses caring for @DISEASE$ through provision of a positive practice work environment .	1
11792	The review clearly showed the consistency in the scholarly literature , that it is common to find that complex issues are oversimplified , whereby culture is used to justify the assigning of blame to minority groups ( Leach and Tadros 2014 ; Lupton 2016 )	1
11793	The review highlighted the role of politics and power in shaping different narratives , whereby powerful institutions assert particular narratives ( often marginalizing the populations ) , which are Bpushedt o frame policies , publications , interventions , and funding agendas , while the narratives of the marginalized populations ( those voiced by or representing marginalized people ) are marginalized ( Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005 )	1
11794	This type of outbreak narrative was evident in the three epidemics discussed in this paper	1
11795	In Toronto , @DISEASE$ became a racialized disease , ultimately victimizing and excluding the Asian - Canadian community ( Jacobs 2007 ; Ali 2008 )	1
11796	The spread of the @DISEASE$ in Brazil is largely attributed to the consequences of globalization , including the widening habitat of the Aedes mosquito vector and increased human and air travel ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ; Gyawali et al	1
11797	2016 ; Fast et al	1
11798	2015 ; World Health Organization 2017e ; Ordaz - Németh et al	1
11799	2017 )	1
11800	Cultural explanations are prominent in the outbreak narrative speaking to Ebola in Liberia , specifically the human consumption of bush meat and local / traditional burial practices that involve the touching and kissing of the deceased ( Hagan et al	1
11801	2015 ; Kobayashi et al	1
11802	2015 ; Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c ; Washington and Meltzer 2015 ; Ng 2008 ) .	1
11803	The finding that the literature on how decisions about what research is funded and conducted during disease epidemics almost exclusively focused on the ethical implications ( and did not question the potential power imbalances with regard to who identified the research issue / question and who led the research for example ) , was surprising , since this was a key theme in the broad politics of epidemics literature	1
11804	This could , in part , be a reflection of the limitations of the search engines and strategy used in the study which excluded publications , which were deemed biomedical	1
11805	Conversely , it may be a reflection of limited support for critical research and related publications .	1
11806	Between May 2006 and June 2009 , 722 patients with suspected @DISEASE$ or severe @DISEASE$ were admitted to HTD	1
11807	@DISEASE$ was diagnosed in 108 patients	1
11808	Seven cases were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria	1
11809	We also excluded 311 other patients as they did not meet the inclusion criteria for hospital controls ( Figure 2 )	1
11810	It was not possible to recruit community controls at the residency of one S	1
11811	suis case because of the distance from the study site ( Central Viet Nam , 800 kms from Ho Chi Minh City )	1
11812	During the period of recruitment we therefore included 101 cases of confirmed @DISEASE$ , 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls for analysis ( Figure 2 )	1
11813	Patients were checked by nurses and doctors for @DISEASE$ on forearms , hands and feet	1

11819	Figure 11 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 4 ~ 5	1
11820	The index patient was walking ( e	1
11821	g	1
11822	towards the lavatory ) and coughed at different location	1
11823	Same as the intake fraction distribution shown in Figure 6 , local area around the index patient has a significantly higher intake dose than further area	1
11824	The intake fraction and the infection risk of each passenger is mainly depended on the distance between the passenger and the cough location	1
11825	Thus , if the index patient coughs during walking in the aisle or waiting outside the lavatory , another high - dose region will be formed around the current location of the index patient , rather than the seat location ( 9E )	1
11826	The frequent walking of the index patient may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and increase the infection risk of the passengers who are seated far from the seat location of the index patient	1
11827	Passengers who are seated close to the lavatory may also have significantly high infection risks for the index patient may need to use the lavatory frequently	1
11828	Thus the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin is also highly depended on the behavior characteristics of the index patient	1
11829	The risk assessment results will be more accurate when considering the droplets dispersion process under different walking activities of the index patient	1
11830	So a better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient will be very important and useful for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin .	1
11831	A number of pharmacologic agents have been used during the inflammatory phase of @DISEASE$	1
11832	Treatment with IVIG in @DISEASE$ patients can inhibit @DISEASE$ formation , implying a rol@GENE$ odies in disease pathogenesis	1
11833	However , it is unclear how IVIG actually functions in this setting and if specific antibody responses are responsible for pathogenesis	1
11834	Potential functions of IVIG include : Replacement for deficient specific protective antibody , anti - idiotype response ag@GENE$ odies , B cell downregulation , upregulation of regulatory T cells , downregulation of neutrophil function , downregulation of dendritic cell function , and superantigen neutralization	1
11835	Recent reviews have explored these functions [ 58 , 59 ]	1
11836	The main treatment modalities used for refractory treatment are steroids , calcineurin inhibitors @GENE$ odies ; all of which have broad immunological effects [ 60 , 61 ]	1

11843	A fourth ( although not strictly monophyletic ) clade ( D ) of viral sequences from Australian cats contained three @GENE$ identical to that of an FPV vaccine strain ( Purevax ; Genbank accession no	1
11844	EU498680 ) and two sequences that are very closely related to the vaccine strain	1
11845	In one of these , from a 6 - week - old kitten with @DISEASE$ and failure to gain weight , the vaccine strain was unlikely to be the cause of the cat ' s clinical signs	1
11846	@DISEASE$ was suspected because a multiplex qPCR faecal panel was positive for Giardia spp	1
11847	and Canine protoparvovirus 1	1
11848	However , the cat , from Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory , had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine strain .	1

11864	In sections of duodenum and jejunum from the 11 representative cases , there was a mild to severe @DISEASE$ , characterized by variable blunting , fusion and loss of villi , collapse of the lamina propria , loss of crypts and replacement by abundant coccobacilli and necrotic debris	1
11865	The remaining crypts were often ectatic , with variable numbers of crypt abscesses ( Figure 4 )	1
11866	Evidence of multifocal crypt regeneration was also variably present	1
11867	The submucosa and tunica muscularis were variably expanded by congestion , fibrin , oedema , haemorrhage , perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells , macrophages exhibiting erythrophagocytosis , occasional neutrophils and rare eosinophils	1
11868	In sections of mesenteric lymph nodes , the most common finding was @DISEASE$ with accentuation of the reticuloendothelial architecture ( Figure 4 )	1
11869	Depleted lymphoid follicles were small , poorly populated and contained central accumulations of hyalinized eosinophilic material ( follicular hyalinosis ) with variable numbers of tangible body macrophages	1
11870	The subcapsular and medullary sinuses were expanded by erythrocytes , oedema fluid and moderate to markedly increased numbers of macrophages , some exhibiting @DISEASE$ .	1
11871	The study that created @GENE$ described a total of 44 @GENE$ and 61 @GENE$	1
11872	Other @GENE$ expressed , @GENE$ , and showed no binding to @GENE$	1
11873	There was generally a lack of oligoclonal response with just six @GENE$ duplicated and only the @GENE$ ( 3 times ) and three other @GENE$ duplicated	1
11874	As these antibodies were created with non - native @GENE$ and @GENE$ pairings , they may have non - specific interactions [ 108 ]	1
11875	This is one of the major challenges in the burgeoning bispecific @GENE$ field [ 109 ]	1
11876	Evidence of in situ maturation of @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ , also does not preclude such an antibody targeting a @GENE$	1
11877	Notably , two other rare clones ( only one transcript each from the 44 sequence reads ) showed weak binding to the same spheroid ICIs	1
11878	One of these weak binding @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) also bound plasma cells directly and was subsequently shown to bind @GENE$ of @GENE$	1
11879	This highlights the non - specific autoimmune potential of @GENE$ from these types of pathologic infiltrates , which will be reviewed later .	1

11907	In Malaysia , as in most countries where it is used , BCG vaccination is recommended universally for all infants at birth or shortly after birth	1
11908	Following intradermal inoculation of the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain at the deltoid region of the left arm , a small papule usually appears after 2 weeks , gradually enlarges and typically ulcerates within 2 - 4 months , and slowly heals over the next few months to form the BCG scar [ 4 ] .	1

11922	Participants also shared recent advances in the capacity to implement stewardship and infection prevention and control policies among different Singapore institutions including nursing homes .	1
11923	Many participants proposed the idea that Singapore can serve as a research hub owing to its unique positioning and research capacity	1
11924	Sharing innovative findings both on science , clinical practice and exemplary policy implementation strategies could prove helpful to neighboring countries that share some contextual factors with Singapore .	1
11925	City - level total carbon accounting As mentioned in Table 1 , urban emissions inventory is the key for city - level total carbon accounting	1
11926	However , there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [ 21 ]	1
11927	Based on China ' s energy statistic and the reference approach of IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse gas Emission Inventories , there are mainly three approach to account , i	1
11928	e	1
11929	primary energy consumption ( e	1

11934	Compared with the primary energy consumption accounting and the final energy consumption accounting , apparent energy consumption data [ 78 , 79 ] from the comprehensive energy balance table was recommended for this study	1
11935	As shown in the Table 3 , the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules , namely , 1 ) total energy available for local consumption as a result of interprovincial and international energy trades , 2 ) input - output of energy conversion transformation for thermal power , heating , coking , petroleum refining , and gas production , 3 ) final consumption due to primary industry , secondary industry , tertiary industry , and residential consumption	1
11936	Primary industry , namely , agriculture , mainly includes farming , forestry , animal husbandry , and fishery	1
11937	Secondary industry includes manufacturing industries and construction industry	1
11938	Tertiary industry includes transportation , storage , post and telecommunication services , wholesale , retail trade and catering services , and other service sectors	1
11939	Then , we calculated energy - related carbon emissions by energy types according to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table , as follows the equation :	1

11946	5 % and 74	1
11947	9 % , respectively , compared to HeLa cells during the immediate early stage	1
11948	At the late infection stage , SCH07072 cells expressed 83	1
11949	1 % and 87 % less @GENE$ , respectively , than those of HeLa cells after virus challenge ( Figure 5C )	1
11950	However , @GENE$ and @GENE$ levels were 69	1
11951	4 % and 60	1
11952	7 % lower than in HeLa cells during the immediate early stage of muSCH cell infection , and were similar to the @GENE$ content seen in SCH07072 cells	1
11953	However , at the late stage of infection , the @GENE$ accumulation patterns in muSCH cells were similar to those in HeLa cells ( Figure 5C ) .	1
11954	The pathogenic agent of @DISEASE$ is a new coronavirus which was initially identified from the respiratory content of a patient who was infected , and died , as a result of infection from a mysterious @DISEASE$ showing @DISEASE$ like symptoms in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [ 3 ]	1
11955	Initially , a group of healthcare personnel working in a hospital in Jordan contracted a @DISEASE$ in April 2012 , the source of which was not known [ 4 ]	1
11956	Later in June 2012 , an elderly businessman with severe @DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ was admitted to a Saudi hospital	1
11957	The coronavirus detected from his sputum was not known before and for a while [ 15 ] .	1

11963	For Streptococcus species , although coinfection cases were higher than single infection cases , the difference did not generate a significant P value	1
11964	Higher rates of bacterial coinfections by S	1
11965	pneumoniae and K pneumoniae in synergy with viruses may indicate that predominant @DISEASE$ viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria .	1
11966	For appropriate preventive measures and prompt interventions , determination of vulnerable age groups is important	1
11967	Table 3 shows a comparison of distribution patterns of indicated respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens between < 1 year and 1 - 5 year age groups	1
11968	As we can see here , the total number of specimens which had come out positive for pathogens was significantly higher in less than one year age group ( 87 % ) compared to [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The majority of respiratory viral pathogens were highly prevalent in < 1 year age group of children and the detections of HRV ( 54 / 63 ) and RSV ( 54 / 62 ) were almost confined to this age group	1
11969	However , a significant P value was found in case of RSV ( P = 0	1
11970	0473 , RR = 1	1
11971	167 ( 7 ) 10 ( 6 ) 4 ( 9 ) NA - - ( 8 / 11 ) were confined to less than 1 year old children , although the results did not show significant differences between the two age groups	1
11972	Notably , pathogen detection rates dropped to almost 2 % for all viruses for more than three - year old children ( data not shown )	1
11973	Due to nil or very low levels of pathogen detection frequency ( less than five ) , χ 2 - test was not performed for pathogens other than HRV , RSV , HBoV , and HMPV	1
11974	Over all , the data suggest that under - one children are more likely to receive attention due to their vulnerability to infections by respiratory viral pathogens	1
11975	Coinfection is a frequently occurring phenomenon in numerous infections and this phenomenon has attracted a great deal of recent attention	1
11976	Respiratory viral pathogens including influenza virus have been reported to predispose to secondary @DISEASE$ [ 16 ] , hence , data analysis targeting coinfection patterns was performed	1
11977	Out of 46 bacterial isolates , 40 ( 87 % ) were associated with coinfections	1
11978	On the other hand , 59 % ( 126 out of 213 ) of total viral agents were accomplices in coinfections	1
11979	In summary , the data indicate that coinfection is a major phenomenon in under - five children with @DISEASE$ and the results are consistent with previously published reports on this subject .	1

11984	BLASTn ( Altschul et al	1
11985	1990 ) was used to align gene sequences for the @GENE$ candidates , using sequence data from the mouse ( Mus musculus ) and the 13lined ground squirrel ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) , the only available genome from the Sciuridae family ( GenBank Accession number AGTP01000001 - 01024510 ) ( Benson et al	1
11986	2010 )	1
11987	Conserved regions between the mouse and 13lined ground squirrel were assumed to be good candidates for sequence conservation between red and grey squirrels	1
11988	Those conserved regions were then sequenced to investigate their suitability to amplify host DNA in a qPCR ( as described in Online Resource S1 ) .	1

11990	After we identified the direct 1918 human lineage viruses , we were able to adjust the dates of the later samples to account for a period of dormancy ( Figure 3 )	1
11991	When we shifted the " frozen " samples back 21 years ( i	1
11992	e	1
11993	, sequences from 1976 were assigned a recalibrated date of 1955 ) , we see the data lines up almost perfectly ( r 2 = 0	1
11994	989 ; mutation rate = 14	1
11995	4 )	1
11996	The exact amount of time - frame adjustment was not critical ; adjustments ranging from 20 to 30 years all gave excellent alignments , with correlation coefficients above 98 %	1
11997	The observed accumulation rate of roughly 14 mutations per year ( 1	1
11998	1 × 10 - 3 mutations per site per year ) is more or less consistent with previous estimates ( e	1
11999	g	1
12000	, [ 39 , 57 ] )	1
12001	The accumulation of non - synonymous mutations in @GENE$ is also shown in Figure 3	1
12002	The non - synonymous mutations are not as abundant , as expected , but they are still accumulating at a rapid and constant rate	1
12003	There were an average of 2	1
12004	4 amino acid changes per year ( 0	1
12005	6 × 10 - 3 mutations per codon per year ) .	1
12006	Human @DISEASE$ has such a high mutation rate that , even within a single host individual , the virus quickly becomes a genetically diverse " swarm " [ 61 , 62 ]	1
12007	Yet , globally human @DISEASE$ is monophyletic and all current variation is of recent origin	1
12008	This is only possible if almost all human influenza lineages rapidly go extinct	1
12009	Moreover , we present strong evidence that the H1N1 @GENE$ een systematically degenerating since 1918	1
12010	This is evidenced by continuous , systematic , and rapid changes in the H1N1 @GENE$ ghout its history	1
12011	For example , there was an especially rapid and monotonic accumulation of mutations during a single pandemic ( Figure 1 )	1
12012	Similarly , there was a continuous and rapid accumulation of mutations over the entire history of the virus ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , including a similar steady increase in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions ( Figure 3 )	1
12013	While mutations accumulated in the human H1N1s , there was a parallel accumulation of mutations in the porcine H1N1 lineage ( Figure 4 )	1
12014	Fitch , et al	1
12015	[ 36 ] also showed a linear mutation accumulation curve	1
12016	The " gnarled trunk " of Ito , et al	1
12017	[ 42 ] should be buried in our data as well , but it will be swamped by the pervasive , genome - wide accumulation of mutations not under active selection .	1
12018	KFDV is only found in India ( Figure 1 ) , although a similar genetic variant , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) has been detected in Saudi Arabia [ 17 , 47 ]	1
12019	@DISEASE$ is mainly transmitted by ticks belonging to the genus Hemaphysalis but other tick genera have also been shown to be able to transmit @DISEASE$ [ 64 , 65 ]	1
12020	During @DISEASE$ , the initial phase is similar to @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , but it may also include bleeding from the nose , mouth or gastrointestinal tract [ 65 , 66 ]	1
12021	The second phase , which is experienced by 1 - 20 % of the cases , includes @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ , however , no evidence of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ have been found [ 65 ]	1
12022	There are about 400 - 500 reported annual cases of @DISEASE$ [ 47 ] , with case fatality rates ranging from 3 to 10 % [ 17 , 65 ]	1
12023	In 1990 a @DISEASE$ vaccine was developed , although it provided some protection , due to low efficacy , the number of cases still increased from 1999 to 2012 [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ]	1
12024	Treatment of @DISEASE$ is limited to supportive care [ 47 ] .	1
12025	The study has several limitations	1
12026	First , the small sample size of the select critically ill patient population analyzed limits the general applicability of our findings	1
12027	Moreover , since our study included @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$ secondary to @DISEASE$ who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy , our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe @DISEASE$ patients in clinical practice	1
12028	Second , the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin , remai@GENE$ er elucidated	1
12029	Third , cases of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ , were not included , mainly because few patients had these types of @DISEASE$	1
12030	Fourth , patients with non - infectious causes of @DISEASE$ that can often mimic infectious causes , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and drug - induced @DISEASE$ , were also excluded from our analyses	1
12031	The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria	1
12032	Finally , all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid	1
12033	Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means , such as blood culture , endotracheal aspirates culture , urinary pneumococcal antigen test , and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples , as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was dem@GENE$ nts with coincidental @DISEASE$ or colonization may have been included .	1
12034	Background : Canine @DISEASE$ ( CaKoV ) has been detected both in healthy and @DISEASE$ dogs and in asymptomatic wild carnivores	1
12035	In this study , we conducted a survey of @DISEASE$ at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018	1
12036	Results : Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs ( n = 55 ) and dogs with @DISEASE$ ( n = 252 )	1
12037	Of 307 swab samples tested by using one - step RT - PCR specific to 3D gene , w@GENE$ CaKoV positivity at 17	1
12038	59 % ( 54 / 307 )	1
12039	CaKoVs could be detected in both sick ( 19	1
12040	44 % ) and healthy ( 9	1
12041	09 % ) animals	1
12042	In relation to age group , CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs ( 25	1
12043	45 % )	1
12044	Our result showed no seasonal pattern of @DISEASE$ infection in domestic dogs	1
12045	In this study , we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing ( n = 4 ) or 3D and VP1 gen@GENE$ quencing ( n = 8 )	1
12046	Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole g@GENE$  CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99	1
12047	5 % amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand	1
12048	Conclusions : In conclusion , this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand	1
12049	CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs	1
12050	The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs	1
12051	Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs	1
12052	Our result raises the concerns to vet practitioners that @DISEASE$ in dogs due to canine @DISEASE$ should not be ignored .	1
12053	In this study , we used proteomics to investigate the global profiles of differentially expressed @GENE$ under @DISEASE$	1
12054	The features of our experimental design and data analysis are as follows : 1	1
12055	The kinetic changes in the expression levels of cell@GENE$ g the infection course , consisting of five different time points , were quantified , which represented an improvement over a cross - sectional picture if only a sample from a single time point was analysed ; these results provided us a kinetic view of the changed expression of cell@GENE$ r the cytopathic insult of @DISEASE$	1
12056	2	1
12057	Two mocks were analysed	1
12058	These two mocks helped to distinguish the natural kinetics of the cellular@GENE$ on and helped to set reasonable standards to screen the DEPs	1
12059	3@GENE$ ree biological replicates were prepared for each sample to assess inter - experimental variations	1
12060	4	1
12061	The DEPs ide@GENE$ ed over the whole infection process were determined to be significant by an analysis of variance test , while those at each of the five time points were determined to be significant by the two - tailed unpaired t test .	1

12065	The reaction was quenched with water , the solvent removed in vacuo and the residue was purified with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography , yielding 7 as a white solid .	1
12066	Notable recent examples include novel @DISEASE$ strains , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ aureus , which all exploit today ' s complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world	1
12067	In the context of human @DISEASE$ , the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [ 2 ]	1
12068	Air travel likely drives the global circulation of @DISEASE$ [ 3 ] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally - persistent strains between epidemic seasons	1
12069	Retrospective modeling of the ' Hong Kong flu ' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [ 4 ]	1
12070	Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on @DISEASE$ virus spread , e	1

12080	Extent of cross - reactivity of commercially available @GENE$	1
12081	To assess the specificity of @GENE$ in our hands for the different @GENE$ , HEK293T cells were transfected with each @GENE$ and cell lysates were then analyzed by WB .	1
12082	The use of @GENE$ has been particularly challenging for hantavirus / reservoir research	1
12083	Identification of @GENE$ could shed light on what cells respond during @DISEASE$ infection of reservoir hosts	1
12084	While c@GENE$ end to be more divergent , i@GENE$  such as a@GENE$  tend to be more conserved , particularly p@GENE$  Thus , it is likely that many available a@GENE$ o h@GENE$  Mus musculus ) or N@GENE$ ill be cross - reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species	1
12085	Without information as to which proteins may be of interest , screening of a@GENE$ s a daunting and expensive task since most likely will not be informative	1
12086	However , combined with RNA - Seq and metabolomic data , it is likely that target proteins and pathways can be identified so that investigators can focus their efforts and resources	1
12087	In addition , software tools can help predict whether antibodies may be cross - reactive to proteins from reservoir hosts [ 109 ] .	1
12088	The seasonal trend of the exacerbations is shown in Figure 4	1
12089	Children < 6 years showed a peak of exacerbations in autumn and winter concurrently with the infectious epidemic season , while school - aged children and adolescents showed a different trend with a peak in early autumn and another one during the pollen season .	1
12090	Nurses provide nursing care to the patients during the period of their hospitalization	1
12091	The way nurses perceive patients matters ; the nurses play a major role in the patients ' recovery	1
12092	The following sub - themes will be discussed under nurses ' perceptions of their work ; feelings and nurses ' emotions towards patients .	1
12093	Following attachment of coronavirus particles to virus specific receptors on the host cell and uptake of the virus into the cytoplasm , @GENE$ is released	1
12094	This @GENE$ is recognised directly by the host cell translation machinery and two large @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , of approximately 400 and 800 kDa are translated	1
12095	The two polyproteins encode the 15 ( IBV ) or 16 ( all other coronaviruses ) @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which are generated by co - or post - translational cleavage by @GENE$	1
12096	These proteins assemble into @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , providing the virus with the enzymes required for viral RNA transcription and replication , as well as proof - reading and capping of new viral transcripts [ 1 ]	1
12097	In addition , expression of the @GENE$ triggers the rearrangement of host cell membranes , presumed to provide a platform for the assembly of @GENE$	1
12098	It is likely that expression of the @GENE$ is responsible for inducing these rearrangements	1
12099	Data from closely related @DISEASE$ , equine arterivirus ( EAV ) , demonstrated that expression of ns@GENE$ homologues of ns@GENE$  coronaviruses ) , in the absence of other vi@GENE$ was sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements and mutation of ns@GENE$ ocked this function [ 2 , 3 ]	1
12100	No@GENE$ om MHV is known to play a role in formation of rearranged membranes because viruses containing mutant nsp4s show defects in membrane rearrangements and a reduction in virus replication [ 4 , 5 ]	1
12101	Furthermore , co - expression of ns@GENE$ th the C @GENE$  ns@GENE$ om MHV resulted in the relocation of both proteins from diffuse in the cytoplasm to punctate [ 6 ]	1
12102	The authors hypothesised that interaction between these proteins may result in the rearrangement of host membranes [ 6 ]	1
12103	However , the precise mechanism by which the ns@GENE$ duce membrane rearrangements remains to be elucidated .	1
12104	Currently computational RNA structure prediction methods mainly focus on predicting RNA secondary structure - the set of @GENE$ that form when @GENE$ fold	1
12105	When multiple @GENE$ ( evolutionarily related ) RNA sequences are available , the secondary structure of the sequences can be predicted using multiple sequence alignment and comparative sequence analysis [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
12106	Alternative approaches , which can be used to predict secondary structure of a single sequence , are	1
12107	Difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ; TargetMol , Boston , MA , USA ) and N1 , N11 - Diethylnorspermine ( DENSpm ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX , USA ) were diluted to 100 × solution ( 100 mM and 10 mM , respectively ) in sterile water	1
12108	For DFMO treatments , cells were trypsinized and reseeded with fresh medium supplemented with 2 % serum	1
12109	Following overnight attachment , cells were treated with 100 µM , 500 µM , 1 mM , or 2 mM DFMO	1
12110	Cells were incubated with DFMO for 96 h to allow for depletion of polyamines in Vero cells	1
12111	For DENSpm treatment , cells were treated with 100 nM , 1 µM , 10 µM , 100 µM , and 1 mM 16 h prior to infection	1
12112	During infection , media was cleared and saved from the cells	1
12113	The same medium containing DFMO and DENSpm was then used to replenish the cells following infection	1
12114	Cells were incubated at the appropriate temperature for the duration of the infection .	1
12115	Our study had several limitations	1
12116	First , our study was a retrospective design in a single - center , so confounding variables , such as antibiotics regimen or inconsistent timing of antipyretics administration , may have possibly affected the clinical course of @DISEASE$ or response to antipyretic treatment	1
12117	Second , our study had few reflected unmeasurable variables , such as the genotype of adenovirus , so the difference in the severity of illness between the Adv and Non - Adv groups may have led to the difference in the characteristics of @DISEASE$ and its response to antipyretics	1
12118	Third , we conducted our study in a military hospital , so our cohort was not representative of the general population , since the military environment has different characteristics , such as living environment , nutrition / immune status , and mode of pathogen spread	1
12119	Fourth , there was selection bias in that all patients admitted with @DISEASE$ could not have respiratory PCR tests performed ; the examination was limited to an upper respiratory tract , and Adv serotype or viral burden analyses were not performed	1
12120	Fifth , several potentially relevant pathogens were identified in the study patients	1
12121	Thus , it is uncertain whether adenovirus was the " leading " pathogen in all patients with multiple pathogens that included adenovirus	1
12122	Additionally , it is uncertain whether the patients with unknown pathogens were not infected with pathogens .	1
12123	Taken together , a model is proposed whereby hemodynamic stress triggers mechanosensory ( stretch - stress ) signaling from the sarcomere and initiates NO signaling cascades from the adjacent pulmonary epithelia , which are transmitted back to the pulmonary myocardium myocyte nuclei ( Figure 5 )	1
12124	This leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression , enabling fine - tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium , such as the rate and force of contraction , as well as influencing blood volume , ion transport , and hormone signaling	1
12125	Our findings indicate that genetic variability at these loci can modify levels of gene expression in the pulmonary myocardium , and could modify venous return to the left atrium as well as pathological features such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and initiation of ectopic beats	1
12126	Hence the genes / loci identified in this study could be linked to @DISEASE$ in humans triggered by pulmonary events	1
12127	Indeed , these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ) and are therefore viable candidates for involvement in the pathobiology of @DISEASE$ .	1
12128	These factors include the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and tight junction proteins @GENE$ and occluding	1
12129	A clear understanding of the detailed mechanisms of HCV entry may shed light in the ways to prevent the liver graft from @DISEASE$ recurrence .	1
12130	Acidic pH and @GENE$ enhance transcytosis of HIV - 1	1
12131	During hospital stay , @DISEASE$ cases received the following antibiotics : Amoxicillin ( n = 111 , 94	1
12132	1 % ) , Ceftriaxone ( n = 3 , 2	1
12133	6 % ) , Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid ( n = 3 , 2	1
12134	5 % ) , Ciprofloxacin ( n = 1 , 0	1
12135	8 % ) , and Vancomycin ( n = 2 , 1	1
12136	6 % )	1
12137	Fifty - one ( 43	1
12138	2 % ) received oxygen for a median length of 2 days ( IQR : 1 - 3 days ) , and 3 ( 2	1
12139	5 % ) had blood transfusions	1
12140	Three patients with @DISEASE$ were tested for microbial detection	1
12141	Five patients died ( lethality : 4	1
12142	2 % ) ; death was directly related to @DISEASE$ in 4 patients ( Table 2 )	1
12143	Table 1 compares the clinical signs and symptoms at admission between cases and controls , underlying conditions and biological findings	1
12144	@DISEASE$ cases differed from controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms as well as vital signs at admission , but not in terms of demographic factors or past medical history	1
12145	@DISEASE$ cases were more frequently @DISEASE$ ( defined as oxygen saturation < 90 % ) at admission than the controls ( 30	1
12146	5 % vs	1
12147	0 % , P < 0	1
12148	001 )	1
12149	PCV coverage was zero in both groups .	1
12150	Rhinovirus was detected in almost 25 % of @DISEASE$ cases of our series , but the detection rate was not different between cases and controls	1
12151	However , this observation does formally excludes that rhinovirus could play a role in the etiology of @DISEASE$	1
12152	Jain et al	1
12153	recently observed that rhinovirus was detected in 27 % of U	1
12154	S	1
12155	children with @DISEASE$ requiring hospitalization [ 27 ] ; this large study had however no control group , it was also not possible to estimate the prevalence of respiratory detection in children without @DISEASE$	1
12156	Growing evidence suggests the role of rhinovirus in the etiology of @DISEASE$ [ 28 ] or related to the risk of secondary @DISEASE$ [ 29 ]	1
12157	Other viruses , such as bocavirus or adenovirus were also equally prevalent in cases and controls	1
12158	Again , this finding does not exclude completely their implication in @DISEASE$ etiology in children from Mali	1
12159	However these viruses were poorly described as causative agents of @DISEASE$ in children from other sub - Saharan African countries .	1
12160	Surveys have shown that the percentage of infected cats is not negligible in some endemic areas ( Table 2 )	1
12161	In cats , disease and infection may persist for very long periods and cats have been shown to be infectious to sand flies in experimental xenodiagnosis studies both in the Old and New Worlds	1
12162	They may , therefore , play some role in the transmission of L	1
12163	infantum in regions where many cats are infected [ 43 ] .	1
12164	Instead , our analyses lead to our novel hypotheses that @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , as well as the molecular complexes they reside in , possess antiviral activity	1
12165	For instance , @GENE$ is a component of large cytoplasmic structures known as vaults , whose functions are poorly understood	1
12166	Although vaults are extremely ancient , dating back to the origin of eukaryotes , they have been lost in multiple lineages [ 9 ] , suggesting that they are not universally necessary to perform an essential , housekeeping function	1
12167	Instead , there are several tantalizing pieces of evidence that vaults may be involved in immunity	1
12168	These include an increased number of vaults in immune cell types , @GENE$ - upregulation of @GENE$ , the major component of vaults , and upregulation of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) on infection with pathogens such as @DISEASE$ [ 45 ]	1
12169	PARP4 itsel@GENE$ resent at , 10 molecules per vault , but its functional role there is unknown [ 44 ]	1
12170	However , our observation that the positively selected residues we find in PARP4 are l@GENE$ ed to a single disordered region in PARP4 sugge@GENE$ model for its role in vault - mediated immunity	1
12171	Such a localized pattern of positively selected sites is reminiscent of two well - characterized rapidly evolving antiviral f@GENE$ d @GENE$ hown@GENE$ be on the ' offensive ' ( i	1

12175	Thus , we infer that the positively selected region of PARP4 ( exo@GENE$ n @GENE$  has evolved to maintain recognition of a factor encoded by pathogens that can infect many diverse mammalian lineages , or is a common means to counteract independent unrelated pathogens	1
12176	This interaction may be used to directly ADPribosylate viral compo@GENE$ ld affect their activity and impede infection	1
12177	Alternatively , independent of ADP - ribosylation , PARP4 inter@GENE$  may recruit viral prote@GENE$ t structures within virally infected cells , wherein the vault proteins might sequester viral proteins and thereby impede their infectivity .	1
12178	@GENE$ from primates have been deposited to Genbank under accession numbers KJ699095 - KJ699100	1
12179	@GENE$ have been deposited to Genbank under accession numbers KJ697725 - KJ697749 .	1
12180	We were also able to identify one @GENE$ in the sequence of the @GENE$ of the virus HIV - 1 group M subtype B ( strain 89	1
12181	6 )	1
12182	@GENE$ colocalizes with @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and contributes to the inhibition of autophagic maturation , thus protecting the virus from elimination by autophagy	1
12183	61 , 67 The proteins @GENE$ from human @DISEASE$ and neurovirulence factor ICP34 @GENE$ uman herpesvirus ( HSV ) both interact with BECN1 @GENE$ specific BECN1 @GENE$  interaction is required for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomes	1
12184	[ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] 73 While iLIR c@GENE$ detect several WxxL motifs in TRS1 s@GENE$ ce , a single one in an intrin@GENE$ entified for ICP34 @GENE$ sequence ( 64 - RQWLHV - 69 ) is quite well conserved among 4 strains of HSV - 1 and one strain of HSV - 2	1
12185	However , to date , there is no evidence of association between ICP34 @GENE$ 3 pr@GENE$ 	1
12186	A direct approach to prevent the transmission of @DISEASE$ is inactivation of the corresponding airborne pathogens , and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet ( UV ) light has long been established 6 - 8	1
12187	Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug - sensitive and multi - drug - resistant bacteria 9 , as well as differing strains of viruses 10	1
12188	However , the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard , being both carcinogenic and @DISEASE$ 11 , 12 .	1
12189	The crystal structure also provides an explanation for the weak inhibition shown by the parent eriodictyol and three other geranylated flavonoids ( 3 0 - O - methyldiplacone , 4 0 - Omethyldiplacone and mimulone ) studied in this manuscript ( Table 2 ; Fig	1
12190	2b )	1
12191	The geranyl group made a suitable hydrophobic interaction with four aromatic residues : Phe353 , Trp354 , Phe460 and Tyr587	1
12192	Therefore Table 2 Structures and inhibitory activities ( IC 50 ) of flavonoid - based @GENE$ NanI inhibitors	1
12193	of Ala292 and@GENE$ ains of Ile327 and Phe347	1
12194	On the other hand , eliminating the C3 0 hydroxyl group ( mimulone , IC 50 of 6	1
12195	1 mM ) does not lead to structural clashes with the protein but prevents hydrogen - bond formation	1
12196	Therefore , maintaining the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl group is important for the further development of diplacone - b@GENE$ ASE$ NanI inhibitors .	1
12197	Based on our experiments on our HK - PK and HK - PKfree data sets that include 88 @GENE$ , and 337 pseudoknot - free structures respectively , ranging in length from 10 to 400 nucleotides , a single run of Iterative HFold does not take more than 9 seconds time and 62 MB of memory	1
12198	In contrast , one of the best heuristic methods , HotKnots V2	1
12199	0 , takes 1	1
12200	7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides	1
12201	Therefore our method is practical for prediction of @GENE$	1
12202	Iterative HFold bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK - PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot , ( ( 72	1

12212	Iterative HFold ' s accuracy is significantly higher than that of @GENE$ and @GENE$ on our IP - pk168 data set	1
12213	Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot - free structure is provided , so it is more robust than HFold	1
12214	Specifically , Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy on @GENE$ steadily increases from roughly 54 % to 79 % as the user provides up to 40 % of the input structure , and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided .	1

12224	( 2 ) The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods , namely , the 10 th five - year plan period ( 2003 ) ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) , the 11 th five - year plan period ( 2005 ) ( 2006 ) ( 2007 ) ( 2008 ) ( 2009 ) ( 2010 ) , and the 12 th five - year plan period ( 2010 - 2013 )	1

12227	( 4 ) The affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment , while the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector	1

12240	Cells were detached using @GENE$ ( Sigma ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen with 40 % FBS and 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ; Sigma ) in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium containing Glutamax and without phenol red ( DMEM ; Gibco , Thermo Fisher ) at 2	1

12244	After 24 h , the insert medium was replaced , and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days	1
12245	After reaching confluence , the cells were shifted to ALI by removing the medium in the upper chamber , and in the basal chamber BEGM was replaced with ALI medium ( 1 : 1 [ vol / vol ] LHC basal medium plus DMEM , supplemented as BEGM with 1 ng / ml of EGF ; Thermo Fisher )	1
12246	Experiments were performed as soon as movement of cilia was visible , indicating full differentiation of cultures .	1
12247	We also assessed the phylogenetic position of our vampire bat Bartonella sequences among known Bartonella genotypes ( Fig 3 , S3 Table )	1
12248	Half of our Peruvian and Belizian sequences ( 18 / 35 ) were nearly identical ( > 99	1

12250	g	1
12251	, GenBank accession numbers KY629837 and MF467803 ) , again confirming the wide geographic distribution of these genotypes	1
12252	Other sequences ( 9 / 35 ) fell within the same clade ( > 96 % pairwise identity ) as Bartonella from bat flies ( Strebla diaemi ) in Panama ( JX416251 ) , from @DISEASE$ bat ( Pteronotus parnellii ) in Mexico ( e	1
12253	g	1
12254	, KY629828 ) , from phytophagous bats in Peru ( e	1

12257	g	1
12258	, Glossophaga soricina ; HM597202 ) , or from Mexican vampire bats as noted above	1
12259	Eight sequences were novel ( < 96 % identity to GenBank sequences ) but were most similar to Bartonella from phytophagous bats in Costa Rica ( e	1
12260	g	1
12261	, 90 - 93 % to KJ816666 [ Anoura geoffroyi ] ) and from Mexican vampire bats ( e	1

12264	Amomum tsao - ko Crevost & Lemairé is a zingiberaceous plant called ' Caoguo ' or ' Tsao - ko ' , which is widely distributed in the south - west of China	1
12265	As some reports have related cytotoxicity with antioxidant activity and the essential oil studied by the authors had substantial anticancer activity , [ 56 ] assayed the antioxidant activity of their samples using diverse methods , being one of them the TBARS method	1
12266	The lipidic substrate was constituted by liposomes containing lecithin , and the induction of peroxidation was performed with ferrous sulphate	1
12267	They found weak antioxidant activity , as expected by the authors , due to the low phenolic content of the oils	1
12268	The main component was 1 , 8 - cineole	1
12269	The absence of phenolic compounds related with weak antioxidant activity is not in accordance with those reported by [ 44 , 55 ] , which found potent and moderate activity with oils presenting furanodiene , germacrene D , furanodienone , curzerenone , and sabinene and limonene , respectively	1
12270	In spite of the different composition of the oils it is also important to stress that this difference of activities may also be attributed to the different lipidic substrate used in both works .	1
12271	The criteria for a positive test were OD 450 ≥ 0	1
12272	400 and at least four times greater than the OD 450 of the negative control [ 22 ]	1
12273	An OD 450 < 0	1
12274	300 with an OD 450 of the internal control > 2	1
12275	00 indicated a negative test	1
12276	A reading from 0	1
12277	300 to 0	1
12278	399 was interpreted as indeterminate and the sample examined again	1
12279	If the same result was obtained on repeated testing , the NPA was deemed negative	1
12280	If the OD 450 of the internal control for a given NPA was < 2	1
12281	00 and sample absorbance was < 0	1
12282	400 for all tested agents , the NPA was tested again	1
12283	If the same result was obtained on repeated testing , the interpretation was indeterminate due to potential inhibition , and the case not included in the analyses .	1
12284	where D ( x , t ) is the intake fraction of the susceptible passenger , which is defined in Eq	1
12285	( 1 ) and used in Eq	1
12286	( 2 ) ; D q ( x , t ) is the intake fraction of the susceptible passenger for the qth movement behavior ; and a q is the possibility of the qth movement behavior ; X q a q ¼ 1 .	1
12287	By using the risk assessment , the influence of human movement on infectious disease transmission can be analyzed and compared	1
12288	According to Eq	1
12289	( 2 ) , the infection risk of each passenger after the 3 - hour flight can be calculated for case 1 ~ 3	1
12290	For case 2 and 3 , the infection risk is calculated under the assumption that the moving person walks in the airplane frequently during the flight and he / she will walk through the aisle during each cough of the index patient	1
12291	Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate the average infection risk per passenger in the airplane cabin for case 1 ~ 3	1
12292	Figure 8 is the average of the infection risk of the six passengers seated in the same row ( row 1 ~ 12 ) , and Figure 9 is the average of the twelve passengers seated in the same line of seats ( seat A ~ F )	1
12293	In Figures 8 and 9 , the calculated infection risk of the index patient is excluded since he is already infected	1
12294	As shown in Figure 8 , the infection risks of the passengers close to the index patient ( row 8 - 10 ) are much higher than others	1
12295	Further area has a lower infection risk , except for row 1 and 2 where the moving person stops	1
12296	From Figure 8 , it also can be seen that the average infection risk of each row is affected by human movement	1
12297	The movement of the standing person increases the average infection risk in @GENE$ 6 - 8 ( three rows in front of the index patient ) , row 9 ( the same row of the index patient ) , row 10 ( one row behind the index patient ) and row 1 ( where the moving person stops )	1
12298	For other areas , whether the movement can increase the infection risk depends on the moving speed	1
12299	As shown in Figure 9 , the average infection risk of the passengers in seat B ~ D will increase after human movement	1
12300	The average infection risk of the passengers in seat A will also increase when the moving speed is 0	1
12301	5 m / s	1
12302	This result indicates that human movement may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and lead to increases in the infection risks of more than half of the passengers .	1
12303	The crystal structure of @GENE$ ( Figure 1B ) reveals an overall ellipsoidal structure consisting of six [UNK] - helices and seven [UNK] - strands with two major domains , a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and a @GENE$ ( 32 )	1
12304	Within the latter domain , we previously identified a @GENE$ 123 GKYLQRRLQ 131 ( 19 ) as a potential @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) that forms one of three @GENE$ in the region between the @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; Ref	1

12309	, ( 19 ) ) and the expressed variants tested in RRL ( Figure 1D )	1
12310	In this experiment , the protease - defective variant retained full activity , ruling out the involvement of the @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ in the stimulation of @GENE$	1
12311	In contrast , the @GENE$ mutation prevented frameshifting , supporting a role for RNA binding by @GENE$ .	1
12312	In light of the profound influence of globalization , international human travel , climate change , and urbanization on the spread of the @DISEASE$ , some of the literature has called for research that assesses the feasibility of a more global response to preventing spread	1
12313	Table 4 summarizes the literature included in the review of @DISEASE$ in Liberia	1
12314	Liberia was the focus for the purposes of this systematic review because of its high prevalence of @DISEASE$ in comparison to other affected areas	1
12315	Similar to @DISEASE$ , the reviewed literature spoke to all of the themes identified in the politics of epidemics literature ( socioeconomic distribution of disease and the attribution of @DISEASE$ responsibility ) , with the exception of decision - making in research and development .	1
12316	According to the literature , @DISEASE$ quickly became a profoundly racialized disease and inflamed racial tensions in the Greater Toronto Area ultimately leading to the social exclusion of a racial minority - the Asian - Canadian group ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
12317	Such avoidance and stigmatization is reported to have played out in several spaces , such as on public transit and other public spaces , and families advising children to avoid Chinese peers in school ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
12318	Some of the literature posits that this racialized stereotyping could have been prevented with denunciation from leaders in government and public health ( Jacobs 2007 )	1
12319	On the other hand , according to Ali ( 2008 ) , individualized health behaviors aimed at preventing @DISEASE$ contraction - for instance , wearing a face mask - may have justified the avoidance of the stigmatized of the Asian - Canadians ( Ali 2008 )	1
12320	Culture and ethnicity functioned not only as a risk factor for discrimination but also as a facilitator in the response to the outbreak	1
12321	The Chinese - Canadian community in Toronto employed numerous strategies to combat @DISEASE$ and ease social anxieties , including fundraising for research , the dissemination of health promotion materials , and launching a @DISEASE$ support line , among other activities ( Dong 2008 )	1
12322	The mobilization of spiritual leaders was also found to be an effective means of disseminating public health information ( Faust et al	1
12323	2009 )	1
12324	While it is important to recognize the contributions of cultural and ethnic groups , we assert that cultural and ethnic minority groups are more often targets of blame , as was the case for @DISEASE$ in Toronto	1
12325	Table 3 summarizes the total number of hits , and the number of papers that were retrieved and reviewed	1
12326	The reviewed literature spoke to all of the themes identified in the politics of epidemics literature ( socioeconomic distribution of disease , credibility of evidence , and the attribution of @DISEASE$ responsibility ) , with the exception of decision - making in research and development .	1
12327	To date , as opposed to @DISEASE$ viruses [ 54 ] , @DISEASE$ viruses have never been isolated from the internal content of eggs [ 55 ]	1
12328	Given the high tropism of this virus for the oviduct , further analyses will clarify the role of eggs and egg products in the transmission of H9N2 viruses in poultry and the potential threat posed by their consumption in humans .	1
12329	Results : In this study , we describe an additional mechanism through which @GENE$ block HIV - 1	1
12330	In virus - producing cells , @GENE$ coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles	1
12331	Expression of @GENE$ during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells	1
12332	This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of @GENE$ present on retroviral particles .	1
12333	In order to describe the association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , different outcome indicators were considered : outcomes at the level of each month [ " any @DISEASE$ " , " any @DISEASE$ " ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) , " any @DISEASE$ " ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) , " ≥ 3 @DISEASE$ " , " any long lasting infection " ( > 2 weeks ) ] ; at the level of each winter season ( " ≥ 4 months with infections " , " ≥ 3 long lasting infections " ) ; and at the individual level ( i	1
12334	e	1
12335	are defined once per individual and covering the overall study period )	1
12336	The ten specific @DISEASE$ symptom categories were considered with the binary symptom indicators " infection reported " or " no infection reported " for each month .	1
12337	We were also able to analyse sequence data from a contemporaneous @DISEASE$ outbreak in the UAE in 2018	1
12338	This is the first study to characterise full - l@GENE$ h VP2 sequences from the Middle East	1
12339	Viruses most closely related to the UAE viruses , which formed a phylogenetically distinct lineage , were from a range of locations in Europe , Asia and the Americas , but the long lineage leading to the UAE viruses suggests that we have not yet sampled their ultimate ancestor .	1

12350	A member of the @DISEASE$ genus , @DISEASE$ is an enveloped , single - stranded positive sense RNA virus that cycles between birds and mosquitos	1
12351	Symptoms of @DISEASE$ infection can range from a relatively mild @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , to severe @DISEASE$	1
12352	After peripheral infection , WNV replicates within lymphoid tissues before entering the CNS , where it targets neurons in the cerebellum , brainstem , and cerebral cortex [ 2 , 3 ]	1
12353	In 2017 , 2002 symptomatic @DISEASE$ cases were reported to the CDC , and of those , 1339 ( 67 % ) were classified as neuroinvasive [ 4 ]	1
12354	Prolonged neurological deficits , which include motor functions , verbal learning and memory , and executive functions , are a significant problem for survivors of @DISEASE$ and appear to manifest even in cases where neuroinvasion is absent [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] .	1

12375	H1N1 has had an interesting history	1
12376	Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957 , when the human strain went extinct	1
12377	In 1977 , a version identical to those circulating in NE Europe in the early 1950s reappeared in Anshan , China and subsequently spread across the world [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]	1
12378	In 2009 , a swine H1N1 jumped to the human population , causing a widespread pandemic	1
12379	This has increased concern that H1N1 might mutate into a more virulent form	1
12380	However , since the pandemic of 1917 , this has not happened	1
12381	In fact , @GENE$ - related human mortality has declined very dramatically and very systematically [ 2 ]	1
12382	Apart from the 1917 pandemic , H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic , and human H1N1 essentially went extinct from 1957 - 1977	1
12383	Since its re - introduction , it has remained a relatively minor cause of @DISEASE$ mortality [ 2 ]	1
12384	This applies also to the 2009 outbreak , which caused relatively few deaths in those areas with good reporting systems in place [ 8 ] .	1
12385	Overall , participants reported that guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship policies were better established in public - sector hospitals and clinics than their private counterparts	1
12386	Participants attributed this to strict adherence to the guidelines in the public sector , as well as regular audits and monitoring of antibiotic prescriptions by public - sector pharmacists	1
12387	The following quote is an example of the audits conducted in the public sector :	1
12388	" At the treatment end , there ' s no problem because their treatment process is rigorous enough to remove all these bugs and all that	1

12400	@GENE$ factors of carbon emissions in residential sector were decomposed yearly first ( Table 6 ) and divided into 3 periods ( Fig 5 )	1
12401	Although the residential carbon emissions in Guangzhou accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total carbon emissions , it exhibited a rapid growth trend during the whole research period along with the improvement of urbanization level	1
12402	The total residential carbon emissions increased from 0	1
12403	55 million tons in 2003 accounting for 3	1
12404	61 % of the total carbon emissions to 2	1
12405	01 million tons accounting for 6	1
12406	59 % in 2013	1
12407	Furthermore , the residential carbon emission increments were mainly generated by the urban residents , which increased from 0	1
12408	The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model was always two times of the average income of rural residents during the same period	1
12409	The energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth , resulting in a 0	1
12410	26 million tons decrease , accounting for 34	1
12411	87 % of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value	1
12412	During the 12 th five - year plan period ( 2010 - 2013 ) , Guangzhou ' s residential carbon emissions increased by 0	1
12413	51 million tons	1
12414	The affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) and the carbon intensity effect of urban ( f - effect - Urban ) were the most two dominant positive driving factors on the carbon emissions increment , bringing in 0	1

12419	To our knowledge , ours is the first study to investigate transcytosis using virus coated with @GENE$ in an acidic environment that mimics that of the female genital tract	1
12420	Our in vitro observations are applicable to male - to - female transmission via vaginal intercourse , where enhanced transcytosis could facilitate infection	1
12421	In this regard , Li et al	1
12422	reported @GENE$ expression and bidirectional @GENE$ transport in a human vaginal tissue model [ 19 ]	1
12423	Although we did not detect @GENE$ in the apical layers of vaginal epithelium , we did detect abundant @GENE$ expression in columnar endocervical epithelial cells	1
12424	These cells may be exposed to acidic vaginal secretions where they occur at the cervical os	1
12425	Furthermore , @DISEASE$ , a common condition characterized by the extension of endocervical columnar epithelium into the ectocervix and upper vagina , has been implicated as a risk factor for @DISEASE$ [ 44 , 45 ]	1
12426	Prevalent in reproductive - age women , these @DISEASE$ are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for FcRn - mediated male @GENE$ - female @DISEASE$ 1 transmission [ 46 ]	1
12427	FcRn was also fou@GENE$ though not consistently , in basal epithelial cells of the vagina	1
12428	These cells lie deep in the epithelium and are unlikely to come in contact with acidic secretions and HIV - 1 immune co@GENE$  trauma or substantial thinning of the overlying squamous epithelium	1
12429	It is important to note that seminal fluid can rapidly raise the pH of cervicovaginal secretions to levels which would not support immune complex - @GENE$ Ho@GENE$  , the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range [ 29 ]	1
12430	Furthermore , HIV is present in preejaculate secretions and could be introduced into the female genital tract prior to ejaculation [ 47 ] .	1
12431	The soluble @GENE$ binding assay was performed as previously described with some modifications [ 70 ]	1
12432	Briefly , wells were coated with 250 ng of a @GENE$ ( D7324 [ Aalto Bioscience ] ) , washed and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk	1
12433	Serial dilutions of detergent - solubilized HIV - 1 JR - FL ( starting at 150 ng @GENE$ ) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 37uC	1
12434	Plates were then incubated with a constant concentration of @GENE$ ( 1 mg / mL ) for 1 hour at 37uC followed by detection and development steps as described above .	1

12437	For the quantification of viral titers a pooled sample of five workers per sampling week was crushed in 100 µL TN buffer ( 100 mM Tris , 100 mM NaCl , pH 7	1
12438	6 ) with a 5 - mm metal bead in 2 - mL Eppendorf ® ( Basel , Switzerland ) tubes using a Retsch ® ( Haan , Germany ) MM 300 mixer mill for 1 min at the frequency 25 1 / s [ 57 ]	1
12439	Injected honeybee pupae extracted as well as positive controls using 200 µL TN buffer	1
12440	Fifty microliters of the homogenate was transferred to 1	1
12441	5 - mL Eppendorf ® tubes and the RNA extraction was done using a @GENE$ ® RNA II kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Oensingen , Switzerland ) following the manufacturer ' s recommendations	1
12442	In the final step , RNA was eluted in 30 µL of elution buffer and stored at − 80 • C [ 57 ]	1
12443	To monitor the efficiency of the RNA purification and @GENE$ synthesis , @DISEASE$ virus ( TMV , 1 µL TMV solution ( 1 : 1000 ) ) was used as an exogenous internal reference added to each sample at the first step of the RNA extraction [ 58 ] .	1
12444	We note that sometimes non - specific amplification can also take place , especially where the @GENE$ is absent ( see Figure 3 ) and there is low amounts of DNA present in the reaction ( cf Figures 3a and 4 )	1
12445	These do not form the specific banding patterns representing the different @GENE$ that are characteristic for each assay and thus can be easily distinguished on a gel	1
12446	Alternative banding patterns have been observed , also for low template reactions ; analyses of these products show that they are formed by interactions of the primers used [ 8 ] , to form @GENE$ equivalents of primer - dimers	1
12447	Two factors seem to be important : in the absence of target , low background DNA may aid the formation of non - specific products that go on to be amplified ; and freeze - thaw repetitions may induce damage to the primers to permit the formation of ' primer intermediates ' which can then be amplified	1
12448	Since @GENE$ is capable of non - specific amplification , techniques that rely on the detection of by - products of DNA synthesis , e	1

12453	The sensitivity of the @GENE$ assay and its suitability for practical GMO detection was tested using assays for commonly - used @GENE$ , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and the @GENE$ for the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ , respectively )	1
12454	These sequences are commonly used in constructs used to create approved GM events ( see [ 11 ] )	1
12455	@GENE$ contains both @GENE$ and @GENE$ so provided convenient template for testing the assays	1
12456	We used a sample where the copy number of the GM has been well characterized and thus control the number of template in each reaction .	1

12469	Need to Address the Prevention of @DISEASE$ outside the Human Health Sector Many participants also expressed that @DISEASE$ in Singapore had so far only been addressed in the hospital sector and not much had been done regarding the prevention of @DISEASE$ in the animal and environment health domains	1
12470	It was also ment@GENE$ d that within NAT most of its members and emphasis was still focused on the hospital sector :	1
12471	Research effort on bats is heavily biased geographically , in particular the United States , countries of Western Europe , China , Japan , India , Australia , and Brazil had the greatest number of published bat - related studies indexed on PubMed ( Figure 3 )	1
12472	Not surprisingly , overall bat research per country was positively correlated with bat species richness ( r = 0	1
12473	45 , p < 0	1
12474	001 ) ( Table S3 ) , however many areas of central Africa and Southeast Asia with high species richness had a very low overall number of publications on bats	1
12475	Globally , nearly half of all countries had less than five bat - related publications indexed in PubMed ( 42 % , see Table S4 )	1
12476	Western Asia , together with much of Africa , had some of the lowest numbers of bat - related publications , with a few exceptions	1
12477	While half of all Western Asian countries have 10 or fewer publications on bats , a few countries reported relatively high publication counts , specifically Turkey and Israel ( 110 and 533 publications , respectively ) .	1
12478	Fragment analysis was performed on a GenomeLab @GENE$ fragment analysis system ( Beckman Coulter Inc	1
12479	) 1µL of @GENE$ was dissolved in 39µL of sample loading solution and 400 bp DNA ladder was used as size reference	1
12480	The @GENE$ and @GENE$ along with @GENE$ were used as reaction control and sample control respectively	1
12481	If control bands were absent , the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors	1
12482	Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software .	1
12483	This study was carried out in accordance with the P & G Pet Care Animal Research Policy , and the protocol was approved by the P & G Pet Care Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee	1
12484	All cat owners provided written consent to participate in the study .	1
12485	To overcome the inactivity of @GENE$ and to define the inhibitory activity of different domains , we decided to create @GENE$ using domain swapping between @GENE$	1
12486	Particularly , the @GENE$ contains the @GENE$ from @GENE$ and the @GENE$ from @GENE$ , whereas the @GENE$ contains the @GENE$ from the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ from the @GENE$ ( Figure 5B )	1
12487	The breakpoint was designed to occur immediately after the @GENE$ at residue 106 and before the conserved Ser residue in both proteins at residue 107 ( Figure 5B ) .	1
12488	The median time from shelter admission to diagnosis of @DISEASE$ was 9 days	1
12489	The minimum holding time for unidentified cats in municipal shelters in the states of Victoria and NSW is 7 days , after which cats can be euthanised or rehomed ( Domestic Animals Act 1994 , Companion Animals Act 1998 )	1
12490	Changes in euthanasia practices resulting in longer length of stay ( LOS ) may have contributed to a cumulative increase in selection pressure for @DISEASE$ re - emergence , especially in shelters where vaccination was not practiced	1
12491	The likelihood of exposure to @DISEASE$ increases within a shelter environment with increasing LOS [ 39 ]	1
12492	National data from Royal Society of Prevention to Cruelty ( RSPCA ) shelters show a progressive decline in euthanasia rates from 74 % in 1995 to 27 % in 2018 [ 40 , 41 ]	1
12493	Similar declines in euthanasia have occurred in shelters in other countries such as Canada [ 42 ] .	1
12494	A total of 48 @GENE$ ere used in this study ( Table 1 )	1
12495	The serial number ( SN ) , genotype , length value , isolated region , GenBank accession numbers , and other detail information about these strains were listed in Table 1	1

12501	The other sequences with > 98 % sequence identities were excluded .	1
12502	The six amino acids were soaked into pAPN crystals to determine the structures of the @GENE$	1
12503	The structure of the unliganded @GENE$ was used to determine the structures of amino acid - soaked @GENE$	1
12504	Objective Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of amino acids and showed strong electron density for each of the amino acids ( Supplemental Figure 4 )	1
12505	Based on these maps , the models of amino acids were built , and the models of @GENE$ were further refined	1
12506	Crystallographic statistics can be found in Supplemental Figure 5 .	1
12507	Study participants were recruited from the district of Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu Valley , Nepal	1
12508	A total of 1 , 913 ( 86	1
12509	2 % ) of the 2 , 219 cases were recruited from within Bhaktapur municipality , a semi - urban agricultural based town with a population of approximately 80 , 000 , of which we at any time had approximately 4 , 500 children 2 to 35 months of age under surveillance for @DISEASE$	1
12510	Low income , low dietary intakes and low consumption of dairy and animal products are widespread , as in most parts of Nepal	1
12511	@DISEASE$ , mainly manifested as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , are common among children less than 5 years of age [ 17 ] .	1
12512	@GENE$ have been developed but they are limited only to the targeted virus and are often susceptible to antigenic drift	1
12513	Here , we present an alternative strategy for creating virus - resistant cells and animals by ectopic expression of a nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which has both @GENE$ and @GENE$ activities	1
12514	HeLa cells ( SCH7072 ) expressing @GENE$ acquired significant resistance to DNA viruses	1
12515	Virus challenging with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in 3D8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of 3D8 s@GENE$ addition , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) infection in WT C57BL / 6 mice was lethal , whereas transgenic mice ( STG90 ) that expressed high levels of 3D8 scFv@GENE$  , muscle , and brain showed a 56 % survival rate 5 days after @DISEASE$ intramuscular infection	1
12516	The antiviral effects against DNA viruses conferred by 3D@GENE$ pression in HeLa cells as well as an in vivo mouse system can be attributed to the nu@GENE$ tivity that inhibits viral genome DNA replication in the nucleus and / or viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm	1
12517	Our results demonstrate that the nucleic - acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D@GENE$ nfers viral resistance to DNA viruses in vitro in HeLa cells and in an in vivo mouse system .	1
12518	Health effects of indoor air exposures can be decreased by increasing ventilation and the present modelling shows that controlling indoor air sources plays a major role when selecting appropriate ventilation rate	1
12519	In a case where indoor sources cannot be removed or their emissions cannot be limited to an accepted level , ventilation needs to be increased to remove remaining pollutants	1
12520	In these cases outdoor air pollution become the major source of pollution in indoors , and it needs to be taken into account .	1
12521	where f is the fraction of population exposed to a given factor and RR is the relative risk of the exposed population	1
12522	Now if the background burden of disease ( BoD ) is known the environmental burden of disease ( @DISEASE$ ) caused by the current exposures ( Table 3	1

12526	Decreased @DISEASE$ A combination of phages is needed F4 in experimental @DISEASE$ [ 130 ]	1
12527	In addition , it was shown that the feeding of pigs with live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhanced their growth and reduced the duration and the severity of @DISEASE$ caused by ETEC [ 131 ]	1
12528	It has been demonstrated that the administration of a mixture of two probiotics , Pediococcus acidilactici and Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii , in the feed of challenged weaned pigs reduced ETEC : F4 attachment to the ileal mucosa in comparison with the group treated with chlortetracycline and tiamulin [ 103 ]	1
12529	Synbiotics refers to a combination of probiotic and prebiotic approaches ; it is possible that a prebiotic that confers gastrointestinal health benefits could selectively increase the population and / or activity of probiotics in the gut [ 132 ]	1
12530	Synbiotics can be either complementary or synergistic	1
12531	Complementary synbiotics consist of a probiotic and a prebiotic selected independently to confer benefits to the host	1
12532	On the other hand , synergistic synbiotics are comprised of a prebiotic chosen specifically for the selected probiotic to potentiate its effect in the gut [ 133 ]	1
12533	It was shown that the combination of raw potato starch and a probiotic had a beneficial effect on pig growth performance and resulted in a reduction of @DISEASE$ and increased microbial diversity in the gut of weaned pigs challenged with an ETEC : F4 strain [ 134 ]	1
12534	Also , Guerra - Ordaz et al	1
12535	[ 135 ] showed that following a challenge of pigs with pathogenic E	1
12536	coli ( O149 : K91 : H10 ) , administration of a prebiotic oligosaccharide , lactulose , in the feed resulted in improved weight gain , increased lactobacilli and the proportion of butyric acid in the colon , and less inflammation due to a red@GENE$ ph@GENE$ n ( Pig - MAP ) in serum	1
12537	Administration of Lactobacillus plantarum in the feed promoted lactobacilli growth , modulated fermentative activity , reduced inflammation , and improved intestinal mucosa function and showed a tendency to reduce @DISEASE$	1
12538	The application of a synbiotic diet resulted in the benefits of both diet regimes , thus being an example of a complementary synbiotic [ 135 ] .	1
12539	To determine the substrate specificity of @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was profiled using an unbiased and global substrate profiling approach referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry ( MSP - MS ) 16	1
12540	The MSP - MS assay uses a 228 - member library of 14 - mer synthetic and unmodified peptide substrates that were rationally designed to maximize physicochemical diversity within a small sequence space 17	1
12541	For specificity determination , @GENE$ was incubated with the MSP - MS peptide library and time - dependent peptide cleavage products were identified with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS )	1
12542	Statistical analysis that considers both cleaved and uncleaved positions in the peptide library 18 was subsequently performed to construct an iceLogo representation of hAPN @GENE$ ′ specificity as well as a corresponding heat map based on comprehensive Z - scores for each position ( Fig	1
12543	1A , B , and Supplemental Figure 1 ) .	1
12544	Cell culture assays consistently showed that @GENE$ readily entered infected cells and could specifically and strongly inhibit viral replication	1
12545	Fluorescein - labeled @GENE$ accumulated in the nucleus but were present throughout the cells [ 66 , 79 ]	1
12546	Lai et al	1
12547	[ 79 ] reported punctuate foci of signal in the cell cytoplasm which might be indicative of endosomal entrapment of @GENE$ .	1
12548	Passive transfer of anti - ZIKV immune sera protects mice against @DISEASE$ Next , we tested whether transfer of immune sera from ZIKV - prME vaccinated RM could prevent ZIKV - mediated pathogenesis in IFNAR − / − mice	1
12549	To this end , 150 μg equivalent IgG (@GENE$ T 50 ≈ 1 / 160 ) from week 6 RM were adoptively transferred into IFNAR − / − mice 1 day after the @DISEASE$ viral challenge	1
12550	Two groups of control mice were included , one group receiving pre - immune sera from RM and the other group receiving phosphate - buffered saline Figure 6	1
12551	Single immunisation with the ZIKV - prME vaccine provides protection against @DISEASE$ challenge in mice lacking@GENE$ ptor	1
12552	Mice were immunised once and challenged with 2 × 10 6 plaque - forming units of ZIKV - PR209 , two weeks post immunisation	1
12553	The survival curves depict 10 mice per group per experiment ( a )	1
12554	The ZIKV - prME vaccine prevented @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ in the mouse brain ( b )	1
12555	Brain sections from pVax1 and ZIKV - prME vaccinated groups were collected 7 - 8 days after challenge and stained with H & E ( haematoxylin and eosin ) for histology	1
12556	The sections taken from representative , unprotected pVax1 control animals shows pathology	1
12557	( i ) : nuclear fragments within neuropils of the cerebral cortex ( inset shows higher magnification and arrows to highlight nuclear fragments ) ; ( ii ) : perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex , lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells ; ( iii ) : perivascular cuffing , cellular degeneration and nuclear fragments within the cerebral cortex ; and ( iv ) : degenerating neurons within the hippocampus ( arrows )	1
12558	An example of normal tissue from ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice appeared to be within normal limits ( v and vi )	1
12559	( PBS )	1
12560	The mice that received PBS or control sera lost 15 to 25 % of their original body weight during the course of infection , and all died 6 - 8 days post infection	1
12561	When vaccine immune sera from RMs were transferred to infection - susceptible mice , the animals lost weight on day 3 and 4 , but subsequently regained it beginning on day 5 and 80 % ultimately survived infectious challenge ( Figure 7a ) demonstrating the ability of the NHP sera transfer to confer protection against clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection following viral challenge ( Figure 7b )	1
12562	In repeated experiments performed to evaluate the efficacy of immune serum transfer in protection against challenge with ZIKV , the survival among ZIKV - prME immune sera recipients ranged from 80 to 100 %	1
12563	These studies show that anti - ZIKV vaccine immune sera had the ability to confer significant protection against ZIKV infection in the absence of an acquired adaptive anti - ZIKV immune response .	1
12564	Results : 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months , without @DISEASE$ were evaluated	1
12565	Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48 , 5 % of patients	1

12598	Effect modification by sports activity and nutrition patterns was explored among those representing the lower and upper third of respective scores .	1
12599	CrFK and fcwf - 4 grown to confluency in 12 - well plates were stimulated with 600 μL of PBMC supernatants produced as explained above	1

12604	SDS - PAGE separation and submersed immunoblotting procedures were carried out as previously described [ 61 ]	1
12605	The Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder ( Fermentas GmbH , St	1
12606	Leon - Rot , Germany ) served as molecular weight standard marker for each blot	1
12607	For protein visualization , membranes were first cut immediately below the 80kB marker band	1
12608	The top and bottom membrane fractions were incubated with @GENE$ ( generously provided by Dr J	1
12609	Pavlovic , Institute for Virology , University of Zürich , Switzerland ) and @GENE$ as a loading control ( Sigma Aldrich GMbH , Buchs , Switzerland ) respectively	1
12610	Both fractions were subsequently incubated with a @GENE$ ( Jackson Immunoresearch , Newmarket , Suffolk , UK )	1
12611	Bands were digitalized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System ( Syngene , Cambridge , UK )	1
12612	With the exception of assays carried out with FPV , viral inhibition experiments were conducted simultaneously and with supernatants thawed an equal number of times	1
12613	The treated cells were then inoculated with virus ( VSV , FCV , FHV , FCoV ) or trypsinized with 0	1
12614	05 % @GENE$ - EDTA ( Gibco ® , Invitrogen ) and allowed to settle in viral suspension ( FPV ) , and inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h ( 72 h for FCoV and FPV ) according to the procedure described previously [ 62 ]	1
12615	Briefly , supernatants were discarded and cell debris was removed from the wells by 3 cycles of washing with Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) ( Gibco , Invitrogen ) and shaking on an orbital shaker for 15 s	1
12616	Remaining cells were fixed with 5 % formalin and stained with a crystal violet solution	1
12617	For spectrophotometric measurements , 100 % methanol was added to the dried out wells and absorbance was read at 595 nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microtiter plate reader ( Molecular Devices , Bucher Biotec AG , Basel , Switzerland )	1
12618	Viral inhibition rates were calculated with the following formula :	1

12621	Carvacrol was the major component of the essential oil	1
12622	This oil presented antioxidant activity , but inferior to that of the reference substance used by the authors ( BHT )	1
12623	In spite of the high percentage of carvacrol present in the oil , the inhibition percentage only reached 65 % , in contrast to the 100 % of BHT .	1
12624	The β - carotene bleaching method ( coupled oxidation of β - carotene and linoleic acid ) estimates the relative ability of antioxidant compounds in plant extracts to scavenge the radical of linoleic acid peroxide that oxidizes β - carotene in the emulsion phase	1
12625	β - carotene in the absence of the antixodant undergoes a rapid decolourization since the free linoleic acid radical attacks the β - carotene , which loses the double bonds and , consequently , its orange colour .	1
12626	There are very limited data on children with @DISEASE$ in Mali	1
12627	The objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with @DISEASE$ in hospitalized children < 5 years of age in Mali .	1
12628	What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens ? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread , but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors , such as human mobility and demography	1
12629	Here , we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human @DISEASE$ dynamics	1
12630	We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration , whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales	1
12631	We demonstrate the power of our inter - disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of @DISEASE$ in 2009	1
12632	Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of @DISEASE$ .	1
12633	We collected blood at a 1 : 1 ratio with Alsever ' s solution to prevent coagulation and clarified 50 mL by centrifugation at 2000 g for 30 min , at 4 ° C to collect pelleted blood cells	1
12634	Subsequently , we centrifuged the supernatant at 27 000 g for 2 h at 4 ° C , and irrespective of the presence of a visible pellet , the bottom of the tube was washed with 1 mL of PBS , and the collected fluid was stored at − 80 ° C .	1
12635	The nasal swabs in STGG media were enriched for 4 hours in Todd Hewitt media supplemented with 20 % rabbit serum	1
12636	The bacterial pathogens were then isolated using selective media including MacConkey Agar , Blood Agar with Gentamicin , and Chocolate Agar	1
12637	After morphology - dependent selection , colonies were identified by specific tests where necessary such as , optochin sensitivity and bile solubility tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae , tests for requirement of growth factors @GENE$ for Haemophilus influenzae and appropriate biochemical tests including TSI ( Triple Sugar Iron ) , Citrate , MIU ( Motility Indole Urea ) media , and Analytical Profiling Index API 1 20E ( bioMérieux , St	1

12639	Profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility / resistance was performed by the modified disc diffusion method and the bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of inhibition zone interpretative chart , published in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute ( CLSI ) guidelines 2014 .	1
12640	Gene network analysis effectively identifies markers expressed in the pulmonary myocardium from wholelung transcriptome data To confirm that our analyses have , in fact , identified @GENE$ expressed in the pulmonary myocardium , lung tissue samples were analyzed from four BALB / c mice using immunohistochemistry to detect the cellular localization of @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
12641	@GENE$ was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set ( 12	1
12642	422 units ) and was part of n our @GENE$ ( Table S3 in File S2 )	1
12643	Further , @GENE$ has previously been shown to be a direct target of @GENE$ ( Chen et al	1
12644	1996 )	1
12645	To differentiate between the pulmonary myocardium and typical smooth muscle , we also examined the localization of @GENE$	1
12646	Cardiac ventricular tissue was used as a positive control for cardiomyocyte ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and smooth muscle ( @GENE$ ) immunostaining ( Figure S2 in File S1 )	1
12647	Distinct cell - type localization of @GENE$ and @GENE$ was observed in lung samples from four BALB / c mice ( Figure 4 ; representative image from one mouse shown )	1
12648	A thin muscle coat staining positively for @GENE$ was situated beneath the columnar epithelium ( Figure 4A , black filled arrow ) typical of bronchi and bronchioles in BALB / c mice ( Rockx et al	1
12649	2007 )	1
12650	Consistent with previous reports describing the pulmonary vein myocardium ( Kracklauer et al	1
12651	2013 ; Mueller - Hoecker et al	1

12661	Briefly , after habituation for 10 min , the animals received 10 startle trials , 10 no - stimulus trials , and 40 PPI trials	1
12662	Each startle trial consisted of a single 120 dB white noise burst lasting 40 msec	1
12663	The PPI trials consisted of a prepulse ( 20 msec burst of white noise at 69 , 73 , 77 , or 81 dB intensity ) followed , 100 msec later , by the startle stimulus ( 120 dB , 40 msec white noise )	1
12664	The total session lasted 17 min	1
12665	The resulting movement of the animal in the startle chamber was measured for 100 msec after the startle stimulus onset ( sampling frequency 1 kHz ) , rectified , amplified , and input into a computer , which calculated the maximal response over the 100 - msec period	1
12666	The basal startle amplitude was determined as the mean amplitude of the 10 startle trials	1
12667	The PPI was calculated according to the following formula : 100 × [ 1 − ( PP × / P120 ) ] % , in which PPx was the mean of the 10 PPI trials ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , or @GENE$ ) and P120 was the basal @GENE$ amplitude .	1

12731	In this work , a review was done on the most recent publications concerning their antioxidant and anti - inflammatory activities	1
12732	At the same time a survey of the methods generally used for the evaluation of antioxidant activity and some of the mechanisms involved in the anti - inflammatory activities of essential oils are also reported .	1
12733	A sample was considered positive if two or three ( of three ) replicates amplified the target and there was no amplification in either of the NTC or the no - template batch extract	1

12739	Given the zoonotic potential of bat - associated Bartonella , understanding transmission within bats is critical for understanding how Bartonella persists in bat populations and for assessing spillover risks [ 22 , 23 ]	1
12740	Ectoparasites are frequently invoked as a transmission route [ 12 , 19 , 24 ] , in part because vector - borne transmission occurs in other taxa [ 25 , 26 ] and because Bartonella has been identified in bat flies and ticks [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]	1
12741	While some bat ticks can feed on humans [ 30 ] , the high host specificity of bat flies [ 31 , 32 ] could limit opportunities for crossspecies transmission through ectoparasites [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ]	1
12742	Transmission through close contact ( e	1
12743	g	1
12744	, biting ) could occur given detection of Bartonella in dog and cat saliva [ 34 , 35 ] as well as human infection following scratches from dogs and cats [ 36 ]	1
12745	Phylogenetic patterns of weak Bartonella host specificity in Neotropical bat communities could not only reflect transmission through close contacts between species in multi - species roosts , but could also stem from transmission through generalist vectors [ 15 , 24 , 37 ]	1
12746	Bartonella might also be transmitted through exposure to feces between bats and to humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [ 18 , 38 ] .	1

12758	5 % ) symptomatic cases of participants , whereas 35 cases remained undetected of any pathogens	1
12759	A community - based study conducted in Bangladesh could identify respiratory viral pathogens in only 66 % of @DISEASE$ cases and the detection rate was lower than the detection rate calculated for this study [ 10 ]	1
12760	However , the study did not consider bacterial pathogens	1
12761	On the other hand , the studies of @DISEASE$ among children of Zambia and Madagascar reported the detection rates of respiratory pathogens in 76	1
12762	8 % and 74	1
12763	6 % specimens , respectively , and these studies focused on the detection of both viral and atypical bacterial pathogens [ 20 , 21 ]	1
12764	A similar study conducted in China demonstrated 67	1
12765	5 % overall pathogen detection rate [ 22 ]	1
12766	These all suggest that our findings in terms of pathogen detection are consistent with the reported data of similar studies .	1
12767	Study participants were selected from contacts of @DISEASE$ patients based on a priority system in 4 regions strongly affected by the 2015 @DISEASE$ outbreak	1

12774	Supporting and promoting local scientists in assuming leadership positions and determining the direction of future research endeavors is critical for any successful regional network	1
12775	Racey [ 81 ] discusses a history of foreign - led bat research efforts in non - Western countries , where in many instances , neither permission nor consultation was requested from local researchers	1
12776	Regarding bat research in Western Asia , there are numerous ways in which foreign organizations can support existing regional institutions	1
12777	In - country field training , outreach development ( e	1
12778	g	1
12779	, scientific communication ) , and workshops that promote networking and idea exchange between experts and early career scientists including students , would provide local researchers with the skills and resources necessary to expand on - going research efforts [ 4 ]	1
12780	To this end , @GENE$ - Net aims to support local institutions by : ( 1 ) supporting in - region scientists in research topics that they identify as high - priority , ( 2 ) assisting young professionals and early career scientists in developing multidisciplinary research skills , ( 3 ) conducting all screening of diagnostic samples in regional laboratories to strengthen regional surveillance capacity ( currently including the Royal Scientific Society in Amman , Jordan and the R	1

12782	Participants reflected on the need to develop public campaigns to sensitize people to become aware of and understand the fundamentals of programs and strategies against @DISEASE$	1
12783	These include stewardship , adherence to vaccination guidelines , better infection prevention and control practices in hospitals as well as programs in the community	1
12784	All these programs needed to take into account social , behavioral , and cultural aspects to accommodate the needs and perceptions of the community	1

12789	During the 10 th five - year plan period ( 2003 ) ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) , Guangzhou announced the overall objective in the 10 th five - year plan that it would take the lead in realizing socialist modernization and building the modernization central city over China	1

12803	The initial goals of the WAB - Net research program include : identify the link between host and viral diversity , and if host - specific traits predict viral strain diversity ; characterize the influence of environmental degradation and bat - human interactions on viral prevalence in disturbed bat populations ; compare and contrast the structure and composition of CoV communities across species distributions ; and assess virus - host evolutionary relationships between bats and CoVs	1
12804	While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen , we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host - pathogen dynamics [ 148 ]	1
12805	Community ecology , with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities , allows one to understand @DISEASE$ disease dynamics in multi - pathogen , multi - host disease systems that occur across diverse scales ( e	1
12806	g	1
12807	, from within a single host , to between species , to between regions ) [ 148 ]	1
12808	Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include : effects of extreme weather ( e	1
12809	g	1
12810	, heat waves ) on bat survival , including changes in the distribution of bat species ( and associated pathogens ) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [ 149 , 150 ]	1
12811	For example , increased prevalence of @DISEASE$ ( MARV ) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition ( which resulted in an influx of immunologically - naive , juvenile bats ) , as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [ 77 ]	1
12812	If such virus - host associations exist in regional bat species , climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats , and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations	1
12813	A systems - wide , hypothesis - driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors , and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [ 146 , 148 ] .	1
12814	Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the @DISEASE$ outbreaks in Southeast and East Asian countries still remains elusive [ 5 , 9 ]	1
12815	Four hypotheses have been suggested for transmission of H5N1 in the @DISEASE$ outbreaks in Japan [ 6 ] : ( 1 ) H5N1 - virus - infected chickens may have been imported from other countries , ( 2 ) materials ( e	1
12816	g	1
12817	, vehicles and egg containers ) from infected area may have been used , ( 3 ) viruses may have been carried on clothes , boots , hands , and so forth , and ( 4 ) infected wild birds may have carried H5N1 virus into poultry farms to infect chickens	1
12818	In particular , it has been suggested that migratory birds carried the viruses and subsequently infected domestic and / or wild ducks [ 9 ]	1
12819	@DISEASE$ outbreaks in Japan	1
12820	Therefore , it is very likely that the 2004 epidemics H5N1 virus was transmitted to Japan from East Asian countries	1
12821	The important question is how could the H5N1 virus be transmitted from virus - positive migratory wild birds to domestic poultry in Japan ? We have noted that it is unlikely that wild birds directly transmitted @DISEASE$ to poultry in Japan , because all of the Japanese poultry farms , where @DISEASE$ outbreaks occurred , had fowling nets in place to prevent entry of wild birds	1
12822	However , flying insects ( e	1
12823	g	1
12824	, flies ) can easily get through the nets and invade a poultry farm	1
12825	We have shown that a chicken can eat all 31 blow flies put inside its cage in just 7 min [ 10 ]	1
12826	A chicken can catch and break down the body of a fly and even catch and swallow a fly in flight	1
12827	Therefore , we have been interested in whether , if a chicken eats blow flies carrying H5N1 virus , the chickens might become infected and develop symptoms of @DISEASE$ .	1
12828	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , Flaviviridae family , includes many pathogens causing severe human disease , ranging from mild @DISEASE$ to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
12829	There are more than 70 viruses in the genus flavivirus , and they are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes ( @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( YFV ) , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and ticks ( @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ ( LGTV ) , @DISEASE$ ( KFDV ) , @DISEASE$ ( OHFV ) , @DISEASE$ ( POWV ) , and @DISEASE$ ( LIV ) ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
12830	Among the @DISEASE$ , TBEV , POWV , and LIV are @DISEASE$ , whereas OHFV and @DISEASE$ are @DISEASE$ .	1
12831	In Germany , paediatric influenza vaccination for @DISEASE$ ( H1N1 ) pdm09 was recommended and funded for all children as monovalent vaccination from October 2009 to July 2010 [ 32 ]	1
12832	For @DISEASE$ , however , paediatric influenza vaccination was and is currently recommended only for specific risk groups with underlying @DISEASE$ [ 33 ]	1
12833	Vaccination uptake was low , even in this target group	1
12834	Pre - pandemic vaccination rates were 5 % for all children and about 15 % for children with chronic underlying conditions in 2007 / 2008 [ 34 ]	1
12835	For the pandemic and post - pandemic seasons , no data on vaccination rates is available for children , but vaccination rates as low as 14 % ( 2009 / 10 ) and 11 % ( 2010 / 11 ) were reported for adults , with a vaccination rate of only 17 % even for risk group adults [ 35 ]	1
12836	In our study , more than 75 % of influenzaassociated PICU patients were children with underlying chronic conditions	1
12837	Analysis of their reported @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] )	1
12838	Data are given in % , by age group and season	1
12839	Season 1 : Oct10 - Sep11 ( n = 18 ) , Season 3 : Oct12 - Sep13 ( n = 13 ) ; Season 2 : Oct11 - Sep12 ( n = 1 ) is not shown vaccination status showed that among these were a high proportion of vaccine - eligible but unvaccinated children	1
12840	Patients with @DISEASE$ too young to be vaccinated and other paediatric risk groups , such as otherwise healthy children below 2 years of age , are not covered by the current German recommendation	1
12841	All these groups could profit considerably from universal influenza vaccination for children , either directly or by herd protection	1
12842	In contrast to the situation in Germany , in the United States universal influenza vaccination for all children older than 6 months of age has been established , and vaccination coverage reached a level of approximately 41 % in 2013 [ 36 ]	1
12843	Compared to 348 influenza - associated paediatric deaths observed in the United States during the pandemic 2009 / 10 , only 79 were observed in the strong A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 season 2013 / 14 [ 37 ]	1
12844	This might partly be explained by increasing immunity in children after previous A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 infection , but may in part also be a result of the influenza vaccination program [ 37 ]	1
12845	In England , a universal childhood vaccination programme with a new live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) with intra - nasal application was started in the 2013 / 14 influenza season [ 38 ]	1
12846	First results showed an overall uptake of 53 % in primary school aged children , indicating a good acceptance of LAIV , and suggesting direct and indirect impacts on disease incidence , including reduction of paediatric influenza - associated hospitalisations .	1
12847	One possible explanation for the multiple independent FPV introductions described here is that FPV viruses circulating in the feral cat population may occasionally spill over into domestic cats	1
12848	In comparison to the owned cat population , estimated at 3	1
12849	8 million [ 26 ] , some 2	1
12850	1 to 6	1
12851	3 million feral cats ( free - roaming , unowned , unsocialised cats ) inhabit Australia [ 27 ]	1
12852	An @DISEASE$ seroprevalence of 79 % among feral cats in Victoria and NSW , documented in 1981 , provides evidence of widespread @DISEASE$ exposure [ 28 ]	1
12853	Viral introductions could also have been anthropogenic , for example through fomite spread during international travel .	1
12854	Bats harbor a myriad of viruses and some of these viruses may have spilled over to other species including humans	1
12855	Spillover events are rare and several factors must align to create the " perfect storm " that would ultimately lead to a spillover	1
12856	One of these factors is the increased shedding of virus by bats	1
12857	Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses	1
12858	Factors leading to an increase in the viral load of persistently infected bats would facilitate shedding of virus	1
12859	This article reviews the unique nature of bat immune defenses that regulate virus replication and the various molecular mechanisms that play a role in altering the balanced bat - virus relationship .	1

12867	@GENE$ protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus ( DE3 ) cells	1
12868	The transformed cells were cultured in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium containing 100 mg ml À1 ampicillin at 310 K	1
12869	The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0	1
12870	5 mM isopropyl - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( Pharmacia ) at an OD 600 of 0	1
12871	6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min	1
12872	The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7	1
12873	0 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM - mercaptoethanol ) and lysed by sonication , after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h	1
12874	The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal - affinity chromatography on nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid resin ( Peptron ) pre - equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7	1
12875	0 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole )	1
12876	The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer	1
12877	The @GENE$ bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7	1
12878	0 , 300 mM NaCl , 300 mM imidazole )	1
12879	The samples were then purified by size - exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 column ( GE Healthcare Life Science ) preequilibra with gel - filtration buffer ( 25 mM CHES - HCl pH 9	1
12880	5 , 200 mM NaCl ) , after which the fractions containing Cp - NanI CD protein were collected	1
12881	The protein was concentrated to 21	1
12882	8 mg ml À1 using an Amicon Ultra - 15 30K ( Millipore ) and was stored at 193 K .	1
12883	For T cell immune monitoring , we identified 101 individual synthetic peptides ( assigned as 1 to 101 ) in silico spanning the entire @GENE$ ( Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC / 2012 , GenBank accession no	1
12884	JX869059 )	1
12885	This peptide library was designed to contain 15 - mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa	1
12886	Eighty - four peptides could be synthesized ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and were organized into two - dimensional matrix peptide pools ( V1 to V9 and H1 to H9 ) containing 9 or 10 peptides as described previously [ 47 , 48 ]	1
12887	For further T cell epitope mapping , the 11 aa sequence shared between peptide # 89 and # 90 was trimmed into 8 - 10 - mer peptides , which were also obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific	1
12888	All peptides were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 2 mg / mL and stored at − 20 • C until use .	1
12889	EV71 - neutralizing monoclonal antibody @GENE$ was produced in ascetic fluid and purified as previously described [ 17 ]	1
12890	The specificity of @GENE$ was checked against E59 by western blot	1
12891	@GENE$ ( eBioscience , CA , USA ) was used as the control .	1
12892	SEED Servers : High - Performance Access to the SEED Genomes , Annotations , and Metabolic Models	1
12893	Data analysis include 44 samples sequenced using @GENE$ across 10 , 330 genome positions and 40 samples sequenced using Illumina across 10 , 379 @GENE$	1
12894	The minimum coverage cutoff was 506	1
12895	After quality filtering , the mean coverage for the sequencing data was 9806 for 454 data and 17 , 4486 for Illumina @GENE$ data , the median coverage was 7776 for 454 data and 15 , 7586 for Illumina @GENE$ data ( Fig	1
12896	S1 )	1
12897	In total , 10 , 451 positions of the @GENE$ me were sequenced by eith@GENE$ 54 @GENE$ na , of these , 10330 positions ( 98	1
12898	8 % of 10 , 451 loci ) were covered by both platforms , though not necessarily for all samples ; an additional 36 positions ( loci 5199 - 5206 , 5215 , 5216@GENE$ 63 ) were covered only @GENE$ 54 , and 85 positions@GENE$ 67 ) were covered only @GENE$ na , also not necessarily for all samples	1
12899	The few disagreements in consensus base calls betwe@GENE$ 54 a@GENE$ na were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely	1
12900	In most cases the disagreement was due to low coverage of t@GENE$ ci by one platform ( just above the 506 cutoff ) compared to coverage by the other platform (	1
12901	5006 )	1
12902	Hence the final consensus sequences of the two data sets contain no disagreement and can be considered accurate with high confidence .	1
12903	Due to its activity directed against @GENE$ , colistin is widely used for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 10 , 74 ]	1
12904	Two surveys conducted in pig farms in Belgium , in 2006 [ 73 ] , and 2012 [ 74 ] confirmed that colistin was the most frequently used antimicrobial for the control of @DISEASE$ , being mostly used prophylactically	1
12905	However , colistin was underdosed in 90 and 53 % of the cases , in the first and the second survey respectively	1
12906	In Germany , it was reported that @DISEASE$ in weaners were commonly treated with colistin , pigs being treated 9	1
12907	7 days ( median ) per 100 days with this antibiotic , although tetracycline and tylosin were also used in approximately equal amounts [ 75 ]	1
12908	In a study in France , it was reported that 90 % of pig farms used colistin during the post - weaning period [ 10 ]	1
12909	In Vietnam , a survey conducted on pig farms representing three different animal production systems ( farm household , semiindustrial and industrial ) showed that colistin was the most commonly used antimicrobial for prevention and therapy of @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 76 ] .	1

12912	In several countries , implementation of financial penalties for high antimicrobial users is proposed as a method to reduce antimicrobial usage and pig farmers would receive a financial bonus when they use alternative methods or when they greatly reduce antimicrobial use on their farms [ 94 ]	1
12913	Vaccination seems to be an effective approach to reduce the occurrence of @DISEASE$ and to reduce infection pressure and increase immunity in the pig population [ 2 ]	1
12914	Several studies conducted in pigs confirm a reduction of antimicrobial usage after vaccination [ 95 ]	1
12915	In fact , vaccination against the @DISEASE$ reduced the need for therapeutic oxytetracycline administration in Danish pigs [ 96 ]	1
12916	Live attenuated and wild type avirulent E	1
12917	coli vaccines appear to be promising for the control of @DISEASE$ and live vaccine against ETEC : F4 , is now available in Canada and Europe [ 97 ]	1
12918	This vaccine is added to the drinking water and recommended for the vaccination of healthy weaned pigs of 17 days or more	1
12919	Clinical studies confirmed that administration of this vaccine significantly reduced intestinal colonization by virulent ETEC : F4 and the accumulation of fluid in the intestines after an experimental challenge [ 98 ]	1
12920	The immunity in piglets begins 7 days after oral vaccination , however , since @DISEASE$ caused by ETEC : F4 occurs shortly , in the first week , after @GENE$ ng , an immune trough may exist in the first days after weaning during which the pigs are not protected [ 97 ]	1
12921	Thus , the time of the administration of this vaccine should be adjusted	1
12922	In addition , clinical trials of vaccination against ETEC : F18 has been carried out in pigs	1
12923	Genetically@GENE$ e pigs were vaccinated orally on three consecutive days , beginning 10 days before weaning with a live F18ac - positive E	1
12924	coli vaccine [ 53 ]	1
12925	In this study , a significant rise in F18ac - specific serum IgA and a 3 Log CFU decrease i@GENE$ ac - positive challenge strain was observed compared to the unvaccinated group	1
12926	However , this vaccine did not induce protective immunity against ETEC : F18	1
12927	On the other hand , it was shown that a minor subunit of F18 ( FedF ) alone or genetically fused to F4 FaeG su@GENE$ t @GENE$ njugated to F4 fimbriae induced @GENE$ tective anti - F18 antibodies in pigs [ 99 ]	1
12928	In general , the success of a vaccine against PWD depends largely on the identification of the most prevalent ETEC pathotype present in the farm , resulting in matching of the appropriate protective antigens with the adhesin produced by the ETEC present on the farm , and administering it at the optimal time [ 7 ]	1
12929	For vaccines consisting of live F4 or F18ac - positive E	1
12930	coli , it is often recommended to vaccinate suckling pigs to obtain a strong mucosal immunity production , IgA , before weaning	1
12931	However , our knowledge is very limited about the effect of maternal antibodies on the survival of these vaccine strains in the intestine of pigs of this age	1
12932	Also , there is no cross protection against ETEC strains expressing a different fimbria or toxin	1
12933	Recently , plantbased vaccines for protection of pigs against ETEC were investigated	1
12934	A rice - based cholera vaccine expressing the choleratoxin ( CT ) subunit B ( CTB ) ( MucoRice - CTB ) was tested in pigs for protection against LT - ETEC infection [ 100 ]	1
12935	CTB - based vaccines can target not only F4 - type but also F18 - type ETECs , and this vaccine also induced maternal CTB - specific IgG and IgA in the colostrum and milk of sows after farrowing	1
12936	CTB - specific antibodies were also secreted into the gut lumen of weaned pigs and reduced intestinal loop fluid accumulation upon ETEC challenge , indicating a protective effect of this vaccine against ETEC diarrhea [ 100 ]	1
12937	However , the cost of these vaccines is very high and , unlike open - air farming , the production of transgenic plants for biotherapeutic use is very demanding	1
12938	Moreover , the procedures for manufacturing and processing of plant - based pharmaceuticals are not well defined	1
12939	Thus , a large - scale production of these vaccines not envisaged , at least in the near future	1
12940	Current progress in the development of subunit vaccines against ETEC associated with diarrhea in humans and animals has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 97 , 101 ]	1
12941	However , none of these subunit vaccines has been marketed in swine .	1
12942	The @GENE$ ligated to the @GENE$ were a gift from Drs	1
12943	Michalik and Desvergne ( Center for Integrative Genomics , University of Lausanne , Lausanne , Switzerland ) and have been reported previously [ 17 ]	1
12944	The @GENE$ contains [UNK] 663 bp of the @GENE$ connected to the @GENE$	1
12945	Briefly , normal bronchial epithelial cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10 5 per well in 24 - well dishes and grown to 50 - 60 % confluence	1
12946	For each well , 0	1
12947	4 μg of the above @GENE$ , with or without 0	1
12948	5 μg of the internal control @GENE$ , were co - transfected into the cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent	1
12949	After 24 h of incubation , cells were treated with or without dmPGE 2 for 4 h	1
12950	The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of @GENE$ activities were carried out using the @GENE$ according to recommendations by the manufacturer ( Promega )	1
12951	The assays for firefly @GENE$ activity and @GENE$ activity were performed sequentially in a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer equipped with dual injectors	1
12952	Changes in firefly @GENE$ activity were calculated and plotted after normalization with changes in @GENE$ activity within the same sample .	1
12953	ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine induces antigen - specific T cells in C57BL / 6 mice The ability of the @GENE$ vaccine to induce cellular immune responses was evaluated	1
12954	Groups of four female C57BL / 6 mice were immunised with either the control @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) or the @GENE$ three times at 2 week intervals through intramuscular ( i	1
12955	m	1
12956	) injection followed by electroporation at the site of delivery ( Figure 2a )	1
12957	One week after the third injection bulk splenocytes harvested from each animal and evaluated in ELISpot assays for their ability to secrete @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) after ex vivo exposure to peptide pools encompassing @GENE$	1
12958	The assay results show that splenocytes from ZIKV - prME immunised mice produced a cellular immune response after stimulation with multiple ZIKV - E peptide pools ( Figure 2b )	1
12959	The region ( s ) of @GENE$ , which elicited the strongest cellular response ( s ) were evaluated by ELISpot assay in a matrix format using 22 peptide pools consisting of 15 - mers ( overlapping by 9 amino acids ) spanning the entire @GENE$	1
12960	Several pools demonstrated elevated T cell responses , with peptide pool 15 exhibiting the highest number of spot - forming units ( SFU ) ( Figure 2c )	1
12961	This matrix mapping analysis revealed a dominant @GENE$ , ' IRCIGVSNR DFVEGM ' ( aa167 - 181 )	1
12962	This peptide was confirmed to contain a @GENE$ through analysis utilising the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource tool ( http : / / tools	1
12963	iedb	1
12964	org ) , which [UNK] supports that in this haplotype the antigen is effectively processed .	1
12965	In contrast to @DISEASE$ in dogs , estimated to cause 20 , 000 cases per year in Australia , clinical cases of @DISEASE$ have rarely been diagnosed in Australia since the mid - 1970s , and there have been no reports of @DISEASE$ outbreaks for over 40 years [ 9 ]	1
12966	In 2014 , @DISEASE$ re - emerged in eastern Australia , and subsequent outbreaks occurred between 2015 and 2018 in several locations in this region	1
12967	Similarly , outbreaks of @DISEASE$ occurred in New Zealand ( NZ ) between 2016 and 2018 , as well as in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) in 2017 , with no outbreaks of @DISEASE$ reported in either country in recent decades , likely due to the widespread use of @DISEASE$ vaccines .	1
12968	Risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire	1
12969	This questionnaire was developed in Vietnamese and validated at HTD and consisted of four parts ; socio - demographic and cultural factors , medical history , potential exposure to pigs or pork and culinary habits and hygiene measures	1
12970	We hypothesized that consumption of ' ' high risk ' ' food dishes ( Table 2 ) , potentially contaminated with S	1
12971	suis , could function as a source of infection	1
12972	The majority of the questions were ' ' closed questions ' ' but ' ' open questions ' ' which allowed participants to explain in their own words were also included	1
12973	Patients and hospital controls were interviewed when they were fully conscious	1
12974	The questionnaire was filled in by structured interview , which was carried out by one of two research nurses on the ward for cases and hospital controls , or at the residency of community controls	1
12975	The interviewers were blinded towards the diagnosis of the patient in the case and hospital control groups .	1
12976	• The section describing the basis for the assumed source control levels ( page 11 ) can be improved .	1
12977	• The term " @GENE$ " is used throughout the paper and should be defined somewhere .	1
12978	While recent studies have focused on @DISEASE$ , less is known regarding dietary intervention with @DISEASE$	1
12979	@DISEASE$ is the primary clinical sign recognized in feline patients with @DISEASE$ ( 4 , 8 , 9 )	1
12980	In the Guilford ' s study , @DISEASE$ was present in 51	1
12981	4 % of the cats , @DISEASE$ in 31	1
12982	4 % , and @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in 17	1
12983	1 % ( 4 )	1

12985	4 % of total feline visits per annum presented with @DISEASE$ alone , 0	1
12986	4 % with @DISEASE$ alone , and 0	1
12987	1 % with both @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( 8 )	1
12988	An evaluation of 100 feline cases of @DISEASE$ suggested that diagnostic evaluation and implementation of dietary management is indicated in cats with @DISEASE$ as infrequently as two times per month ( 9 )	1
12989	While the use of elimination diets containing novel and hydrolyzed protein sources has been evaluated ( 4 , 5 ) , to the authors ' knowledge , no studies to date have evaluated the efficacy of feeding a nonspecific gastrointestinal therapeutic diet to cats with @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ included as one of the primary clinical signs .	1
12990	Here we applied this approach to test the efficacy of the 222 - nm far - UVC light to inactivate @DISEASE$ A virus ( H1N1 ) carried by aerosols in a benchtop aerosol UV irradiation chamber , which generated aerosol droplets of sizes similar to those generated by human coughing and breathing	1
12991	Aerosolized viruses flowing through the irradiation chamber were exposed to UVC emitting lamps placed in front of the chamber window .	1
12992	The apparent sustained fox - to - fox transmission in this outbreak suggests that CST occurred and enabled this epizootic	1
12993	We hypothesized that molecular changes in the @GENE$ would be associated with this event	1
12994	While phylogenetic data support that @DISEASE$ viruses have jumped species boundaries historically [ 5 ] , it is rare and has never been subject to comprehensive genetic analysis at the intra - host population level .	1
12995	Some of the authors that had evaluated the ability of essential oils to prevent lipid peroxidation by the TBARS method , also had evaluated the capacity for scavenging free radicals , using the DPPH assay [ 44 , 54 , [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] 56 , 57 ] .	1
12996	Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tri - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0	1
12997	1 % SDS ) containing protease inhibitor ( Halt protease inhibitor cocktail , Pierce )	1
12998	The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4 ° C	1
12999	Protein samples ( 10 μg ) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels ( 4 - 12 % )	1
13000	After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes , proteins were blotted using @GENE$ ( rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC ) , @GENE$ , @GENE$ [ 58 ] or @GENE$ followed by @GENE$	1
13001	After adding substrate , the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels	1
13002	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was used in immunoblots as a loading control .	1
13003	Malonaldehyde can also be measured through gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorous detector , after derivatization of malonaldehyde to 1 - methylpyrazole with N - methylhydrazine	1
13004	This method was followed by [ 43 ] that demonstrated the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus possessed the strongest activity , even comparable to that of α - tocopherol	1
13005	However , in the same work the authors also reported that at higher concentrations of thyme oil , such capacity decreased	1
13006	Basil oil , that was considered a good antioxidant when the activity was measured through the conjugated diene assay , did not stand out in this test , in which was only considered as possessing moderate activity	1
13007	Such results may reveal that basil is only able to prevent the primary oxidation of lipids .	1
13008	@GENE$ , ortholog of @GENE$ , has previously been shown to be responsible for degradation of @GENE$ via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway	1
13009	@GENE$ are responsible for ubiquitylation of @GENE$	1
13010	To determine whether degradation of @GENE$ via @GENE$ occurs by ubiquitylation , Culex cells were transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$ ( or @GENE$ as control )	1
13011	The cells were infected with @DISEASE$ and cell lysates collected 48 hours post - infection	1
13012	Immunoprecipitation was performed @GENE$ ibody , followed by Western blot @GENE$ uiti@GENE$ odies	1

13023	Due to the absence of studies on vaccines against @DISEASE$ in cats , the best strategy to prevent @DISEASE$ in this animal could be to use topical insecticides with application of chemical compounds with sand fly repellent activity , similar to those used for dogs	1
13024	Unfortunately , most pyrethroids , like permethrin and deltamethrin , cannot be used in cats due to their toxicity to this species	1
13025	The recent launch of a collar containing an additional compound belonging to this chemical class , flumethrin , that is well tolerated in the cat might represent a valid preventive option for the individual reduction of risk for infection of cats in highly endemic areas of @DISEASE$ , and for limiting the infectiousness of those that are already infected	1
13026	In fact , this collar was found useful in reduction of the incidence of @DISEASE$ in dogs [ 90 , 91 ] .	1
13027	These studies suggest that in bats of several species , higher level of @GENE$ and @GENE$ are always present in their cells , which makes them better prepared to control viruses	1
13028	Overall , bats seem to possess either an " always ON " @GENE$ strategy plus or a better antiviral @GENE$ defense strategy .	1

13030	What is the most effective specific treatment and the expected clinical response to treatment of FeL due to L	1
13031	infantum ?	1
13032	Here we introduce SNAD ( @GENE$ Annotation - based Designer ) that mediates automatic conversion of @GENE$ ( associated with multiple alignment or phylogenetic tree , or supplied as plain text list ) into biologically meaningful names and acronyms	1
13033	This conversion is directed by precompiled or user - defined templates that exploit wealth of annotation available in cognate entries of external databases	1
13034	Using examples , we demonstrate how this tool can be used to generate names for practical purposes , particularly in virology .	1
13035	Viral clearance is usually associated with @GENE$ and CD8 T - cell activity that is regulated by cytolytic or noncytolytic antiviral mechanism [ 14 ]	1
13036	To determine whether @GENE$ or CD8 T - cell activity was required for the reduction in @GENE$ levels in the livers of transgenic mice , we analyzed the @GENE$ levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice immunized with @GENE$ in the absence of @GENE$ or CD8 T cells ( Figure 4A )	1
13037	As expected , the mice lacking @GENE$ or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in @GENE$ levels ( Figure 4B ) .	1
13038	In the field , @DISEASE$ is often considered of multifactorial etiology and one of the most important causes of mortality in layers and breeders [ 36 ]	1
13039	Overfeeding , stress , genetics and improper lighting may all determine the occurrence of this syndrome , but in some cases , single factors such as @DISEASE$ ( e	1
13040	g	1
13041	@DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) can trigger the disease regardless of other managerial issues [ 37 ]	1
13042	If bacterial agents as E	1
13043	coli gain access to the peritoneum , either via reverse peristalsis along the oviduct or crossing of the intestinal barrier [ 38 ] , the @DISEASE$ becomes septic and more likely to bring the animal to a severe pathological state including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
13044	In light of this , and considering the good health status of birds at the end of the study , together with the @DISEASE$ and the altered architecture of the infundibulum , we speculate that the presence of yolk in the abdomen was the result of erratic oviposition [ 37 ] due to a chronic damage of the oviduct	1
13045	According to these evidences , the observed pathological picture could fall under the definition of @DISEASE$ .	1
13046	In this study , we modelled a G1 - lineage @DISEASE$ infection in commercial layers , in order to reproduce and investigate the long - term drop in egg production frequently observed in the field .	1
13047	The @GENE$ is coregulated from loci on @GENE$ and @GENE$ We next investigated whether transcripts within the @GENE$ were coregulated	1
13048	Pair - wise comparisons were performed using a matrix function	1
13049	All probe pairs within this set of 24 transcripts were positively correlated ( Figure S1 in File S1 )	1
13050	All pairs had a Pearson correlation	1
13051	0	1
13052	5 with the exception of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 0	1
13053	486 ) , and @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 0	1
13054	495 )	1
13055	Further , heat - map analysis of @GENE$ for all 24 transcripts highlighted prominent regions of shared covariance on @GENE$ and 2 with possible minor regions on @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( Figure 2A )	1
13056	This suggested that expression levels of multiple @GENE$ in this @GENE$ were coordinately regulated by a shared set of cis and @GENE$ .	1
13057	The transcription factors @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ potentially cooperate to specify and / or maintain pulmonary myocardium identity Since @GENE$ has previously been shown to be important for the maintenance of pulmonary myocardium cell identity , we investigated the possibility that genes within the pulmonary myocardium , and the candidate @GENE$ , might be direct targets of @GENE$	1
13058	To this end , we interrogated previously published @GENE$ ChIP - seq data derived from two sources	1
13059	He et al	1
13060	( 2011 ) used a doxycycline - inducible dual adenovirus system to express biotinylated @GENE$ in the HL1 cardiomyocyte cell line , while Dupays et al	1
13061	( 2015 ) examined endogenous @GENE$ binding in mouse hearts at embryonic day 11	1
13062	5 .	1
13063	According to the literature , it was possible to conclude that depending on the chemical compositon of the oils , they can act as anti - inflammatory affecting the arachidonic metabolism or the @GENE$ production , or on the modulation of pro - inflammatory gene expression .	1

13065	We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible , with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70	1

13067	In contrast , virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment , with an IC50 value of 293 µM , suggesting developing resistance to DFMO	1
13068	Following passage of virus , RNA was extracted , purified , reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced	1
13069	When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental @GENE$ , mutations in the two @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( Q29K ) and @GENE$ ( Q52R ) , were observed	1
13070	Interestingly , these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages	1
13071	Further , the 2A 29K and @GENE$ mutations were not observed in the same lineage	1
13072	Importantly , no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment .	1
13073	The proposal was submitted and presented to the School of Health Science and University Higher Degrees Committee ( UHDC ) and ethical clearance was granted ( SHS / 15 / PH / 07 / 1604 )	1
13074	Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the Limpopo Provincial Department of Health and Vhembe District Department of Health , Nursing Service Manager , and Chief Executive Officer of the regional hospital	1
13075	Consent forms were given to every participant to complete	1
13076	The nature of research was described to the participants of the study and they were informed of their right to refuse to participate , or to withdraw from participating if they felt that they could not continue	1
13077	The participants were also informed and assured that the information they provided would not be used against them or shared with other people but would be reported as findings of the study .	1
13078	Patients default on treatment for different reasons , such as no longer feeling sick , lack of knowledge , personal or cultural beliefs , lack of access to healthcare facilities , lack of motivation , and poor relationship with healthcare workers	1
13079	Non - adherence is one element that impacts negatively on the quality of nursing care	1
13080	Below are the comments made by the participants .	1
13081	A small number of epithelial , pneumocytes , lymphoid aggregates and inflammatory cells of submucosal glands were positive for @GENE$ in nonhuman primates ( NHPs )	1
13082	Whereas , @GENE$ were positive in epithelial layers of submucosal bronchial glands , lungs of NHPs and in some cells in BALTs [ 53 ]	1
13083	Dual Immunohistochemistry method was applied using @GENE$ against @GENE$ and @GENE$ , the staining showed that @GENE$ was found in @GENE$ positive cells but were negative in NHPs [ 53 ] .	1
13084	Follow - up revealed a healthy and thriving boy	1
13085	No @DISEASE$ was noted	1
13086	Echocardiography at 2 and 10 weeks after discharge were normal	1
13087	A review of the investigation results from the regional laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , with @DISEASE$ virus isolated from the patient ' s throat swab and @DIS@GENE$ Ig@GENE$ present in the serum	1
13088	Isolation of @DISEASE$ virus from the throat swab was performed using Vero / hSLAM cell lines	1
13089	Typical cytopathic effect was observed as formation of @DISEASE$ , which appeared as large multinucleated cells ( giant cells )	1
13090	The cultures were then harvested and the presence of @DISEASE$ virus confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay ( Chemicon International , Temecula , USA )@GENE$ es@GENE$ gM ) in the serum were detected by an indirect enzyme linked immuno - sorbent assay ( ELISA ) using a commercially available test kit ( Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH , Marburg , Germany ) .	1
13091	To evaluate the characteristic features of these CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , we analyzed @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ levels after poly ( I : C ) injection	1
13092	As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum @GENE$ levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly ( I : C ) injection ; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the @GENE$ treatment , which causes @DISEASE$ [ 11 ]	1
13093	After this peak , serum ALT@GENE$ els dropped continuously until day 4 , and then ALT levels began to increase , as did HCV@GENE$ els	1
13094	Thereafter , the HCV@GENE$  expressed consistently for at least 600 days .	1
13095	Protective Efficacy of @GENE$ Associated with a Reduction of Viral Load and @GENE$ in Human SCARB2 - Transgenic Mice	1
13096	@DISEASE$ has different patterns according to the children ' s age	1
13097	In the preschoolers ( 0 - 5 years old ) , @DISEASE$ is often induced by infections of the lower airways , whereas in the school - aged children ( 6 years and older ) it usually signifies underlying @DISEASE$ [ 6 ] and @DISEASE$	1
13098	These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for @DISEASE$	1
13099	In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September : this well - known entity is called the " September @DISEASE$ epidemics , " coincides with the start of the school year , and is likely due to a combination of infectious , allergic , environmental , and climatic triggers [ 7 ]	1
13100	Understanding the seasonal variations of ED visits due to @DISEASE$ may have important therapeutic implications in terms of a proactive treatment of at - risk subjects .	1
13101	A great deal has been learned from studying genes that tend to occur close to one another in @GENE$ [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 ]	1
13102	In particular , the co - occurrence of @GENE$ and @GENE$ can be exploited to suggest the function of the former based on the function of the latter .	1
13103	With the vast speed and minimal costs of modern sequencing technology , new demands are being placed on the bioinformatics pipelines used to analyze sequence data [ 1 ]	1
13104	Modern bioinformatics must be high throughput and high volume with a strong emphasis on comparative genomics , and the @GENE$ family of resources for genome interpretation and analysis were specifically constructed to embody these characteristics [ 15 ]	1
13105	The @GENE$ resources are built upon the organization of biology into a modular set of subsystems , each describing a specific biological functionality ( e	1
13106	g	1
13107	, flagellar motility or histidine biosynthesis ) [ 16 ]	1
13108	Subsystems - based technologies were developed in the SEED with the view that the interpretation of one genome can be made more efficient and consistent if hundreds of genomes are simultaneously annotated in one subsystem at a time [ 16 , 17 ]	1
13109	The SEED Project , a multi - institutional effort coordinated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes ( FIG ) and Argonne National Laboratory , began with the ambitious goal of consistently annotating 1 , 000 @GENE$ ( http : / / theseed	1
13110	org / wiki / Annotating _ 1000 _ genomes ) ; today , over 50 , 000 @GENE$ have been annotated by the subsystems technology	1
13111	More recently , the SEED Project has been expanded to include the capacity to automatically generate genome - scale metabolic models based on SEED annotations of genome sequences , and the Model @GENE$ system developed from this pipeline has now been applied to construct metabolic models for thousands of genomes [ 18 , 19 , 20 ]	1
13112	The @GENE$ family of resources now collectively serves as a repository for almost 5 , 000 distinct complete @GENE$ , associated with approximately 30 , 000 annotations , 11 , 000 metabolic models , 178 , 000 @GENE$ , 10 , 250 functional roles , and 1 , 060 subsystems .	1

13115	Secondary infections in humans are immunologically stressful [ 58 ]	1
13116	Little brown bats are particularly susceptible to a frequently lethal @DISEASE$ known as the @DISEASE$ , caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]	1
13117	A study looking at the effects of @DISEASE$ fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus showed that bats having the fungal infection in wings had 60 times more coronavirus in their intestines as compared to fungal uninfected bats [ 62 ]	1
13118	The intestines of the fungus - infected bats exhibited a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response , which may have contributed to unrestrained viral replication	1
13119	This suggests that secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding .	1
13120	ographs attributable to the @DISEASE$ attack on day t	1
13121	Since each simulated outbreak will be different , we start by summarizing the distribution of { O k , t }	1

13127	975 quantiles calculated over the 500 simulated realizations for each day t .	1
13128	Next , we describe a simplified health - utilization model for people entering the ED , based on ideas discussed in [ 16 ]	1
13129	During the incubation stage , we assume that no infected people enter the ED	1
13130	Non - infected people that enter the ED for other @DISEASE$ are part of the background data	1
13131	During the prodromal and fulminant stages we assume a simple Markov model of utilization : each infected subject is a Bernoulli event , independent across days	1
13132	At the prodromal stage people enter the ED with probability P d on a weekday and P w on weekends	1
13133	At the fulminant stage the probability of entering the ED , P f say , is larger than the probabilities in the prodromal stage	1
13134	The reason is that at the fulminant stage , the @DISEASE$ symptoms are similar to those of a @DISEASE$ and therefore people enter the ED with higher probability	1
13135	The differentiation between weekday and weekend is irrelevant at this stage	1
13136	We suppose that a small percentage of people in the prodromal or fulminant stages are misdiagnosed and thus need to re - enter the system	1
13137	Also , we assume that people can potentially be misdiagnosed a maximum of two times during the same attack ( 10 % in the first visit and 5 % in the second visit )	1
13138	The probabilities of entering the ED after being misdiagnosed are increased by an additive factor , C , for every additional entry	1
13139	Our model allows for a small probability of drop - out , to account for other ways of leaving the system ( e	1
13140	g	1
13141	, pharmacy visit )	1
13142	The health - utilization model could easily be extended to include , e	1
13143	g	1
13144	, varying probabilities of entering the ED by stage / time , and / or more advanced ways to exit the system .	1

13149	The SCH07072 line showed the lowest @GENE$ expression compared to that of the other two lines ( SCH07041 and SCH07071 ) and the	1
13150	Although the spring season in Japan is cold , some fly species are present	1
13151	However , no studies have been reported on the possible role of flies in transmission of @DISEASE$	1
13152	Therefore , an entomological survey was conducted in March 2004 to investigate the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 virus , using flies collected from around the infected poultry farm in Tamba Town for virus detection and isolation	1
13153	Blow fly collection was carried out on 10 - 11 March 2004 , just after the H5N1 outbreak at poultry farm B [ 11 ]	1
13154	A sunny place protected from strong wind was selected , and rotten fish bait was placed on the ground	1
13155	A total of 926 flies were collected within a 2	1
13156	3 km radius of poultry farm A in Tamba Town ( Figure 2 ) , representing eight fly species with > 80 % of the collected flies identified as either Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven or Aldrichina grahami ( Aldrich ) ( Figure 3 )	1

13160	The prevalence of H5 subtype virus ( 20 - 30 % ) was higher in flies of both species collected 600 - 700 m from poultry farm A and lower ( 10 % ) in flies collected > 2 km from poultry farm A	1
13161	We found that nearly 5 % of C	1
13162	nigribarbis collected around the affected areas contained infectious H5N1 viruses	1
13163	viral M , HA , an@GENE$ ied by PCR with universal primers , full - length sequences were analyzed , and sizes were found to be 991 , 1 , 707 , and 1 , 362 bp , respectively	1
13164	These sequences showed high similarity to those of strains from chickens ( A / chicken / Kyoto / 3 / 2004 ) and crows ( A / crows / Kyoto / 53 / 2004 ) isolated during the 2004 outbreaks in Kyoto , with > 99	1
13165	9 % identity for all three genes	1
13166	The virus from C	1
13167	nigribarbis ( A / blow fly / Kyoto / 93 / 2004 ) was characterized as an H5N1 subtype @DISEASE$ virus based on neuraminidas @GENE$ equences	1

13169	Finally , virus isolated from C	1
13170	nigribarbis was characterized as a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype influenza A virus .	1
13171	This study is organized as follows : after the introduction , section 2 presents the methodology of city - level carbon accounting in Guangzhou and the method to decompose the changes in carbon emissions during the whole research period	1
13172	Section 3 addresses the case analysis and the main results of Guangzhou city	1
13173	Finally , we conclude our study and provide some policy implications for low - carbon city development .	1

13183	In terms of the resources made available to fund @DISEASE$ programs , it was reported that MOH had effectively funded @DISEASE$ control programs and research in all public hospitals .	1
13184	Research networks exist , in part , to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between members , so as to benefit the activities of individual members and the network as a whole [ 21 , 151 ]	1
13185	By establishing a common database and data collection standards , networks make it easier for their members to engage in collaborative projects and to leverage additional resources that may be useful in one ' s research	1
13186	Members are encouraged to share data with others in the network but are also allowed the option to withhold certain information as deemed necessary	1
13187	An important consideration , therefore , when creating a database is to develop data sharing agreements between network members	1
13188	A good example of this is the EIDITH web - based database developed to collate and curate data for the USAID PREDICT project that operates in ≈ 30 countries around the world [ 152 ]	1
13189	Such databases are only successful if network participants contribute in a trusting manner	1
13190	Willingness to share data may be facilitated by individual or country - level security settings that enable restricted access to particular data or datasets , thereby alleviating national concerns about the sharing of potentially sensitive information .	1
13191	According to the urban emissions inventory in Guangzhou and Eq ( 1 ) , we calculated the energy - related carbon emissions from 2003 to 2013	1
13192	Total energy - related carbon emissions mainly include two parts , namely , carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion and out of the boundary embodied in the imported electricity ( Fig 3 )	1
13193	Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity need to be calculated by considering the total amount of imported electricity and the corresponding emissions factor of power generation The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model [ 56 ]	1
13194	As for China ' s power supply system , electricity is supplied by the main six regional grids five - year plan period , respectively	1
13195	) , which were issued by the central government and performed by the local government	1
13196	But in fact , carbon emissions mitigation in the boundary mainly benefited from contributions of the imported electricity from the neighbors Guizhou and Yunnan provinces via the cross - province electricity trades	1
13197	During the same period , carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity dramatically increased 3	1
13198	236 million tons in 2010 to 4	1
13199	379 million tons in 2013	1
13200	Rapidly increasing carbon emissions embodied in imported electricity indicated that there were large amounts of fossil energy were burned for power	1
13201	Final products - thermal power was consumed in Guangzhou , while carbon emissions were discharged in its neighbor producers	1
13202	If these carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity were allocated to the final consumer , Guangzhou would have paid more efforts and implemented more strict mitigation measures to achieve its energy saving and emission reduction targets .	1
13203	The survey instrument was developed by Toronto Public Health for use in a telephone survey of the general public following the @DISEASE$ outbreak	1
13204	The data reported in this paper are derived from a subset of 15 survey items specifically designed to measure public attitudes towards the use of quarantine during @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
13205	These items addressed issues ranging from the legality of restrictive measures , the perceived effectiveness of quarantine , and the supports that should be supplied to those affected by quarantine orders	1
13206	Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement / disagreement with each item ; the response format was a 5 - point Likert - type design ( 1 = " Strongly Disagree " ; 2 = " Somewhat Disagree " ; 3 = " Neutral " ; 4 = " Somewhat Agree " ; and 5 = " Strongly Agree " ) .	1
13207	@GENE$ ranged from 0	1
13208	9 to 2	1
13209	6 % of total @GENE$ in the seminal fluid specimens and from 0	1
13210	1 to 0	1
13211	6 % of total @GENE$ in the CVL fluids specimens ( Figure S6 ) .	1
13212	The first @DISEASE$ model system developed depended on intraperitoneal Candida injections in susceptible mouse strains [ 72 ]	1
13213	This is shown to @GENE$ ntigen response mechanism	1
13214	Similarly , mice developed @DISEASE$ after intraperitoneal injection with Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract	1
13215	Pathogenesis in this model parallels @DISEASE$ in that younger mice are more predisposed to develop @DISEASE$ and there is a favorable response to IVIG treatment	1
13216	This disease exhibits mostly a T - cell infiltrate in coronary arterial specimens [ 42 ]	1
13217	In fact , in both RAG -@GENE$ ] and TCR -@GENE$ ] deficient mice , this @DISEASE$ is diminished [ 75 ]	1
13218	Other models depend on immun@GENE$ ition	1
13219	This was observed after bovin@GENE$ tion into rabbits , which exhibited a disease similar to @DISEASE$ [ 76 ]	1
13220	A number of the model systems have granulomatous changes , which have variably been seen in human specimens [ 77 ]	1
13221	Presently , there is not a model system consistent with direct infectious coronary artery invasion nor that exactly replicates the pathologic changes seen in humans [ 78 ]	1
13222	Considering that the cause in humans is unknown , it is unclear if any of these models of @DISEASE$ are truly applicable	1
13223	Although most data from model systems are supportive of superantig@GENE$ t , studies from human peripheral lymphocyte responses are variable and inconsistent [ 79 ] .	1
13224	Female BALB / c mice ( 6 to 10 - week - old ) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Sulzfeld , Germany )	1
13225	For experimental work , mice were housed in an isolated ( ISO ) cage unit ( Tecniplast , Hohenpeißenberg , Germany ) and had free access to food and water	1
13226	All animal experiments were handled in compliance with the German regulations for animal experimentation ( Animal Welfare Act , approved by the Government of Upper Bavaria , Munich , Germany ) .	1
13227	Reactivation of the @GENE$ , manifesting as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ formation at t@GENE$ CG site months or years after inoculation , has been described as an important feature of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 5 , 6 ] .	1
13228	Microglia are hypothesized to act as immediate responders to CNS pathogens as resident APCs that coordinate intra - parenchymal adaptive immune response [ 54 ]	1
13229	Previous studies indicated that clearance of WNV in the CNS requires antiviral CD8 + T cells [ 19 , 32 , 55 ] , and that microglia , astrocytes , and neurons express @GENE$ that attract mononuclear cells to the CNS [ 21 , 56 , 57 ]	1
13230	To determine the impact of @GENE$ antagonism on recruitment of these cells to the CNS , leukocytes isolated from the cortices of WNV - NS5 - E218A - infected ( See figure on previous page	1

13266	As expected , CD45 lo CD11b + ( P1 ) population , which is primarily microglia [ 58 ] , remained significantly depleted in the PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig	1
13267	6a - c )	1
13268	The population of CD45 hi CD11b + ( P2 ) , which is primarily infiltrating monocytes / macrophages [ 58 ] , were non - significantly reduced in the PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice	1
13269	However , the number of CD45 hi CD11b neg ( P3 ) lymphocyte population [ 58 ] were non - significantly elevated in PLX5622 - treated compared with control mice , though the percentage of this population was significantly elevated ( Fig	1
13270	6a - c )	1
13271	This increase was largely due to elevated numbers of CD8 + T cell infiltration in PLX5622 - treated mice ( Fig	1
13272	6d - f )	1
13273	Though there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD8 + T cells specific for the WNV immunodominant peptide between PLX5622 and control - treated mice , there were significantly more WNV - specific CD8 + T cells isolated from PLX5622 compared with control - treated cortex ( Fig	1
13274	6g - i )	1
13275	Despite the increased infiltration of WNV - specific CD8 + T cells in PLX5622 - treated mice , the percentages of cells expressing early activation marker CD69 and their level of expression were significantly reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig	1
13276	6j - m )	1
13277	Additionally , the percentage of WNV - specific CD8 + T cells positive for CD160 as well as the level of CD160 expression , which is specifically expressed on highly activated CD8 + T cells [ 59 ] , were reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice	1
13278	However , the numbers of NS4B + CD8 + cells positive for either CD69 or CD160 were non - significantly elevated in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated cortices ( Fig	1
13279	6l , p ) due to the increased numbers of NS4B + CD8 + cells	1
13280	Because numbers of infiltrating WNV - specific CD8 + T cells derived from the CNS of PLX5622 - treated animals were increased , we hypothesized that their lack of local reactivation may be the result of loss of co - stimulatory signals and / or inflammatory cytokines ( Fig	1
13281	3c ) in the CNS	1
13282	In order to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes / macrophages , CNS myeloid cells were examined for expression of the microglia - specific marker P2RY12 ( Fig	1
13283	7a )	1
13284	Infiltrating monocytes / macrophages were then identified via gating of P2RY12 neg CD11b + cells ( Fig	1

13286	Populations of both CNS - derived P2RY12 + CD45 + microglia ( P1 , Fig	1
13287	7a ) and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + monocytes / macrophages ( P2 , Fig	1
13288	7b ) were reduced in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig	1
13289	7i , j )	1
13290	While no differences in the overall number of cells expressing MHCII were observed in P2RY12 + CD45 + , a significant reduction of MHCII + CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + was seen ( Fig	1
13291	7c , d , l )	1
13292	This corresponded with a relative increase in the percentage of MHCII + cells in both P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + populations due to the decreased numbers of total P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells in the cortices of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice ( Fig	1
13293	7k )	1
13294	However , the numbers of P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing B7 co - stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 were significantly reduced in the CNS of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated animals ( Fig	1
13295	7e - h , m - p )	1
13296	The percentage of remaining P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing CD80 or CD86 were not reduced ( Fig	1
13297	7m , o ) ; however , the percentage of remaining CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells expressing CD86 was significantly reduced ( Fig	1
13298	7o ) , similar to results seen in peripheral APCs ( Figs	1
13299	4 , 5 ) Together , these data suggest that resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are important sources of CD80 and CD86 in the CNS , and PLX5622 treatment depletes these cellular sources of co - stimulatory molecules .	1
13300	In spite of reports of a number of structures of @GENE$ from bacteria ( Crennell et al	1

13314	Clinical signs included @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and the median age at diagnosis was 4 months ( range 1 - 18 months )	1
13315	All cats were treated , and outcomes were known in 12 cases , of which 8 died or were euthanised , and 4 survived .	1
13316	A single FPV lineage ( clade A ) was responsible for disease in both outbreak regions in Victoria , Australia , even though these are geographically distant ( 550 km ) from each other	1
13317	Phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest related virus was taken from a domestic cat in Japan in 1994 ( GenBank accession no	1
13318	AB000050 ) , although it is likely that a closer ancestral virus exists but has not been sampled here	1
13319	The 100 % sequence identity of @GENE$ sequences from cases in Mildura and Melbourne is consistent with the epidemiological investigation , which found evidence supporting direct viral spread through transport of unvaccinated cats for adoption in 2014 and 2015	1
13320	The nonenveloped virions of FPV , shed in high titres in all excretions of infected animals , are environmentally resilient and remain viable in infected premises such as shelters for over a year [ 17 , 18 ]	1
13321	Indirect transmission by fomites is a major mechanism of parvovirus transmission among cats and dogs and was likely a crucial contributing factor to the canine global @DISEASE$ pandemic in the late 1970s [ 19 ] .	1
13322	Although the authors provide an explanation of the methods that can be used to achieve such source control for each pollutant , it is not clear how the specific reduction % was decided upon in each case	1
13323	Are the reductions based on evidence or just plausible best guesses ? For example , how do you know that implementing compulsory alarms will reduce CO sources by exactly 90 % ?	1

13341	Detailed mapping analysis of the cellular responses induced by either the Brazilian or MR766 prME vaccines revealed that both vaccines induced a significant cellular response against the dominant @GENE$ as identified in Figure 2b and c for the @GENE$ ( data not shown )	1
13342	The @GENE$ consistently induced more robust responses in these T - cell assays at the same dose and was evaluated further in additional assays .	1
13343	These issues frame the @DISEASE$ epidemic in Liberia as political as the operational processes at the local , national , and international organizations had a negative impact on the most vulnerable Liberians	1
13344	Given this context of vulnerability , many scholars investigated the response pathways undertaken .	1
13345	Another limitation is the time frame of the study	1
13346	Scholarly literature is consistently evolving , and in the specific case of the @DISEASE$ epidemic , which was considered a public health emergency of international concern at the time of data collection , new and relevant research was being produced after data collection ended	1
13347	For feasibility purposes , data collection ended in June 2017 .	1
13348	Canine parvovirus ( CPV ) is a member of autonomous parvoviruses in the Parvoviridae family	1
13349	It appears as an icosahedral capsid that encloses a @GENE$ that is 5	1
13350	2 kb long	1
13351	CPV replicates without the use of a helper virus and hence is called autonomous , but it utilises the machinery and components of host cells , including @GENE$ and @GENE$ Ι for DNA replication and RNA transcription , respectively	1
13352	Consequently , CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1 , 2 .	1
13353	Consensus sequence reconstruction in the genome coding regions @GENE$	1
13354	Sequence data was obtained from amino acid 76 through the end of the @GENE$	1
13355	One amino acid substitution , F80L , differentiated the 2003 - 10 samples from the 1995 - 96 samples ( Table 2 )	1
13356	The samples from 2000 also had an F at residue 80 but differed from the other Humboldt samples at residue 106 with D replaced by G	1
13357	A subset of the 2009 - 10 samples from southernmost region of the outbreak area and collected early in the outbreak ( foxes 5 , 2 , and 20 ) had an N to S substitution at @GENE$	1
13358	@GENE$	1
13359	Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples primarily according to date , with limited grouping according to geography	1
13360	Only one amino acid change , R30K , differentiated the 2003 - 10 samples from 1995 - 96 samples ( Figure S3 )	1
13361	This residue lies in a @GENE$ of the protein [ 21 , 22 ]	1
13362	The samples from 2000 differed from the 1995 - 96 at two sites , R86K and E156G , and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K	1
13363	Sequence data for the @GENE$ was available for other @DISEASE$ samples in GenBank including one from neighboring Trinity Co	1
13364	collected in 1997 ( V650 CASK ) ; all had an R at@GENE$  , thus the R30K change is unique to the 2003 / 10 outbreak	1
13365	, the@GENE$  had low coverage due to difficulty obtaining@GENE$  for this region ( Figure S1 )	1
13366	The primers for this project were designed prior to availability of@GENE$  for the CA skunk variant , thus making primer design especially problematic for@GENE$  of the genome	1
13367	This likely impacts the number of subconsensus variants detected in this region .	1
13368	Because dinucleotide biases can affect codon bias , the relative abundance of dinucleotides in the @GENE$ of @GENE$ was assessed using the method described by Karlin and Burge [ 24 ]	1
13369	A comparison of actual and expected dinucleotide frequencies of the 16 dinucleotides in coding region of the 48 @GENE$ was also undertaken	1
13370	The odds ratio r xy = ƒ xy / ƒ y ƒ x , where ƒ x denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X , ƒ y denotes the frequency of the @GENE$ , ƒ y ƒ x the expected frequency of the dinucleotide XY and ƒ xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY , etc	1
13371	, for each dinucleotide were calculated	1
13372	As a conservative criterion , for r xy > 1	1
13373	23 ( or < 0	1
13374	78 ) , the @GENE$ is considered to be of over - represented ( or under - represented ) relative abundance compared with a random association of @GENE$ .	1
13375	Zinc oxide : it has been shown that the addition of zinc ( Zn ) as zinc oxide ( ZnO ) at the levels of 2400 - 3000 ppm in pig feed was effective in the reducing of @DISEASE$ and mortality and in improving growth performance in weaned pigs [ 111 , 112 ]	1
13376	However , Amezcua and collaborators [ 1 ] reported an important proportion of farms with @DISEASE$ occurrence using high levels of ZnO	1
13377	Also , several studies reported an increased proportion of E	1
13378	coli isolates resistant to tetracycline and sulfonamides in pigs fed with high zinc doses [ 113 , 114 ]	1
13379	This may explain why antimicrobial resistance persists even in the absence of antimicrobial exposure [ 115 , 116 ]	1
13380	Moreover , the use of high zinc levels in pig feeds has led to heavy metal contamination in the soil , raising environmental concerns [ 115 ]	1
13381	Recently , Bouwhuis et al	1
13382	[ 117 ] reported that organic zinc [ zinc methionine ( ZnM ) ] could be used as a substitute for the inorganic zinc ( ZnO ) in the pig diet	1
13383	In fact , organic zinc can be supplemented in lower doses ( up to 500 mg / kg feed ) compared to ZnO [ 117 ]	1
13384	In this study , the inclusion of ZnM resulted in improved faecal scores and the intestinal architecture compared to that observed in pigs supplemented with ZnO .	1
13385	The average concentration change in the breathing levels in the ward was generally small	1
13386	To further investigate which input structures are good to use when G big is not known , we use the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by @GENE$ ( including the @GENE$ )	1
13387	Then for each @GENE$ we run our methods on all 50 suboptimal structures and choose the one with the lowest free energy as the final result for that @GENE$	1
13388	With this approach , the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure of HFold and Iterative @GENE$ is ( 61	1
13389	80 % , 80	1
13390	63 % ) and ( 67	1
13391	70 % , 79	1
13392	57 % ) respectively for @GENE$ and ( 77	1
13393	17 % , 82	1
13394	35 % ) and ( 76	1
13395	27 % , 81	1
13396	46 % ) respectively for @GENE$ - free structures	1
13397	The permutation test indicates that the difference between these results and the corresponding results when input structures are hotspots is not significant	1
13398	We also test the significance of results of HFold with first 50 @GENE$ versus Iterative HFold with the same input structures and Iterative @GENE$ with @GENE$ for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures	1
13399	Although the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals for average F - measures seem different , the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant	1
13400	Similarly , results of Iterative @GENE$ with the first 50 suboptimal structures are not significantly better or worse than the result of HFold with @GENE$ as input structures for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures .	1
13401	As shown in Figure 2A , Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from about 54 % to 79 % as the user provides 1 % to 40 % of the input structure	1
13402	This improvement in accuracy slows down but still persists when further structural information is provided	1
13403	If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold ' s average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A , we can see that HFold ' s slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold , making Iterative HFold more robust than @GENE$	1
13404	For pseudoknot - free structures of the HK - PK - free data set , as shown in Figure 2B , HFold performs better than Iterative HFold	1
13405	Even with 1 % information about G big , HFold results in ( 79	1
13406	76 % , 84	1
13407	32 % ) 95 % bootstrap confidence interval in comparison with ( 79	1
13408	14 % , 83	1
13409	84 % ) for Iterative HFold with the same inputs	1
13410	Roughly , HFold ' s success for pseudoknot - free structures is because it often http : / / www	1

13413	Ubiquitination is a widely used posttranslational modification that has emerged as a key regulator of synapse development and function ( DiAntonio and Hicke , 2004 ; Mabb and Ehlers , 2010 )	1
13414	Ubiquitination of a growing list of @GENE$ can regulate their stability , function and subcellular localization ( Mabb and Ehlers , 2010 ; Bingol and Sheng , 2011 ; Kowalski and Juo , 2012 )	1
13415	The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins is catalyzed by a sequence of enzymatic reactions mediated by @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Hershko and Ciechanover , 1998 )	1
13416	@GENE$ itself has seven lysine residues and a primary amine at its @GENE$ that can be utilized to form @GENE$	1
13417	Monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination , using various chain - linkage types , create distinct structural topologies that are recognized by @GENE$ that mediate the various functions of @GENE$	1
13418	For example , Lys48 - and Lys11 - linked polyubiquitination result in proteasomal degradation , whereas Lys63 - linked polyubiquitination is typically associated with signaling and endo - lysosomal trafficking ( Piper and Lehner , 2011 ; Clague et al	1
13419	, 2012 ; Nathan et al	1
13420	, 2013 )	1
13421	Ubiquitin can be removed from substrates by @GENE$ called @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
13422	The @GENE$ encodes approximately 100 @GENE$ that are categorized into six families	1
13423	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) make up the largest family , comprised of 54 @GENE$ ( Nijman et al	1
13424	, 2005 ; Mevissen and Komander , 2017 ) .	1
13425	Flexible fibroscopic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage :	1
13426	The effective management and control of such infections is increasingly done with substantial input from mathematical models , which are used not only to provide information on the nature of the infection itself , through estimates of key parameters such as the basic reproductive ratio R 0 [ 11 ] , but also to make predictions about the likely outcome of alternative courses of action [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
13427	During the 2001 outbreak of @DISEASE$ in the United Kingdom , for example , the former UK Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries , and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics	1
13428	It is becoming increasingly important , therefore , that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions , and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization	1
13429	Here , we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods	1
13430	In particular , we show that without greater care in model formulation , we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations .	1
13431	To test our hypothesis and better understand the evolution of @DISEASE$ , we applied deep - sequencing to 44 unpassaged @DISEASE$ virus samples from the Humboldt epizootic	1
13432	Sequence data were generated by two different platforms ( Illumina and 454 ) and by three different commercial services to determine reproducibility	1
13433	For 40 of the samples , approximately 11 kb o@GENE$ enome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform ( the remaining 4 samples were sequenced using the 454 platform only )	1
13434	Average coverage was 17 , 4486 and this allowed characterization of the @DISEASE$ virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths .	1
13435	Cells cultured in 60 mm dish were transfected in triplicate with respective @GENE$	1
13436	Control samples were transfected with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
13437	Forty - eight hours post - transfection , cells were fixed in 1 % formaldehyde and ChIP assay was performed as described elsewhere [ 24 ]	1
13438	@GENE$ for amplification of @GENE$ were 5 0 CAGGGAGT CCAGTTCAGGGA 3 0 and 5 0 TGAGTCCGGGTGGGTGC GTG 3 0 , respectively and for amplification of @GENE$ were 5 0 GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAA TC 3 0 and 5 0 TTCCT TCCGGTGGTTTCTTC 3 0 , respectively .	1
13439	The @GENE$ inhibitory activity of the @GENE$ may be mediated by its ability to directly associate with the F - box protein @GENE$ and inhibit the assembly of the @GENE$	1
13440	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ .	1
13441	Until now , the role of the vast variety of DUBs in the replication cycle of viruses is poorly understood , although there is an increasing evidence that besides @DISEASE$ also other virus families evolved strategies to hijack the UPS in order to accomplish their own replication successfully	1
13442	For instance , it could be shown@GENE$ gases as well a@GENE$ asome play an important role in various steps of virus replication , e	1

13444	, entry , maturation and latent virus reactivation [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]	1
13445	Regarding the role of DUBs in HIV - 1 replication , it has been shown that the ESCRT - III interactin@GENE$  AMSH ( associated molecule wit@GENE$ oma@GENE$  STAM ) can inhibit viral particle production , @GENE$  AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release [ 79 ]	1
13446	Interestin@GENE$  AMSH has been reported to bind to the ESCRT - III comp@GENE$ CHMP3 upon coexpression , which then acts as inhibitor of HIV - 1 release [ 80 ]	1
13447	Recently , selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication	1
13448	Some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]	1
13449	However , an antiretroviral activity of DIs has been reported herein for the first time .	1
13450	To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR - 619 and P22077 , HLAC [ 62 ] , prepared from human tonsil tissue , were infected with HIV - 1 NL4 - 3	1
13451	HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV - 1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [ 52 , 53 ]	1
13452	Since the replication of HIV - 1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor - dependent differences , the area under the curve ( AUC ) , representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture , was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure 5A , B , D , E , G , H , J , K )	1
13453	Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR - 619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration - dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings , irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV - 1 ( Figure 5A , B , G , H )	1
13454	An even more dramatic effect on X4 - and R5 - tropic virus replication was observed under permanent treatment with 5 μM PR - 619 ( Figure 5D , E ) or 7	1
13455	5 μM P22077 ( Figure 5J , K )	1
13456	Irrespective of treatment schemes , the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 μM PR - 619 or 15 μM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4 - and R5 - tropic viruses	1
13457	In contrast , the USP7 - specific DI P5091 , which had no impact on @GENE$ processing efficiency , did not reduce virus replication ( data not shown )	1
13458	To exclude unspecific effects of @GENE$ and @GENE$ on cell viability , water - soluble tetrazolium salt ( WST ) - 1 assays were performed	1
13459	Structured treatment with inhibitor concentrations , which completely suppressed HIV - 1 virus replication , had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 5C , I )	1
13460	Permanent treatment merely led to a slight , stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80 % at the highest concentration of @GENE$ or P22077 ( Figure 5F , L )	1
13461	Altogether , these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration - dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV - 1NL4 - 3 , independently of tropism and treatment scheme , and without showing any toxic effects	1
13462	Since the replication of HIV - 1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor - dependent differences , the area under the curve ( AUC ) , representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture , was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure 5A , B , D , E , G , H , J , K )	1
13463	Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR - 619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration - dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings , irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV - 1 ( Figure 5A , B , G , H )	1

13466	Irrespective of treatment schemes , the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 µM PR - 619 or 15 µM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4 - and R5 - tropic viruses	1
13467	In contrast , the USP7 - specific DI P5091 , which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency , did not reduce virus replication ( data not shown )	1

13469	Structured treatment with inhibitor concentrations , which completely suppressed HIV - 1 virus replication , had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 5C , I )	1
13470	Permanent treatment merely led to a slight , stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80 % at the highest concentration of PR - 619 or P22077 ( Figure 5F , L )	1
13471	Altogether , these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration - dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 , independently of tropism and treatment scheme , and without showing any toxic effects .	1
13472	From 2 weeks up to 80 days pi , the number of eggs increased but reverted to only 65 % of the pre - infection average production	1
13473	Interestingly , the 3 / 10 layers that did not lay eggs 11 weeks pi had egg yolk material in the abdomen and normal ovaries with multiple follicles	1
13474	Histological examinations linked the presence of yolk to a severe distortion of the architecture of the infundibulum , where we recorded thinning of the mucosa , diffuse presence of reactive plasmacytic aggregates and the atypical presence of ectatic glands in the lamina propria	1
13475	Although we could not examine the birds beyond the eleventh week post - infection and throughout their entire commercial life , we reckon that the histological impediment of the infundibulum had become a chronic condition that could have permanently undermined the ability of this tissue to actively capture ova and convey them to the magnum	1
13476	On the other hand , the rest of the birds completely recovered from the infection , showing no chronic lesion throughout the oviduct .	1

13479	This adaptability of bats to harbor many viruses without showing overt pathology suggests that bats have evolved immune mechanisms that allow for benign virus - host relationships .	1
13480	Taking this into consideration , acetic acid or formic acid was added into the mobile phase to suppress the ionization of the compounds	1
13481	Different concentrations of acetic acid ranging from 0	1
13482	25 to 1 % and formic acid ranging from 0	1
13483	25 to 0	1
13484	5 % were added into the mobile phase	1
13485	In addition , the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1 % ammonium acetate buffer	1
13486	It was found that 1 % ammonium acetate buffer without any addition of acetic acid or formic acid was the optimum mobile phase for separation of lycorine	1
13487	Therefore , the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile - 1 % ammonium acetate ( 15 : 85 v / v ) .	1
13488	At present , although our preferred hypothesis is that the physical presence of @GENE$ is required to lower the infectivity of viral particles , we cannot exclude the possibility that @GENE$ act on producing cells and that this action in turn leads to the production of viral particles of decreased infectivity	1
13489	Despite the fact that the overall restrictive phenotype would nonetheless remain , the underlaying mechanism would be profoundly different , as in this case the incorporation of @GENE$ would be probably a mark , but not a cause of the infectivity defect described here	1
13490	We believe the future identification of @GENE$ mutants that have lost the ability to be incorporated into viral particles may help us distinguish between these possibilities and efforts toward this goal are ongoing .	1
13491	Next , we sought to achieve the same goal in primary @DISEASE$ obtained from 2 donors	1
13492	Silenced MDM could not be maintained long enough to perform a classical spreading assay , nor sufficient virus could be obtained for a WB analysis of viral particles	1
13493	However , this setup was sufficient to obtain viral particles whose infectivity could be analyzed by MAGI assay .	1
13494	Polyamines were separated by thin - layer chromatography as previously described [ 30 ]	1
13495	For all samples , cells were treated as described prior to being trypsinized and centrifuged	1
13496	Pellets were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 200 µL 2 % perchloric acid	1
13497	Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 • C	1
13498	200 µL of supernatant was combined with 200 µL 5 mg / mL dansyl chloride ( Sigma Aldrich ) in acetone and 100 µL saturated sodium bicarbonate	1
13499	Samples were incubated in the dark overnight at room temperature	1
13500	Excess dansyl chloride was cleared by incubating the reaction with 100 µL 150 mg / mL proline ( Sigma Aldrich )	1
13501	Dansylated polyamines were extracted with 50 µL toluene ( Sigma Aldrich ) and centrifuged	1
13502	Five microliter of sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate ( silica gel matrix ; Sigma Aldrich ) and exposed to ascending chromatography with 1 : 1 cyclohexane : ethyl acetate	1
13503	The plate was dried and visualized via exposure to UV .	1
13504	Could H1N1 ever back - mutate into a strain such as the ancestral genotype that caused the catastrophic 1917 - 1918 pandemic ? Given that the modern strains of H1N1 have diverged from the original 1918 strain by nearly 2000 mutations , that many of these mutations should be slightly deleterious [ 67 ] , and that natural selection was unable to stop their continuous accumulation in the first place , it is difficult to imagine how mutation / selection might ever restore full virulence	1
13505	Reassortment might bring in new material , but thus far this has only applied to a limited section of the genome , and reassortment today occurs in a very different mutational / genomic context than that of 95 years ago	1
13506	It is often thought that a high mutation rate translates to rapid adaptation and evolution , yet the reverse seems more commonly true	1
13507	Deleterious mutations often interfere with selection for the more rare beneficial mutations [ 67 , 68 ]	1
13508	Thus , the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual extinction .	1
13509	Histological analysis showed @GENE$ expression in most hepatocytes of the transgenic mice ; these mice showed evidence of lymphocytic infiltration that was caused by the @GENE$ ( Figure 1D and E )	1
13510	These observations , in addition to the modified histology activity index ( HAI ) scores , indicated that expression of @GENE$ caused @DISEASE$ in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice because a weak , though persistent , immune response followed an initial bout of @DISEASE$ ( Figure S1 )	1
13511	Moreover , we observed a number of other pathological changes in these mice - including swelling of hepatocytes , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , abnormal accumulation of glycogen , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( Figures 1E and F , Table S1 )	1
13512	@DISEASE$ was mild in the younger mice ( day 21 ) and became increasingly severe over time ( days 120 and 180 ; Figure S2 )	1
13513	Importantly , none of the pathological changes were observed in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 1F ) .	1
13514	At present , there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$	1
13515	The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [ 11 ]	1
13516	Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with @DISEASE$ camels [ 12 , 13 ]	1
13517	These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against @DISEASE$ infection and prevention of @DISEASE$	1
13518	The World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) have listed @DISEASE$ as priority target for vaccine development [ 14 ]	1
13519	However , so far , no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I / IIa clinical testing [ 15 ]	1
13520	One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , a safety - tested and replication - deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( for review see [ 16 ] )	1
13521	In that context , we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against @DISEASE$	1
13522	It is well - known that @GENE$ directed against the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) correlate with protective immunity against @DISEASE$ in general [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
13523	Since the S protein is @GENE$  the cell surface , S protein is @GENE$  as the major antigen to induce virus neutral@GENE$ immunogen for the development of @DISEASE$ candidate vaccines [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]	1
13524	However , based on current knowledge from the biology of β - coronaviruses , we hypothesize that also other viral proteins@GENE$ eration as immunogens and@GENE$  virus - specif@GENE$ Among those , the nucleocapsid p@GENE$ is@GENE$ at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]	1
13525	The coronavirus N @GENE$ ciated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synt@GENE$ e packaging of the viral RNA in h@GENE$ leo@GENE$ n assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]	1
13526	Furthermore , several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]	1
13527	Recently , the overexpression of MERS - CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up - regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [ 38 ]	1
13528	Despite this possible immune modulatory activity , SARS - CoV N - specific immune responses are reported to be long - lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS - CoV S - specific immunity [ 39 ]	1
13529	Likewise , we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS - CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen	1
13530	The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS - CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells	1
13531	From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS - CoV N - specific immunity is based on CD8 + T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens	1
13532	Currently , there is little information about MERS - CoV N - specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N - specific cellular immunity .	1
13533	To examine the effect of the filter upon the outbreak signature we examine the standardized quantity for the filters that we defined previously	1
13534	We set α = 0	1
13535	03 , which corresponds to a false alarm rate of one per month [ 2 ]	1
13536	Then , as shown in the Appendix , the threshold , τ k , α , is chosen by solving P ( D k , t > τ k , α ) = α for τ k , α	1
13537	Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 - α quantile of the { D k , t } process of non - outbreak - based training data , or via a normal approximation , given by ( 10 )	1
13538	There were some differences between the values of τ k , α for the two methods in the simulations we studied	1
13539	We chose the normal approximation method as it tended to preserve the specificity across the filters and EDs that we considered .	1
13540	In summary , @DISEASE$ incidence , as well as pathogen detection rates , were higher during postmonsoon and winter in Bangladesh	1
13541	HRV and RSV were the predominant viral causative agents in under - five @DISEASE$	1
13542	On the other hand , S	1
13543	pneumoniae came out as the most prevalent bacterial causative agent	1
13544	Children aged less than one year of age were most susceptible to infections including coinfections .	1
13545	To knock down the expression of @GENE$ in PK - 15 cells , a lentivirus vector - mediated @GENE$ targeting @GENE$ was constructed	1
13546	Briefly , the @GENE$ of @GENE$ for @GENE$ and non - targeting @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) are listed in Table 1	1
13547	The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the lentivirus vector @GENE$ ( Clontech )	1
13548	The resulting recombinant plasmids @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ were cotransfected with the packaging plasmids @GENE$ and @GENE$ into HEK293T cells in 10 - cm cell dishes	1
13549	At 48 hpt , the lentiviruses in the culture supernatant were concentrated at [UNK] for 20 min at 4 [UNK] C using an Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel - 100 membrane ( catalog no	1
13550	UFC910096 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA )	1
13551	The lentiviuses were titrated and transduced into PK - 15 cells as described above	1
13552	Knockdown of @GENE$ was validated by Western blotting using the anti - eEF1A MAb ( 1 : 2000 ) .	1
13553	Since @GENE$ binds to @GENE$ among @GENE$ [ 35 ] , it is possible for @GENE$ to bind to the similar RNA structures located in @GENE$ of the @GENE$	1
13554	It has been shown that interaction between @GENE$ and the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ facilitates the viral minus - strand RNA synthesis [ 30 , 36 , 37 ]	1
13555	In the present study , we demonstrated that @GENE$ binds to @GENE$ located in the @GENE$ of CSFV	1
13556	Whether @GENE$ binds to @GENE$ of CSFV and influences RNA replication requires further study	1
13557	We showed that @GENE$ inhibits CSFV growth and reduces @GENE$ activity of CSFV	1
13558	Thus , we speculate that @GENE$ affects the process of the viral protein translation via interacting with the @GENE$ .	1

13565	MAbs HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains ( in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2 , the J chain expression plasmid was included )	1
13566	Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7 - 10 days of culture	1
13567	HGN194 dIgA1 , dIgA2 , and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M ( dIgA1 and dIgA2 ) or Protein A ( IgG1 ) chromatography	1
13568	Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1 - specific Abs ( Southern Biotech )	1
13569	Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native - PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography	1
13570	The presence of dIgA1 and dIgA2 associated J - chain was confirmed by Western blot from native and SDS - PAGE gels	1
13571	Sera from 20 Zambian clade C - infected subjects ( obtained from Zdenek Hel , University of Alabama , Birmingham ) were pooled for IgG isolation using the Pierce Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
13572	Env - specific IgG , determined as for CVL and seminal fluid ( see below ) , was 0	1
13573	98 % of total IgG	1
13574	Sera from five uninfected individuals were pooled and processed for IgG isolation in the same manner .	1
13575	With respect to female - to - male transmission , the penis comes in contact with vaginal secretions that would remain at acidic pH at least until ejaculation , allowing time for exposure of penile tissues , including the foreskin and urethra , to IgG - coated virus at low pH [ 28 , 29 ]	1
13576	Our demonstration of abundant @GENE$ on human penile urethral epithelium supports a model where exposure to antibodybound HIV - 1 might lead to enhanced female - to - male transmission	1
13577	It should be noted that the pH of vaginal secretions is typically about 4 , which is below the pH required for @GENE$ binding [ 48 ]	1
13578	However , there is substantial variability in normal vaginal pH [ 26 , 48 ] , and we did begin to observe enhanced transcytosis at pH 4	1
13579	5 ( Figure S3H )	1
13580	Furthermore , it is possible that there is some buffering effect of foreskin and urethral secretions	1
13581	The foreskin , whose presence increases @DISEASE$ infection rate , could trap secretions conta@GENE$ lexes and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH ran@GENE$  FcRn binding [ 49 ]	1
13582	Additionally , @DISEASE$ , a condition associated with an increased risk of female - to - male ( as well as male - female ) @DISEASE$ transmission , results in vaginal secretions ideal fo@GENE$ n binding [ 26 , 27 , 50 ]	1
13583	Exposure of penile tissues to the pH range o@GENE$ n binding may also occur after ejaculation , since complete neutralization of vaginal acidity may not occur immediately or at all [ 29 ]	1
13584	It is also possible , though less likely , tha@GENE$ n mediates @DISEASE$ transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse , where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions [ 30 ] .	1
13585	Urbanization level of Guangzhou is relatively high than other cities in Guangdong province and even in China	1
13586	The rapid increase in the average income of urban residents along with the high level of urbanization has made the affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) become the most dominant positive driving factor on the residential carbon emissions increment during the whole research period	1
13587	The residential energy consumption structure was mainly based on gasoline , liquefied petroleum gas , and natural gas in Guangzhou	1
13588	In order to further promote the negative effects of the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) , more clean fuels such as domestic solar systems should be added to the total residential energy consumption , and low carbon energy consumption behaviors and lifestyles should be advertised and practiced actively .	1
13589	As expected , Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications returned when searching for bat - associated CoV research in Western Asia ( Table S4 ) , likely because bats are the presumed evolutionary source of the @DISEASE$ , a virus that still infects a large number of people each year in the country due to the transmission from @DISEASE$ camels to humans [ 40 , 43 ]	1
13590	In the absence of many primary studies on CoVs in bats from the region , our PubMed searches would have also identified publications that mention bats in the abstracts and titles , e	1
13591	g	1
13592	, of review papers [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ]	1
13593	Bat - CoV characterization from Saudi Arabia [ 40 ] and Lebanon [ 130 ] are two of the notable studies that reported primary results from on - the - ground virus surveillance efforts	1
13594	More than half of the countries in Western Asia had no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table 1 ) , demonstrating a significant gap for a viral family that can cause severe morbidity in human and domestic animal populations .	1
13595	" Even if you look at the wastewater treatment plants , they ' re not doing so well in removing all the pharmaceuticals , all the antibiotics	1
13596	Some can be removed very well , but some cannot	1
13597	And so , that means they will be discharged and be effluent	1

13604	All participants in the study were provided four Σ - VIROCULT swabs and transport media vials ( MW950S , Medical Wire and Equipment , Wiltshire , England ) during the first blood draw and instructions on how to use the nasal swab	1
13605	If study participants experienced @DISEASE$ symptoms , they took a nasal swab and posted the material which was tested for 22 viral targets ( Supplementary Table S1 ) as described in detail 2 .	1
13606	At the close of World War I , the H1N1 influenza A virus swept the world [ 1 ]	1
13607	During the 1917 - 1918 pandemic , approximately 40 % of the human population was infected , with a death rate above 2 %	1
13608	It is estimated that this virus killed more people than died in the world war that was just then ending	1
13609	Mortality rates have dramatically declined since then [ 2 ] , but the H1N1 flu has persisted	1
13610	As a zoonotic pathogen , the influenza virus is able to infect multiple species	1
13611	It is generally thought that aquatic waterfowl are a primary natural @DISEASE$ reservoir [ 3 ] , where there are usually no clinical symptoms [ 4 ] , and where low level transmission probably perpetuates the viral pool [ 5 ]	1
13612	All 14 influenza subtypes are maintained in waterfowl [ 5 ] .	1
13613	As we known , the @DISEASE$ ( OPV ) was among the best known viral vaccines [ 18 ]	1
13614	It has saved the lives and health of innumerable people , in particular children	1
13615	However , poliovirus is highly genetically variable	1
13616	OPV viruses may undergo transformation into circulating highly diverged VDPV , exhibiting properties hardly distinguishable from those of wild polioviruses [ 19 ]	1
13617	So far , little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses g@GENE$ red to date	1
13618	To our knowledge , this is the first report of the codon usage analysis on @DISEASE$ ( including wild strains , attenuated live vaccine strains and @DISEASE$ strains )	1
13619	In this study , we analyzed the codon usage data and base composition of 48 available representative complete ORFs of poli@GENE$ s to obtain some clues to the features of genetic evolution of the virus .	1
13620	Among the 21 % of vaccination non - responders that were older than 16 weeks , some were likely exposed to FPV prior to seroconversion , either before or after admission to the shelter , as indicated by the median vaccination - to - diagnosis interval of 7	1
13621	5 days	1
13622	The incubation period for @DISEASE$ is between 2 and 10 days [ 17 ]	1
13623	Other reasons for apparent vaccine failure include persistence of @DISEASE$ for > 16 weeks in kittens born to queens with high anti - FPV antibody titres or failure to mount an immune response to vaccination because of @DISEASE$ ( acquired or genetic ) , incorrect vaccine administration or storage errors [ 35 , 38 ] .	1
13624	In this study , we reported that the @GENE$ inhibited @GENE$ activation , hence @GENE$ expression , by disrupting TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction	1
13625	This innate immunosuppressive activity of the @GENE$ was due to its conserved @GENE$	1
13626	Our mechanistic study complemented the previous work that showed that @GENE$ had @GENE$ - antagonizing activity	1
13627	22 Both studies demonstrated that @GENE$ suppressed @GENE$ activity but not @GENE$ signaling	1
13628	It is known that the activation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ results in the activation of both @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
13629	28 , [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Our results indicated that the @GENE$ was capable of differentially suppressing the @GENE$ - induced activation of @GENE$ ( Figure 2 )	1
13630	This provides further support to the bifurcation of @GENE$ and @GENE$ signaling subsequent to @GENE$ and MAVS activation	1
13631	Further investigations should elucidate the mechanism by which the @GENE$ preferentially modulates @GENE$ activators such as @GENE$ , while sparing @GENE$ such as @GENE$	1
13632	47 We provided evidence that the TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction as well as @GENE$ phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the @GENE$ ( Figure 4 )	1
13633	Our findings fill the knowledge gap by providing novel mechanistic insight into the innate immunosuppressive activity of @GENE$ .	1
13634	Similar to the above outbreaks , the people who were most affected by @DISEASE$ were in some way socially marginalized , the poor , and more specifically , poor women	1
13635	At the global level , it was the poorer countries and communities within those regions that were most impacted : those with precarious and / or inconsistent access to health care services , lacking the resources and infrastructure to prevent , diagnose , and treat the virus ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ; Slavov et al	1
13636	2016 )	1
13637	No wonder the impact of the outbreak was more devastating in Brazil , which was already financially strained prior to the emergence of the @DISEASE$ , with limited human resources : doctors , nurses , and other specialists ( Hennigan 2016 ) , as compared to higher income countries who were more protected from the effects of the @DISEASE$ given effective prevention programs , funding , and infrastructure ( Gyawali et al	1
13638	2016 )	1
13639	Easy and extensive access to mosquito repellants , air conditioning , effective waste management programs , and low rates of urban crowding protect more economically developed countries , such as the USA from @DISEASE$ transmission ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 )	1
13640	Consequently , @DISEASE$ has aptly been labeled an @DISEASE$ ( Gyawali et al	1
13641	, 2016 , p	1
13642	3 ) ( Gyawali et al	1
13643	2016 ) .	1
13644	A combination of an ecosystem - focused perspective and a social - anthropological lens is vital Bbecause a pathogen requires a receptive population in order to cause disease ( Possas , 2016 , p	1
13645	8 ) ( Possas 2016 )	1
13646	Ultimately , the need for a cross - disciplinary response pathway cannot be understated ( Possas 2016 ) .	1
13647	This paper is the first to offer an in - depth description of the pathogenic mechanism underlying the acute and chronic drops induced by a G1 - lineage H9N2 virus in commercial layers .	1
13648	Reduced the markers of @DISEASE$ Potential source of pathogens ?	1
13649	In agreement with prior @GENE$ specificity profiling using single - amino acid fluorogenic substrates 5 , @GENE$ displayed broad specificity at the @GENE$	1
13650	In particular , @GENE$ exhibited a significant preference for P1 hydrophobic residues ( such as norleucine , leucine , tryptophan , and alanine ) , whereas proline , asparagine , and acidic residues ( aspartic acid and glutamic acid ) were significantly disfavored	1
13651	We note that norleucine is used as an isostere for methionine in the @GENE$ library	1
13652	Inspection of individual peptide cleavage events within the MSP - MS time course supported these overarching @GENE$ specificity preferences with N - terminal cleavages being impaired or blocked by disfavored residues at the @GENE$ ( or @GENE$ ) position ( Fig	1

13663	Reactions were incubated at 18 • C for 5 min prior to addition of edeine to 5 M	1
13664	Aliquots ( 1	1
13665	5 l ) were subsequently withdrawn at intervals post - edeine addition , mixed with an equal volume of 10mM EDTA , 100 g / ml @GENE$ and placed on ice	1
13666	At the end of the time - course , samples were analysed by SDS - PAGE .	1
13667	The calculations assume that all indoor originating exposures follow the mass - balance dilution even though this is not self - evident for several indoor originating pollutants , especially radon , dampness , mould and carbon monoxide	1
13668	Radon infiltrates typically from the soil below the buildings , and the infiltration may react to the under pressure indoors , which may increase in some ventilation systems at higher ventilation rates .	1
13669	From Figure 2 ( a ) ~ ( c ) , apparent and fierce fluctuation trend of the average position can be found for case 1 in all of the three directions when t > 30 s	1
13670	Fluctuation can also be found for case 2 after t > 40 s , which is not as fierce as that of case 1	1
13671	This fluctuation is because the number of the suspended aerosols is too small [ 22 ]	1
13672	Hence Figure 2 also suggests that human movement may influence the number of the suspended aerosols as well as the deposition and removal of the aerosols	1
13673	To demonstrate the effects of human movement on deposition and removal of the aerosols , Figure 3 shows the suspended fraction of all the aerosols for case 1 ~ 3	1
13674	This suspended fraction is the ratio of the number of the aerosols remained airborne to the total number of injected aerosols	1
13675	As shown in Figure 3 , the suspended fractions of case 1 ~ 3 keep decreasing	1
13676	For higher moving speed , the suspended fraction decreases more slowly	1
13677	For case 1 , when t ≥ 27	1
13678	2 s , the number of the aerosols remained airborne is less than 500 and the suspended fraction is less than 10 − 3	1
13679	When t ≥ 39	1
13680	6 s , the suspended fraction is less than 10 − 4	1
13681	For case 2 , the number of the aerosols remained airborne is larger than 500 until t = 37	1
13682	2 s and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 − 4 even after 50 s after the injections	1
13683	For case 3 , there are still more than 900 aerosols remained airborne after 50 s after the injections , and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 − 3	1
13684	This result indicates that the turbulence effects , which are induced by the movement of the standing person , can significantly lower the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols and influence the fluctuation of the average positions of the suspended aerosols	1
13685	In case 1 ~ 3 , more than 99 % of the aerosols are deposited in the cabin	1
13686	So the movement of the standing person does not significantly change the total deposition fraction of the aerosols .	1
13687	In the risk assessment approach , average or assumed values were used for the input parameters of Eq	1
13688	( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , e	1
13689	g	1
13690	the pathogen generation rate of the index patient	1
13691	In the actual outbreak case , the values of these parameters may be different from the average values because of the individual differences of the index patients	1
13692	These differences may significantly increase the uncertainty of the risk assessment results	1
13693	So the likelihood analysis was performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and assess which human movement pattern assumption was most likely to be the actual case [ 49 ]	1
13694	During the estimation of likelihood , the uncertainties of the unknown parameters were all considered in the quanta generation rate	1
13695	The quanta generation rate was the generation rate of the infective pathogens , which can be regarded as the multiple of the @GENE$ to the pathogen generation rate ( rN c f s , hr − 1 ) , as described in Sze To & Chao [ 36 ]	1
13696	While the risk assessment provided quantitative information on how did human movement affect the infection risks of the passengers , the likelihood analysis served as a better tool to estimate the unknown information in the actual outbreak case .	1
13697	Few studies have examined temporal patterns of bat Bartonella , emphasizing the general need for more longitudinal studies to understand how pathogens persist in bat populations [ 1 , 6 ]	1
13698	Here , Bartonella was detected at relatively high prevalence across both study years within each sampling site , and neither year nor its interaction with site were predictive within our analyses	1
13699	Similarly , no temporal patterns in Bartonella were observed for a limited sample of @DISEASE$ , Pipistrellus spp	1
13700	, @DISEASE$ daubentonii , and Nyctalus noctula in the United Kingdom [ 41 ]	1
13701	Such findings contrast with highly seasonal @DISEASE$ in rodents , which show high prevalence in summer and fall due to seasonality in birth and ectoparasite intensity [ 39 , 40 ]	1
13702	The lack of seasonality in our western Peruvian Amazon sample in particular could simply be due to low statistical power ; alternatively , no seasonality in infection could also be explained by the non - seasonal or less - pronounced birth pulses observed for vampire bats ( but see [ 73 ] )	1
13703	While high @DISEASE$ prevalence in bats has been proposed to stem from persistent infection [ 15 ] , this seems unlikely , as we observed possible clearance of infection in some recaptured bats	1
13704	While this could also reflect bacteria DNA loads too low to be detected by PCR , infection risk did not increase with age , as would also be expected if bats could not clear infection [ 74 ]	1
13705	However , we do note that our sample only contained adult ( n = 162 ) and subadult ( n = 28 ) bats , limiting more robust tests of age - dependent infection	1
13706	Alternatively , @DISEASE$ infections could be chronic and vary in infection intensity over time or could become latent ( i	1
13707	e	1
13708	, be undetectable in erythrocytes but persist in endothelial cells ) , particularly as infection does not appear to confer long - term immunity [ 36 ]	1
13709	Such explanations could be confronted in future work with larger sample sizes of recaptured bats , multiple assessments of infection status over time , and quantitative PCR .	1
13710	After controlling for site - level livestock biomass , vampire bat sex and forearm size were the strongest predictors of infection ( Fig 5 ) ; no interactions were significant ( all χ 2 1	1
13711	18 , p ! 0	1
13712	28 ) and were dropped from the final GLMM ( R 2 m = 0	1
13713	28 )	1
13714	The odds of @DISEASE$ were highest for vampire bats with larger forearms ( OR = 1	1
13715	2 , p < 0	1
13716	001 ) and for males ( OR = 5	1
13717	41 , p < 0	1
13718	01 ) , were marginally higher for non - reproductive individuals ( OR = 2	1
13719	36 , p = 0	1
13720	10 ) , and did not differ between subadult and adult bats ( OR = 1	1
13721	58 , p = 0	1
13722	38 ) ; our sample did not contain juveniles	1
13723	Individual bat fly intensities were highly variable ( 0 - 28 , median = 7	1
13724	5 ) and showed overdispersion ( [UNK] = 5	1
13725	08 in an intercept - only quasi - Poisson GLM )	1
13726	The bat fly GLMs showed that neither ectoparasite intensity ( OR = 0	1
13727	98 , p = 0	1
13728	81 ) nor ectoparasite presence ( χ 2 = 1	1
13729	13 , p = 0	1
13730	29 ) were associated with @DISEASE$ status	1
13731	We note that the majority of infected bats in this sample were infested with at least one bat fly ( 31 / 36 ) , limiting conclusive assessment of the ectoparasite - infection relationship	1
13732	Our multivariable quasi - Poisson GLM showed that ectoparasite load did not vary by bat sex ( χ 2 = 0	1
13733	86 , p = 0	1
13734	35 ) or bat age ( χ 2 = 0	1
13735	09 , p = 0	1
13736	77 ) .	1
13737	As part of the innate immune response against virus infections targeting the respiratory tract , such as @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( 28 , 30 , 32 ) , @DISEASE$ infection of porcine NEC also induced several chem@GENE$ L2@GENE$ L5@GENE$ d CXCL@GENE$ which would direct the migration of monocytes to the site of infection	1
13738	This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection , which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area	1
13739	In fact , @DISEASE$ were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced b@GENE$ 4 polarization	1
13740	This is relevant , as such a polarization could also be induced following @DISEASE$ of NEC through the release of al@GENE$ such as IL@GENE$ IL@GENE$ and TS@GENE$ from stressed and dying epithelial cells ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 )	1
13741	These al@GENE$ e known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL@GENE$ d IL@GENE$ which promote M2 - like macrophage polarization ( 62 ) ( 63 ) ( 64 ) ( 65 )	1
13742	In fact , our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages	1
13743	We also demonstrated that these al@GENE$ n enhance @DISEASE$ infection of macrophages , further supporting this concept .	1
13744	Statistics	1
13745	Figures and data collection analysis were done using GraphPad Prism 7 software ( Graph - Pad Software , San Diego , CA )	1
13746	For viral titrations , differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal - Wallis analysis , and for individual differences the Mann - Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was employed	1
13747	For the rest of the comparisons , such as differences between groups in the percentage of infected cells or gene expression levels , we employed a two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA )	1
13748	A P value lower than 0	1
13749	05 was considered statistically significant .	1
13750	We previously presented HFold [ 48 ] , an approach for prediction of pseudoknotted structures , motivated by two goals , namely to avoid the high running time complexity of other methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction and to leverage the hierarchical folding hypothesis	1
13751	This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot - free structure ; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure ' s free energy [ 49 ]	1
13752	Given a pseudoknot - free structure as input , HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and , relative to that constraint , has minimum free energy	1
13753	HFold ' s running time is O ( n 3 ) , significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures	1
13754	Several experts have provided evidence for , and support , the hierarchical folding hypothesis [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ]	1
13755	The class of structures that HFold can handle , density - 2 structures , is quite general and includes many important @GENE$ including @GENE$ , @GENE$ and infinite chains of interleaved bands , with arbitrary @GENE$	1
13756	( Roughly , a structure is density - 2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping @GENE$	1
13757	) Another advantage of HFold over heuristic methods such as @GENE$ or @GENE$ is that unlike these methods , @GENE$ minimizes the free energy of the possibly pseudoknotted output structure relative to the given input structure	1
13758	Therefore HFold ' s method of adding @GENE$ is better motivated energetically than that of @GENE$ or @GENE$ .	1
13759	To investigate how polyamines facilitate @DISEASE$ infection , we performed a screen for virus escape mutants that were resistant to DFMO treatment	1
13760	We isolated two distinct viral mutants in@GENE$ ases	1
13761	We determined that these mutant viruses were resistant to polyamine depletion and that these mutations conferred no fitness advantage in the absence of polyamine depletion	1
13762	To investigate the proteolytic activity of t@GENE$ ymes , we developed a protease - dependent split - luciferase reporter system to measure 2A and 3C activity	1
13763	Using this assay , we observed @GENE$ t 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion , to which mu@GENE$ ases were resistant	1
13764	Additionally , we observed that viruses containing these mutants were able to cleave cellular targets efficiently in polyamine - depleted cells	1
13765	Together , these data suggest that polyamines are crucial for v@GENE$ ease activity and that we may target CVB3 proteolytic activity through polyamine - depleting pharmaceuticals like DFMO .	1
13766	The @GENE$ inhibitory assay was performed as reported previously Cho et al	1

13768	Briefly , 15 ml GH33 @GENE$ solution ( 0	1

13775	4 - Methylumbelliferone was immediately quantified by fluorometric determination with a SpectraMax M 2e Multimode Reader ( Molecular Devices , USA )	1
13776	The excitation wavelength was 365 nm and the emission wavelength was 450 nm	1
13777	Enzyme activity was recorded over a range of pre - incubation times ( Fig	1
13778	1a ) or concentrations ( Fig	1
13779	1b )	1
13780	The data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression program ( SigmaPlot ; SPCC Inc	1
13781	, Chicago , Illinois , USA )	1
13782	The experimental enzyme activity was determined using the logistic curve represented by ( 1 ) , based on a time - driven protocol with initial velocity ,	1
13783	The @GENE$ can be divided into 3 subtypes depending on the residue at the first position : @GENE$ - , @GENE$ - and @GENE$	1
13784	8 It has been shown that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ and @GENE$ has a preference for @GENE$ , thus suggesting that the subtype of the @GENE$ could be related to a specificity toward @GENE$	1
13785	7 Additionally @GENE$ are mostly contained in @GENE$	1
13786	8 We thus analyzed the distribution of W - , F - and Y - type of WxxL and @GENE$ patterns at the viral order and family levels ( Table S4 and Fig	1
13787	2C , D )	1
13788	We observed that 45 % and 38 % of the @GENE$ matching the WxxL pattern are of @GENE$ and @GENE$ respectively	1
13789	@GENE$ are the least represented , with about 17 % of the patterns ( Fig	1
13790	2C )	1
13791	Similar distribution could be observed for the putative @GENE$ with a higher variability across families , probably due to the low representation of @GENE$ compared with @GENE$ ( Fig	1
13792	2D ) .	1

13809	Asterisks indicate the residues most important for catalytic removal of ADPr from a substrate protein	1
13810	The lack of conservation of these residues in many of the @GENE$ suggests they may be able to bind , but not catalyze removal of , ADPr	1
13811	( PDF ) Figure S6 Phylogenetic tree of intact @GENE$	1
13812	@GENE$ from vertebrates were aligned as described in Materials and Methods being careful to include only @GENE$ that were uninterrupted by frameshifts or stop codons	1
13813	Some otherwise intact genes are omitted from the tree because one or more @GENE$ are missing due to assembly gaps	1
13814	The maximum likelihood tree generated from these sequences is shown with bootstrap values indicated	1
13815	We note that the position of marsupial @GENE$ in this tree implies that the partial @GENE$ duplication that gave rise to @GENE$ occurred before the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals ; however , we have seen no evidence for the presence of @GENE$ in @GENE$ , and the use of alternate phylogeny inference parameters places the @GENE$ after ma - placental mammal divergence	1
13816	We therefore conservatively suggest that the PARP14 - 15 duplication occurred after marsupial - placental mammal divergence , rather than the less parsimonious possibility that the duplication occurred earlier and that PARP15 was subsequently lost in the marsupial ancestor	1

13820	The bushbaby genes fall in a gapped region of the genome assembly , resulting in a central region of the alignment being unreliable and therefore excluded from analysis	1
13821	( PDF )	1
13822	The patterns of evolution of the @GENE$ allow us to make several inferences about the role of these proteins in genetic conflicts	1
13823	First , the fact that we observe a robust evolutionary signature of positive selection in @GENE$ argues strongly that these genes are important for organismal fitness	1
13824	Similar to strong evolutionary conservation , signatures of positive selection indicate that fixation of a particular @GENE$ , in this case , a @GENE$ , results in a strong enhancement of fitness	1
13825	While rapid evolution may seem antithetical to functional constraint , in fact positive selection is a common hallmark of @GENE$ [ 34 ]	1
13826	Thus , we infer that the functions of the rapidly evolving @GENE$ we have identified are important for fitness in the face of rapidly - evolving pathogens	1
13827	Second , we also find that @GENE$ and @GENE$ show recurrent gene duplication and loss	1
13828	This form of genetic innovation is another common hallmark of @GENE$	1
13829	Gene losses occur during periods of relaxed selection due to non - exposure or extinction of relevant pathogen ( s ) , whereas gene duplications often provide additional genetic substrates for diversifying selection to increase anti - pathogen repertoires [ 34 , 52 ]	1
13830	While other @GENE$ , such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , have been identified as having antiviral functions , our initial screen suggests they have not been subject to strong recurrent antagonistic evolution with @GENE$ in primates , perhaps because their encoded proteins do not directly interact with @GENE$ .	1
13831	Postmortem examination confirmed generalized @DISEASE$ with diffuse @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
13832	The proximal tubules of both kidneys showed @DISEASE$ but no @DISEASE$	1

13834	Tissue cultures were negative .	1
13835	Several microorganisms have been detected in most @DISEASE$ cases but also in the controls	1
13836	The clinical significance of microbial detection by PCR is problematic at the individual level because most detected pathogens are not causes of @DISEASE$	1
13837	However , number of pathogens is predictive of the risk of @DISEASE$ , suggesting that simple quantification of species detected would permit the evaluation of @DISEASE$ risk	1
13838	At the population level , nasal samples are interesting because the prevalence of carriage in the controls is considered .	1
13839	Among the 118 patients with @DISEASE$ , 16 ( 13	1
13840	6 % ) were referred from another health center ; median length of hospital stay was 7 days ( IQR : 6 - 10 days ) for a total of 909 days of hospitalization ( Table 1 )	1

13860	The specimens had been collected before the patients received any antibiotic treatment at the hospital	1
13861	Specimens that had been collected in STGG media were subjected to a bacterial culture within 4 hours of collection , whereas specimens in VTM were stored at - 70 [UNK] C for later detection of viral pathogens by RT - qPCR .	1
13862	Cells through @GENE$	1
13863	Humoral responses are often thought to play a key role in controlling @DISEASE$ infection [ 81 ]	1
13864	In clinical setting , patients spontaneously resolving from @DISEASE$ tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response	1
13865	In contrast , @DISEASE$ patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response	1
13866	Moreover , the variety of strategies the virus evolves to escape antibodies - mediated neutralization , including the accelerated evolution and the diversity of HCV [ 82 ]	1
13867	Overall , the capacity of HCV to mutate continuously allows a high plasticity and an ability of the virus to adapt to variable environmental conditions and escape the host ' s immune responses leading to @DISEASE$ persistene	1

13875	It is well known that host humoral responses are thought to play a critical role in controlling @DISEASE$	1
13876	Several studies reported that broadly neutralizing anti@GENE$ t be directed against cons@GENE$ in E2 a@GENE$ mostly inhibit E2 - CD@GENE$ raction [ 87 , 88 ]	1
13877	Currently , new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the N - @GENE$ 2 [@GENE$  ]	1
13878	The conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry .	1
13879	Interfering with HCV entry into the hepatocytes holds great promises for the development of novel drugs	1
13880	Several potential targets are suggested : ( 1 ) blocking virus - target cell interaction during attachment and binding ; ( 2 ) interfering with postbinding events and ( 3 ) interfering with viral fusion	1
13881	Various modalities may be adopted as HCV entry inhibitors : neutralizing antibodies for @GENE$ , blocking @GENE$ specific for @GENE$ , and small molecular compounds against @GENE$ or @GENE$ .	1
13882	All children of any age were included ; however , in those aged ≤ 12 months @DISEASE$ might be mistaken for a @DISEASE$ .	1
13883	One well - described issue is decreased @GENE$ levels in patients with severe infection [ 6 ] as an element of the immunological response in the initial phase of inflammation in response to @DISEASE$ [ 7 ]	1
13884	Therefore , one approach to support critically ill patients is intravenous administration @GENE$ ns since this could potentially decrease the severity of inflammation	1
13885	Although this treatment was omitted in recent @DISEASE$ guidelines due to a lack of supporting evidence in high - quality trials [ 8 ] , several studies , including one meta - analysis , describe beneficial effec@GENE$ ulins in @DISEASE$ induced by @DISEASE$ [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]	1
13886	Furthermore , several case reports describe beneficial effects of antiviral therapy in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in @D@GENE$ omised patients [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
13887	Based on these data , we treated patients with @DISEASE$ requiring ECMO therapy with IgM - enriched immun@GENE$ tensive care unit ( ICU ) admission	1
13888	The objective of this study was to investigate whether intravenous immunoglobulin admin@GENE$  improve the clinical course of @DISEASE$ in patients treated with ECMO	1
13889	Therefore , mortality , the duration of ECMO therapy , the incidence of renal replacement therapy , the duration of vasopressor and anti - infective therapy , length of stay in the ICU , and length of stay in the hospital were analyzed retrospectively in 57 @DISEASE$ patients requiring ECMO therapy .	1
13890	It is well established that patients with an acute asthma exacerbation are at high risk for future episodes [ 2 ]	1
13891	This specific patient group should receive appropriate controller therapy , but leaning on following outpatients ' visits has been demonstrated not to be reliable , as shown by a study on 3435 ED visits for @DISEASE$ in children , only 18 % of whom had a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids in the 2 months following the ED visit , only 12 % attended follow - up appointments , and only 5	1
13892	2 % received both [ 25 ]	1
13893	Even if the guidelines do not state that ED physicians should identify children with persistent @DISEASE$ and start long - term therapy , some authors suggest that , in appropriate patients , inhaled corticosteroids might be prescribed at ED discharge [ 24 , 26 ] ; however , the rates of such prescriptions are low [ 25 , 26 ] .	1
13894	Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales , and are known to infect a variety of hosts	1
13895	Several human coronaviruses have been identified , causing mainly mild @DISEASE$ , with the exception of severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
13896	In addition , @DISEASE$ have an economic impact on livestock industries worldwide	1
13897	The avian coronavirus , @DISEASE$ ( IBV ) , causes infectious @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , a mild @DISEASE$ , but as a consequence is responsible for serious effects on the global poultry industries due to poor weight gain in broiler chickens as well as reduced egg production and egg quality in layers	1
13898	In addition , some strains of IBV are nephropathogenic whilst others result in severe pathology in the reproductive organs	1
13899	Bovine coronavirus ( BCoV ) causes @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in cattle , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) cause @DISEASE$ in pigs and @DISEASE$ ( PHEV ) causes @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in pigs .	1
13900	The emergence and worldwide dispersal of novel human pathogens is increasingly challenging global public health [ 1 ] .	1
13901	Many zoonotic viruses antagonize the innate immune response in human cells , and their pathogenic potential often correlates with their abilities to inhibit the innate response in vitro ( [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] for review )	1
13902	Pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit antiviral responses despite high levels of replication , whereas nonpathogenic viruses are efficiently recognized and elicit innate responses that limit replication [ 83 , 84 ]	1
13903	This antagonistic capacity must have evolved in the reservoir hosts of these hantaviruses because humans are dead - end hosts	1
13904	To date , few studies have addressed the interactions between @DISEASE$ and their rodent hosts in vitro	1
13905	This is partially due to the unavailability of cell lines , and the reagents and techniques to generate primary cell cultures from the various reservoirs of hantaviruses	1
13906	The Norway rat / SEOV system is the most tractable for studying virus / reservoir interactions	1
13907	Inoculation of rat lung - derived endothelial cells with SEOV resulted in virus replication , but little or no induction of cyt@GENE$ che@GENE$ uggesting SEOV can efficiently antagonize antiviral responses [ 21 ]	1
13908	Despite this , endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD @GENE$ hich correlated with the ability of these cells to induce Treg cell activity	1
13909	In addition , antigen presenting cells isolated from Norway rats and infected with SEOV in vitro were resistant to stimulation , suggesting that virus infection inhibits the normal signaling activities of these cells [ 85 ]	1
13910	Thus antagonism of the innate immune response likely allows for viral replication , while at the same time promotes an anti - inflammatory response that limits immunopathology .	1
13911	Supernatants produced by transient DNA transfection of HEK293T cells were first concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 25 % sucrose cushion , as described in the Methods section , then resuspended and layered onto a linear OptiprepTM gradient ( 5 to 20 % w / v ) prior to ultracentrifugation for 45 minutes at 28 , 000 rpm	1
13912	Fractions collected from the top of the gradient were then precipitated with a final concentration of 10 % TCA and analyzed by WB	1
13913	The intensity of the retrieved bands was quantified by densitometry	1
13914	The amount of CA and @GENE$ present in the different fractions was then normalized to the total amount of CA and @GENE$ present in all fractions ( set to 100 % )	1
13915	Prior to precipitation the density of each fraction was measured using a bench densitometer .	1
13916	Construction of @GENE$	1
13917	For the expression of @GENE$ in E	1
13918	coli , corresponding coding sequences were cloned into the @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( + ) and @GENE$ , or the GST - tag expression vector , pGEX - 4T - 2 , as shown in Table I and Fig	1
13919	1	1
13920	@GENE$ were examined and confirmed by PCR amplification , restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing	1
13921	We successfully produced a set of @GENE$ derived from @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells by using the E	1
13922	coli expression system .	1
13923	Limitations of the software depend largely on image quality ( pixel size ) and the number of frames captured	1
13924	We have used the @GENE$ software to examine @GENE$ files of different lengths , captured at different frame rates ( data not shown )	1
13925	We found that videos captured using high - speed video cameras that capture at rates at least 120 frames per second with a length of 128 frames ( to give a frequency resolution of 0	1
13926	94 ) will give valid data	1
13927	These settings capture an appropriate number of ciliary beat cycles to accurately average the @GENE$ ; the lower the frequency resolution ( that is , the more frames captured ) , the greater the accuracy of @GENE$	1
13928	To allow the videos to be used for beat pattern analysis high - speed video cameras that capture at rates exceeding 250 frames per second should be used	1
13929	The @GENE$ software has the capability to crop frames from large files to speed up the calculation of frequency without reducing the frequency resolution	1
13930	For high - frequency analysis , we recommend that the microscope bulb is connected to a stable power source of at least 110 volt AC / 60 Hz ; lower voltages may cause the bulb to flicker within the @GENE$ range and this will enhance background noise	1
13931	We also recommend that the image is not subject to downstream processing , such as enhanced pixel gain , as this will also enhance background noise .	1
13932	Ethyl ( 2E ) - 4 - oxo - 2 - butenoate ( 62 µl , 0	1

13934	The pulmonary myocardium is a muscular coat surrounding the pulmonary and caval veins	1
13935	Although its definitive physiological function is unknown , it may have a pathological role as the source of ectopic beats initiating @DISEASE$	1
13936	How the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker function is not clearly defined , although recent evidence indicates that changed transcriptional gene expression networks are at fault	1
13937	The gene expression profile of this distinct cell type in situ was examined to investigate underlying molecular events that might contribute to @DISEASE$	1
13938	Via systems genetics , a whole - lung transcriptome data set from the BXD recombinant inbred mouse resource was analyzed , uncovering a pulmonary cardiomyoc@GENE$ coordinately regulated by chromosome 1 and 2 l@GENE$ t analysis and interrogation of publicly available ChIP - seq data suggested that transcription of this gene network may be regulated by the concerted activity of NKX2 - 5 , serum res@GENE$ to@GENE$ ac@GENE$ st - transcriptional level , by RNA binding protein @GENE$ s indicate that this gene network overlaps with molecular markers of@GENE$ t	1
13939	Therefore , we propose that perturbed regulation of this gene network might lead to altered calcium handling , myocyte growth , and contractile force contributing to the aberrant electrophysiological properties observed in @DISEASE$	1
13940	We reveal novel molecular interactions and pathways representing possible therapeutic targets for @DISEASE$	1
13941	In addition , we highlight the utility of recombinant inbred mouse resources in detecting and characterizing gene expression networks of relatively s@GENE$  that have a pathological significance	1

13943	In addition to the potential risks of cross - species transmission from bats to livestock and humans , the infection dynamics of Bartonella in bats are also uncertain	1
13944	In rodents , Bartonella prevalence varies through time [ 39 , 40 ] , but such patterns have not been well studied in bats [ 41 ]	1
13945	Individual heterogeneities in infection by age and sex could also inform exposure patterns	1
13946	Finally , global analyses suggest geographic structure in bat Bartonella genotypes , with notable differences in genotypes from Latin American and those from Africa , Europe , and Asia [ 42 ]	1
13947	However , as such patterns appear driven by bat families restricted to different continents , analyses within narrower geographic and taxonomic ranges could inform the scale of Bartonella transmission and the role that dispersal plays in the spatial dynamics of this infection [ 43 ] .	1
13948	This study analyzed the usefulness of cellular analysis of BAL fluid for predicting the etiology of @DISEASE$ in critically ill adult patients	1
13949	@DISEASE$ in BAL fluid was frequently found in patients with @DISEASE$	1
13950	The degree of @DISEASE$ , which was higher in the @DISEASE$ , was useful for differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
13951	Total WBC count had the best diagnostic accuracy for predicting @DISEASE$ , and its diagnostic performances was better than those of serum procalcitonin and C - reactive protein concentrations	1

13953	OHFV distribution is restricted to western Siberia ( Figure 1 ) [ 17 ]	1
13954	The main vector of OHFV is the meadow tick , Dermacentor reticulatus , which can also transmit the virus to humans	1
13955	However , humans are mainly infected after contact with infected muskrats ( Ondatra zibethicus ) which are very sensitive to the infection and often succumb to the infection [ 63 ]	1
13956	Muskrats develop high viremia which can last for several weeks	1
13957	Human infection occurs through contact with urine , feces , and blood [ 63 ]	1
13958	Secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported but no milk - borne outbreaks have been observed [ 63 ]	1
13959	The exact number of annual cases are uncertain because of misdiagnoses and unreported cases , but 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997 [ 63 ]	1
13960	OHFV may cause a @DISEASE$ ; the initial phase is characterized by @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$	1
13961	Thirty to fifty percent of the cases experience a second phase characterized by @DISEASE$ and reappearance of the symptoms from the initial phase	1
13962	Case fatality rates range from 0	1
13963	5 to 2	1

13965	No antiviral treatments are available against OHFV , instead treatment is focused on supportive care to minimize @DISEASE$ and other complications [ 17 ] .	1
13966	Our results strongly confirm the widely recognized fact that all past and present human and swine H1N1 influenza strains derive from the 1918 strain	1
13967	By extension , this applies to other human @DISEASE$ strains , including H3N2 and H2N2 [ 1 ] .	1
13968	We note that many mutations appeared and disappeared several times over the life of H1N1	1
13969	The data are too sparse over most of the range to know if this is due to repeat mutations at common loci or incomplete genetic sampling of the circulating H1N1 viruses	1
13970	However , over the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak , Kedwaii , et al	1
13971	[ 8 ] demonstrated near - complete lineage loss among the circulating viruses during a single season	1
13972	Bedford , et al	1
13973	[ 33 ] had similar results in their study of influenza A ( H3N2 )	1
13974	It was noted earlier that the phylogeny appears as a main trunk with many short - lived side branches	1
13975	If most mutations are lost from the population quickly , variations that appear several times over the course of H1N1 are most likely due to mutations occurring multiple times in the same place	1
13976	We do not have enough sequence data to get a full picture of strain diversity in most years , but this will be interesting to pursue as more data become available .	1
13977	In this review , we discussed how the respiratory tract is an ecosystem with two niches , the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ ; each with ecological and microbial pressures that determine bacterial selection	1
13978	We hypothesized that viruses influence bacterial selection in the URT leading to colonization of the @GENE$ and sometimes @DISEASE$	1
13979	There appears to be a complex network of interactions among viruses and bacteria in the URT that responds to viral introduction by altering what bacteria are present or modifying their relative abundance	1
13980	For a least one species , S	1
13981	pneumoniae , viruses can increase nasopharyngeal carriage density and increase risk of @DISEASE$	1
13982	Whether this is true for other URT bacteria that cause @DISEASE$ is uncertain	1
13983	We also proposed that bacterial selection in the LRT could be @GENE$ red by viral infection	1
13984	The LRT is normal@GENE$ nhabited by low density of microbes , a state maintained by local host defenses and bacterial mechanisms of evasion	1
13985	In vitro and in vivo studies suggest viruses can promote entry and colonization of the LRT for selec@GENE$ cterial species via a range of biological mechanisms including URT biofilm dispersion , increased bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cell by upregulation of cell receptor@GENE$ monary clearance , impairment of multiple components of the innate immune response and changes in inflammatory response	1
13986	Although there are limitations in interpreting the results of experiments , evidence of numerous mechanisms observed under various conditions strongly suggest that viruses also play an important role in the selection of bacteria in the LRT and @DISE@GENE$  etiology .	1
13987	T Target copy number and R Reference gene copy number .	1
13988	ELISA is appropriate as a screening tool , as it is 10 - fold more sensitive than IFA	1
13989	However , it may cross - react with @GENE$ , so a spike protein - specific IFA is required for confirmation	1
13990	PRNT is a definitive test when ELISA and IFA have inconclusive results [ 25 ]	1
13991	Only 10 % of ELISA - positive results are positive on a neutralization assay [ 25 ]	1
13992	In our study , 1 of 7 patients with borderline or positive ELISA results also had positive results in PRNT	1
13993	Therefore , the results obtained in our study are accurate because ELISA , IFA , and @GENE$ were used .	1
13994	In summary , if in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns found in this study match in vivo resistance patterns , it can be concluded that the antibiotic resistance levels have possibly crossed the danger line for K	1
13995	pneumoniae , Streptococcus species , E	1
13996	agglomerans , and H	1
13997	influenzae , although S	1
13998	pneumoniae still exhibits sensitivity to a good number of antibiotics	1
13999	It should be mentioned here that two isolates of S	1
14000	pneumoniae from asymptomatic @DISEASE$ participants showed an antibiotic sensitivity pattern similar to that of S	1
14001	pneumoniae isolates from symptomatic children ( data not shown ) .	1
14002	Information on seasonal variability would be helpful to create an extra awareness among the community and health professionals including physicians and nurses	1
14003	Preventive measures including personal and in - house hygiene and cleanliness , and proper ventilation may be adopted across the peak @DISEASE$ season	1
14004	Other preventive measures include avoiding crowded public places and making a habit of frequent hand washing etc	1
14005	Our data demonstrate that the majority of 200 symptomatic specimens were collected between August and February corresponding to post - monsoon and winter	1
14006	In this region , the temperature mostly remains low in these months and it is commonly known that @DISEASE$ incidence rate is higher in winter	1
14007	Winter season has bad reputation not only for @DISEASE$ caused by a large number of viruses but also for @DISEASE$ including @DISEASE$ [ 17 , 18 ]	1
14008	Our study demonstrates that the most predominantly detected viral pathogen HRV was circulated throughout the year without showing any clear seasonal distribution	1
14009	On the other hand , the peak circulation of the second most prevalent viral pathogen RSV was seen in September	1
14010	HMPV showed its seasonal peak in January	1
14011	The findings regarding winter seasonality of viral pathogens are thus consistent with previous studies of respiratory viral pathogen detections in Bangladesh [ 10 , 19 ]	1
14012	Similar to the majority of viral pathogens , the bacterial pathogens including S	1
14013	pneumoniae and K	1
14014	pneumoniae , showed their peak circulations in September	1
14015	So , the vulnerable group of children of the country requires appropriate preventive measures against @DISEASE$ across the post monsoon and winter	1
14016	However , this was a one - year study and the time period is meager to substantiate any seasonality of the pathogens .	1

14024	03 and using the same simulated radiograph realizations due to the outbreak , allow us to compare the filtered signals consistently across filters .	1
14025	Our study has a number of limitations	1
14026	We assume that the resulting series { X k , t } , after accounting for these covariates , is stationary	1
14027	We also ignore the fact that an individual may have multiple ED visits	1
14028	Furthermore , these data do not contain any known @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
14029	Instead , outbreak patterns are simulated using a simple stochastic model	1
14030	Although more care needs to be taken when summarizing simulation results , we agree with Buckeridge , et al	1
14031	[ 16 ] and Brookmeyer , et al	1
14032	[ 17 ] that stochastic outbreaks are more realistic than deterministic ones	1
14033	Other results ( not presented here ) indicate that the results are different ( and possibly misleading ) with a smooth deterministic outbreak rather than a stochastic one	1
14034	We utilize the four filters used by Reis , et al	1
14035	[ 2 ]	1
14036	Although filter design is an active area of research , especially in engineering , we decided to only study these four simple and fairly easy to understand filters	1
14037	In the future we could extend our analysis to different choices of filter	1
14038	We view wavelet - based biosurveillance methods [ 1 , 8 ] as extensions of this idea to differen@GENE$ - invariant filters	1
14039	An important issue in filter - based - prediction methods is the choice of covariates and the correlation structure for the time series model	1
14040	Clearly , the properties of the time series model could change with time	1
14041	One way to improve the prediction of outbreak signatures is to use time - varying models , with parameters that slowly evolve over time	1
14042	The use of time - varying parameter models is analogous to a periodic review of the parameter values	1
14043	Window - based estimation methods could be used to re - estimate the model parameters	1
14044	In this case , the choice of window length is critical as it represents a compromise between the efficiency to estimate the model parameters , and the sensitivity and specificity of detection	1
14045	Other issues to be taken into account include negative singularities ( as defined by [ 8 ] ) that can cause a drop in the sensitivity	1
14046	Abnormal points ( like holidays or severe weather ) can cause " false alarms "	1
14047	Our solution to this problem is to jointly model chest radiograph and visit counts	1
14048	So far , we have assumed that the visit counts are observed without error	1
14049	Related to these issues , we are investigating methods that can be used to incorporate the uncertainty in parameter estimation upon the detection procedure .	1
14050	@DISEASE$ causing @DISEASE$ reactivation : a case report	1

14053	get ( id ) ) ; } } Future directions include expanding the applications and releasing packages for use by other programming languages such as Python .	1
14054	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) was identified as a zoonotic virus , whose mode of transmission is from animals to humans	1
14055	The origin of the virus is believed to be bats , from which it was then transferred to camels	1
14056	Camels are currently regarded as a major host for @DISEASE$ CoV	1
14057	It has also been identified as the most significant source for human infections [ 1 ]	1
14058	The isolates of MERS - CoV from camels and humans have also been found to more than 99 % identical [ 2 ]	1
14059	While camels have been identified as the primary source of @DISEASE$ infection through both indirect as well as direct contact , the specific route and role of camels in disease transmission is yet to be identified .	1
14060	Involvement of Autophagy in Coronavirus Replication	1
14061	According to the findings of the present study , @DISEASE$ patients spread @DISEASE$ in the wards and outside	1
14062	The nurses indicated that they feel vulnerable , since they are at great risk of contracting @DISEASE$	1
14063	The nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection , even when they are outside @DISEASE$ wards and that contributes to an outbreak of @DISEASE$ in rural areas	1
14064	The findings of this study concur with those of the study done by Arjun [ 25 ] , which concluded that @DISEASE$ patients are a risk to community members because when they go to shopping centers and places where there are large numbers of people , such as social gatherings and church services they become a danger to the people .	1
14065	Nurse ( N5 ) said : " we do not have essential equipment in the @DISEASE$ wards : UV lights , fans and air - conditioner are not working properly hmmm	1
14066	I do not think they have ever been serviced since they were installed	1
14067	Airflow in the wards is very poor because the wards are too small	1
14068	"	1
14069	The use of @GENE$ or neutralizing @GENE$ to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance	1
14070	For example , administration of @GENE$ to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of @DISEASE$ , whereas antibody that neutral@GENE$ IFNγ impairs CTL responses and clearance , thus leading to persistent infection [ 110 , 111 ]	1
14071	Depletion of immune cell subsets @GENE$ dies can also determine the roles of those cells during infection	1
14072	This approach revealed a critical role for CD4 + T cells for sustaining CTL responses to @DISEASE$ [ 112 ]	1
14073	Other than the Norway rat , an@GENE$ cyto@GENE$ ntibodies for experimental manipulation of the host response of hantavirus reservoirs is substantially limited	1

14080	In the node sampling schemes , a ' sampled ' node has all its edges sampled	1
14081	A node is said to be ' captured ' if it is connected to a sampled node but it has not been sampled itself	1
14082	For all of these schemes , we assume that the total number of nodes N in the network is known	1
14083	We sample a set S of N S nodes and capture N C nodes , the N S sampled nodes plus their connected non - sampled neighbours	1
14084	This method will therefore preserve the degree of the initially sampled nodes N S , but for the remaining nodes that are captured , only the edges that link them to the @GENE$ will be recorded .	1
14085	Data were retrospectively extracted from an ARDSspecific database at our institution	1
14086	Since the electronic patient management system was changed during this time frame , not all required data were available for all @DISEASE$ patients .	1

14101	The sequences of the @GENE$ and probes checked against the @GENE$ are listed in Additional file 7 : Table S4 @GENE$ sequencing and data analysis Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit ( Illumina ) and pair - end sequencing ( 2 × 300 base pairs ) with the @GENE$ Reagent V3 kit ( @GENE$ ) , following the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
14102	The @GENE$ mix was used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and tag with universal adapters in a single tube reaction , followed by 12 - cycle PCR reaction for dual indexing	1
14103	Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) were used for all purification steps and libraries were quantified and quality - checked using the Qubit ( Thermo Fisher ) and	1
14104	A medium sized dataset has been obtained comprising 581 entries pertaining to @GENE$ that were mined from the Uniprot database [ 11 ]	1
14105	4	1
14106	A macro dataset of 909 entries of @GENE$ from all @DISEASE$ has been obtained from Uniprot .	1
14107	The primary objective of this prospective case - control study was to assess the etiology and factors associated with @DISEASE$ in hospitalized children in Mali	1
14108	In this non - PCV population , we observed that S	1
14109	pneumoniae , human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A were the main microbial agents associated with @DISEASE$ among children in Mali , independently of patient age , gender , period , and other pathogens	1
14110	H	1
14111	influenzae was not associated with @DISEASE$ , but the vaccination rate against this bacteria , at least for the first dose , was above 85 % in both cases and controls	1
14112	In addition , while most patients with S	1
14113	pneumoniae by PCR in blood had also nasal carriage , frequently with the same serotype , positive S	1
14114	pneumoniae test from nasal sample was not highly predictive of S	1
14115	pneumoniae detection in blood , meaning that the bacteria was frequently not the cause of @DISEASE$ .	1
14116	Domestic dogs are considered the only known primary reservoir for @DISEASE$ [ 38 ]	1
14117	It has been considered for a long time that cats did not play any role in the epidemiology of @DISEASE$ in endemic areas	1
14118	This view was directed by the facts that , for a long period , very few cases of clinical @DISEASE$ were described in cats as compared to dogs , and that Italy ( Imperia , Liguria ) PCR - RFLP [ 26 ] It@GENE$ na , Sicily ) MLEE [ 10 ] Italy ( Lipari island , Sicily ) MLEE and PCR - RFLP @GENE$ ] Sw@GENE$  PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ ] France ( Alpes - Maritimes ) MLEE [ 12 ] Spain ( Barcelona ) PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ ] Spain ( Madrid community ) PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ , 78 ] Spain a ILMA [ 68 ] Spain ( @GENE$ rca ) b PCR - RFLP [ 95 ] Po@GENE$ sbon region ) PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ , 97 ] Portugal ( Lisbon and Algarve regions ) PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ ] Greece ( Thessaly and Macedonia ) PCR and sequencing [@GENE$ ] Brazil ( Cotia , São Paulo state ) PCR and sequencing [ 100 ] Brazil ( Rio de Janeiro ) PCR and hybridization [ 101 ] Brazil [ 23 ] cats have also been considered more resistant to experimental infection [ 39 ]	1
14119	This interpretation has changed , as the concepts of reservoir and susceptibility in infected hosts are now better understood	1
14120	The majority of infected dogs does not exhibit clinical signs ( at least for a long period ) , although they can be infectious to sand flies and consequently serve as sources of infection	1
14121	During the last two decades , many wild mammals have been diagnosed with @DISEASE$ by serological and / or molecular methods [ 40 ]	1
14122	However , their role as reliable sources of infection ( infectiousness to sand flies , persistent infection ) remains unknown [ 40 ]	1
14123	The recent demonstration that hares can be persistently infected , infectious to sandflies and a reservoir for humans in the absence of participation of dogs in the transmission cycle opens a possible evaluation of the role of species other than dogs in the epidemiology of @DISEASE$ infections in particular scenarios [ 41 , 42 ] .	1
14124	Three - chamber social test	1
14125	The three - chamber social test was performed as described previously 81	1
14126	Briefly , the apparatus consisted of a black Plexiglas rectangular box and two identical clear Plexiglas cylinders	1
14127	There were three interconnected chambers in the box	1
14128	The light was conditioned at 20 lux in an experimental room	1
14129	During the habituation phase , empty cylinders were placed in each of the end chambers	1
14130	A mouse was introduced to the center chamber and its behavioral approach to the end chambers was monitored for 10 min	1
14131	During the sociability test , an unfamiliar male ICR ( CD - 1 ) mouse ( stranger 1 ) that had no prior contact with the test mouse was placed in one of the empty chambers , and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to the empty chamber and stranger 1 was monitored for 10 min	1
14132	During the social novelty test , a new unfamiliar male ICR ( CD - 1 ) mouse ( stranger 2 ) was placed in the third chamber , and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to stranger 1 and stranger 2 was monitored for 10 min	1
14133	The time spent in each zone was calculated using the Ethovision automated tracking program ( Noldus , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) .	1
14134	Birds were challenged via the oro - nasal route with a dose of 10 6 EID 50 / 0	1
14135	1 mL of virus	1
14136	All experimental infections were carried out on birds that were lightly sedated , injecting intramuscularly 150 µL of tiletamine and zolazepam , to prevent that the challenge inoculum was either sucked in or sprayed out by the animal	1
14137	Negative control groups were sham infected reproducing the challenge protocol of sedation but administering 100 µL of negative allantoic fluid .	1
14138	Our eQTL analysis indicates that one of the genes potentially regulated by @GENE$ is @GENE$ , which in turn regulates @GENE$ expression	1
14139	@GENE$ mediates alternative splicing of @GENE$ , resulting in increased expression of the shorter @GENE$ ( increased stiffness ) at the expense of the longer @GENE$ ( Beraldi et al	1
14140	2014 ; Guo et al	1
14141	2013 ; Wyles et al	1
14142	2016 )	1
14143	@GENE$ is also involved in alternative splicing of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( Beraldi et al	1
14144	2014 ; Guo et al	1
14145	2013 ) , and is associated with altered expression of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( Beraldi et al	1
14146	2014 )	1
14147	These changes in gene expression could be due to alternative splicing of @GENE$ , which is likely to regulate the @GENE$ ( Table 4 )	1
14148	In knockout / - down studies , loss of @GENE$ is associated with altered splicing and expression levels of @GENE$ , and the authors conclude that @GENE$ underpins structural and functional development of cardiomyocytes ( Beraldi et al	1
14149	2014 )	1
14150	@GENE$ is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype , is associated with @GENE$ expression , and could be an important therapeutic target in @DISEASE$ .	1
14151	Antibody in genital tract secretions of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals could play a role in facilitating the transport of virus across mucosal epithelia	1
14152	Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of th@GENE$ r @GENE$ n ) in human genital mucosal tissue [ 19 ] @GENE$ n is @GENE$ r belonging to th@GENE$ y of proteins [ 20 , 21 ]	1
14153	The expression o@GENE$ n in endothelial cells is thought to be critical fo@GENE$ G homeostasis in blood [ 22 ] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transportin@GENE$ G to the fetal circulation [ 23 ]	1
14154	A characteristic o@GENE$ n is its ability to bind th@GENE$ n o@GENE$ G at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [ 24 ]	1
14155	This pH - dependent binding allows the transport of intac@GENE$ G or o@GENE$ s from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids , for example , cervicovaginal secretions , to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [ 19 ] .	1
14156	For the spread of @DISEASE$ , we consider several potential predictors of global migration , including different logtransformed measures of geographical distance , absolute latitude , air transportation data , demographic and economic data , viral surveillance data , antigenic evolution and sequence sample sizes ( described in more detail in Text S1 )	1
14157	Text S1 also reports the evolutionary and demographic models used in BEAST and describes how phylogenetic uncertainty is approximated during phylogeographic inference .	1
14158	Vero cells were treated with DFMO for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0	1
14159	1	1
14160	After 24 h , 1 / 10th of the cell culture volume was used to inoculate the next virus passage	1
14161	This process was continued for ten passages , at which time RNA was purified from the cellular supernatant , reverse transcribed , amplified using CVB3 - specific primers , and Sanger sequenced	1
14162	Sequences were aligned to @GENE$ and mutants were confirmed by manual chromatogram verification .	1
14163	Bartonella spp	1
14164	are globally distributed bacteria that cause @DISEASE$ in humans and domestic animals	1
14165	Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human @DISEASE$ ; however , the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown	1
14166	Here we studied the genetic diversity , prevalence of infection across seasons and years , individual risk factors , and possible transmission routes of @DISEASE$ in populations of common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) in Peru and Belize , for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported	1
14167	Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a @GENE$ PCR - positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico , other Neotropical bat species , and streblid bat flies	1
14168	Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America , implying limited spatial structure	1
14169	Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites	1
14170	The odds of @DISEASE$ infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of @DISEASE$ , but nearly all infected bats were infested , which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector - borne transmission	1
14171	While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat sal@GENE$ amples , we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces , suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact ( i	1
14172	e	1
14173	, biting ) and environmental ( i	1
14174	e	1
14175	, fecal ) exposures	1
14176	Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact , environmental , and vector - borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures .	1
14177	Several tests are available for determining the primary and secondary products of lipid oxidation	1
14178	From the most recent works published in scientific journals about the antioxidant activity of essential oils , it is possible to register such diversity on the evaluation of the antixodant activity of essential oils .	1

14181	The evaluation of the antioxidant activities of essential oils from Capparis spinosa L	1
14182	and Crithmum maritimum L	1
14183	from Dalmatia ( Croatia ) by different methods , showed that using TBARS method , the oils presented at 1 g / L ( the highest concentration tested ) lower ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation than BHA , but close to that of BHT	1
14184	They also found that the activity was dosedependent	1
14185	The differences of activity of both samples was not significant , although the differences in the chemical composition of the oils were	1
14186	Capparis spinosa oil was predominantly constituted by methyl isothiocyanate , whereas sabinene and limonene were the main components of Crithmum maritimum oil [ 55 ] .	1
14187	PBMCs were treated at a density of 3 × 10 6 cells / mL with 4 μg / mL ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 or an equivalent volume of endotoxin - free PBS and cultured for 24 h in a 12 - well format	1
14188	During collection of the cells , the adherent cell fraction was removed with 0	1
14189	05 % @GENE$ - EDTA ( Gibco ® , Invitrogen )	1
14190	Harvested cells were divided into 3 fractions labeled separately with either @GENE$ ( kindly provided by Prof Mary Tompkins , Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Laboratory , NC State College of Veterinary Medicine , USA ) , @GENE$ ( Department of Pathology , Microbiology and Immunology , University of California , Davis , USA ) or @GENE$ as isotype control ( BD Bioscience , Allschwil , Swizerland )	1
14191	The fractions were subsequently stained with @GENE$ ( BioConcept , Allschwil , Swizerland )	1
14192	Fluorescence data was obtained using the FACSCalibur ® instrument ( Becton Dickinson , Allschwil , Switzerland ) and the CellQuestPro [UNK] software	1
14193	Gates representing lymphocyte and non - lymphocyte populations were set on the basis of forward versus side scatter , and a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the nonlymphocyte gate	1
14194	Data was analyzed with the FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Olten , Switzerland ) , whereby an additional gate was set comprising both lymphocyte and non - lymphocyte populations ( PBMC gate )	1
14195	@GENE$ and @GENE$ expression levels were determined as mean of fluorescence intensity for each gated cell population	1
14196	Identical gates were set for all cats in such a way that they comprise the desired cell populations of each animal .	1
14197	@DISEASE$ of porcine @DISEASE$	1
14198	@DISEASE$ were apically challenged with an MOI of 0	1
14199	1 TCID 50 / cell for 1	1
14200	5 h at 37 ° C	1
14201	Then the virus inoculum was discarded , the NEC apical surface washed three times with prewarmed PBS [UNK] / [UNK] , and the inserts were transferred into new plates with fresh ALI medium in the basolateral chamber for culture at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2	1
14202	Mock infection controls were included	1
14203	After 24 , 48 , and 72 hpi , apical washes and basolateral medium were collected and stored at [UNK] ° C for later titrations	1
14204	RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection	1
14205	An extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for immunolabeling .	1
14206	Compared to normal weight individuals , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ people consistently had a higher prevalence ( Table 3 ) for the single @DISEASE$ , URTIs , LRTIs , as well as the other outcome parameters we looked at with other @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ as the exceptions	1
14207	For @DISEASE$ , only @DISEASE$ subjects had a higher prevalence	1
14208	The @DISEASE$ group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and @DISEASE$ ( Table 3 )	1
14209	The strongest association was seen for @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and accordingly , any @DISEASE$ was more strongly associated with @DISEASE$ than any @DISEASE$	1
14210	Long - lasting @DISEASE$ , frequent @DISEASE$ and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with @DISEASE$ than the individual symptoms	1
14211	Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates	1
14212	Among subjects with an infection , long lasting infections were again associated with @DISEASE$ , reaching significance for any @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( Table 3 ) .	1

14227	Single - cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from all the mice	1
14228	Briefly , the spleens from mice were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS ( R10 ) , then processed with a Stomacher 80 paddle blender ( A	1

14233	The processed spleen samples were filtered through 45 mm nylon filters and then centrifuged at 1 , 500g for 10 min at 4 ° C	1
14234	The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ACK ( ammonium - chloride - potassium ) lysis buffer ZIKA virus prM envelope - based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al ( Life Technologies ) for 5 min at room temperature , and PBS was then added to stop the reaction	1
14235	The samples were again centrifuged at 1 , 500g for 10 min at 4 ° C	1
14236	The cell pellets were resuspended in R10 and then passed through a 45 mm nylon filter before use in ELISpot assay and flow cytometric analysis	1

14239	Five millilitres of blood was also collected into sera tubes at each time point for sera isolation .	1
14240	As there are few pathogenic challenge models for @DISEASE$ , we compared the putative protective nature of the immune responses of the ZIKV - prME vaccine in C57BL / 6 and IFNAR − / − mice	1
14241	Both strains of mice responded with a robust humoral immune response when immunised with ZIKV - prME	1
14242	T - cell responses were also induced , but appear to be more robust in wild - type C57BL / 6 compared with those induced in the IFNAR − / − animals , supporting a partial defect in innate to adaptive immunity transition as expected owing to the knock - out phenotype in the mouse	1
14243	However , based on the induction of antigen specific immunity , the model was useful for evaluation of the impact of the vaccine on both infection and pathogenesis	1
14244	A single vaccination with ZIKV - prME in IFNAR − / − mice was protective against disease and death in this model , including protection of neuro - pathogenes@GENE$ dies directed against@GENE$ igen are thought to have a key role in protection against disease , an idea supported directly by passive antibody transfer experiments in animal models and indirectly by epidemiological data from prospective studies in geographical areas that are prone to @DISEASE$	1
14245	3 , 7 , 8 Although immunisation of IFNAR − / − mice with the ZIKV - prME DNA vac@GENE$ as well as serum transfer from immunised NHPs were protective in this murine model , the IFNAR − / − vaccina@GENE$  opposed to serum - transferred mice exhibited greater control of @DISEASE$ loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis	1
14246	Although additional studies are needed , this result potentially suggests a role for the T - cell response in this aspect of protection in this model	1
14247	In addition , we observed that control IFNAR − / − mice who recovered from challenge remain viral positive by PCR for at least several weeks , suggesting an additional benefit of vaccination in limiting potential sexual or vector borne transmission	1
14248	Our study extends prior findings and supports the potential of vaccination and , in this case this synthetic DNA vaccination , to impact prevention of disease in a susceptible host	1
14249	were maintained in DMEM ( Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ; Gibco - Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin and passaged upon confluence	1
14250	Both ZIKV virus strains MR766 ( a kind gift from Dr Susan Weiss ) and PR209 ( Bioqual , MD ) were amplified in Vero cells and stocks were titred by standard plaque assay on Vero cells	1
14251	Five - to six - week - old female C57BL / 6 ( The Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) and IFNAR − / − ( MMRRC repository - The Jackson Laboratory ) mice were housed and treated / vaccinated in a temperature - controlled , light - cycled facility in accordance with the National Institutes of Health , Wistar and the Public Health Agency of Canada IACUC ( Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ) guidelines .	1
14252	Other @GENE$ from different viruses interact with @GENE$	1
14253	For instance , the @GENE$ from @DISEASE$ that colocalizes and can be coimmunoprecipitated with LC3 prot@GENE$ opically expressed in various @DISEASE$ cell lines	1
14254	59 , 76@GENE$ iral p@GENE$  protein@GENE$ genome @GENE$ liovirus type 1 interact with LC3 - I@GENE$ 78@GENE$ se proteins contain WxxL mo@GENE$ 	1
14255	Neu5Ac seems to be responsible for inducing the conformational change of Ile327	1
14256	@GENE$ CD in complex with diplacone has the same side - chain orientation of Asp291 as in the @GENE$	1
14257	In addition , an extra water molecule ( W1 ) rather than the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of @GENE$ stabilizes the @GENE$	1
14258	Therefore , together with the kinetic inhibition assay , the structure of the @GENE$ suggests that diplacone binds to the same @GENE$ and acts as a competitive inhibitor .	1
14259	PPMO antiviral activity has mainly been exploited against a wide range of non - retroviral RNA viruses	1
14260	In cell culture , @GENE$ were tested against @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 66 , 67 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 67 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 67 ] , @DISEASE$ ( DENV ) [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] , @DISEASE$ ( SARS - CoV ) [ 71 ] , MHV [ 59 , 63 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 72 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 73 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 74 ] , poliovirus 1 ( PV1 ) [ 75 ] , human rhinovirus 14 [ 75 ] , coxsackievirus B2 [ 75 ] , coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) [ 76 ] , Sindbis virus [ 77 ] , @DISEASE$ ( VEEV ) [ 77 ] , EBOV [ 64 , 78 ] , @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) [ 79 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 80 ] , and @DISEASE$ ( FLUAV ) [ 81 , 82 ] .	1
14261	Similar to the other epidemics , people living in poverty were most vulnerable to the effects of the @DISEASE$ epidemic	1
14262	Poverty facilitated the spread of the @DISEASE$ ; thus , interventions aimed at addressing poverty would be most effective in containing further transmission ( Pellecchia et al	1
14263	2015 )	1
14264	Socioeconomic inequality was additionally evident in the Binequitable management of the dead ^ ( Pellecchia , Crestani , Decroo , Van en Bergh , Al - Kourdi , 2015 , p	1
14265	1 ) ( Garbuglia 2016 )	1
14266	While cremation was a less acceptable cultural practice ( Kobayashi et al	1
14267	2015 ) , it was mandated to limit further @DISEASE$ transmission ( Garbuglia 2016 )	1
14268	The new practice seemed to have impacted the economically disadvantaged who could not afford to pay for private burial services instead of cremation , aggravating socioeconomic divides ( Garbuglia 2016 ) .	1
14269	Specific @GENE$ : The chicken egg yolk is a source of large quantities of relatively inexpensive @GENE$ [ 2 ]	1
14270	Several studies reported that specific @GENE$ provide protection against @DISEASE$ in pigs [ 111 ]	1
14271	Despite the effectiveness of this practice , we have not found in the recent literature ( last 5 years ) any studies evaluating the use of specific egg yo@GENE$ SEASE$ control	1
14272	This is probably the consequence of the non - profitability in pig production of this practice , or the lack of protection against @DISEASE$ challenge or @DISEASE$ occurrence , possibly b@GENE$ antibodies contained in the eggs are not specific against the infected ETEC strains present on the farm [ 143 ] .	1
14273	Organic acids such as citric , fumaric , lactic , propionic , benzoic and formic acids showed beneficial effects in the pig gastrointestinal tract	1
14274	In fact , the use of organic acids in weaned piglets was associated with a reduction of stomach pH [ 118 ]	1
14275	With this effect , organic acids generate a hostile gastric environment for bacterial survival	1
14276	Moreover , organic acids promote the conversion of @GENE$ into pepsin in the stomach of pigs , and promote the activity of this enzyme [ 108 ]	1
14277	On the other hand , decreasing the intestinal pH is probably not a primary effect of feeding organic acids in pigs	1
14278	Indeed , Risley et al	1
14279	[ 119 ] reported a non significant decrease in the pH of the small intestine in 3 - week - old weanling pigs fed with a diet supplemented with 1	1
14280	5 % fumaric or citric acid	1
14281	Addition of organic acids to weaned pig diets improved growth performance and health [ 31 ] as well as the local immunity in the jejunum epithelium [ 120 ]	1
14282	It was reported that regardless of the organic acids used in the feed , these compounds reduced the incidence and severity of @DISEASE$ in pigs , and improved the performance of the treated group compared to that of the negative control group [ 121 ] .	1
14283	RNA binding by the @GENE$ was investigated using EMSAs	1
14284	A short ( @GENE$ ) @GENE$ encompassing the minimal @GENE$ was incubated with @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( or @GENE$ ) or both proteins , prior to electrophoresis on a 4 % non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel	1
14285	As shown in Figure 4A , a single @GENE$ was observed , the formation of which required both @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( or @GENE$ )	1
14286	Using a broader range of @GENE$ concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1 [UNK] , the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM ( Supplementary Figure S3 )	1
14287	In the presence of @GENE$ , the @GENE$ mutant of @GENE$ was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the @GENE$ rotein , b@GENE$ mutant gave a smeary pattern , indicative of weak , non - specific , RNA binding ( Supplementary Figure S3 )	1
14288	As a control , a version @GENE$  probe mutated @GENE$ re@GENE$  ( CC2 , Ref	1
14289	18 ) was also tested , and no nsp1@GENE$  PCBP2 binding was evident ( Supplementary Figure S3 )	1
14290	A supershift assay was carried out to c@GENE$  [UN@GENE$ d PCBP association with the RNA in the complex@GENE$ SV RNA was incubate@GENE$  [UN@GENE$  PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA	1

14293	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( CSFV ) is involved in the RNA synthesis and viral replication	1
14294	However , the NS5A - interacting@GENE$ V replication are poorly defined	1
14295	Using yeast two - hybrid screen , the eukaryotic elongat@GENE$ ti@GENE$ o be an NS5A - binding par@GENE$	1
14296	The NS5A - eEF1A interactio@GENE$ nfirmed by coimmunoprecipitation , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays	1
14297	The domain I of eEF1A @GENE$  to@GENE$ itical for the NS5A - eEF1A interactio@GENE$ expression of eEF1A suppressed t@GENE$ V growth markedly , and conversely , knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the@GENE$ replication significantly	1
14298	Furthermore , eEF1A , as well as@GENE$ , was found t@GENE$ uce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry sit@GENE$ n @GENE$ e - dependent manner , as demonstrated by luciferase reporte@GENE$ treptavidin pulldown assay revealed that eEF1A could bind t@GENE$ CSFV IRES	1

14300	where C i is the total indoor concentration ( µg m - 3 ) of the pollutant in question , C a is the concentration in the intake air , P is the probability of the pollutant remaining suspended after penetrating through the building envelope , α is air exchange rate ( h - 1 ) , k is the deposition rate of the pollutant indoors ( h - 1 ) , G is the indoor generation level ( µg h - 1 ) , V is the volume and t is the temperature of the indoor space	1
14301	The third term covering the transient impacts of changing concentration can be considered zero for the sake of long - term average exposures	1
14302	Detailed input data and more details of calculations are presented in Hänninen and Asikainen ( 2013 ) [ 16 ] .	1
14303	Particulate matter , mainly coming from outdoors to indoors , is the main cause of health effects of indoor exposures in all European countries .	1
14304	In case 2 and 3 , it was assumed that the moving person would walk through the aisle at a constant speed during each cough of the index patient	1
14305	However , all of the three movement behaviors ( moving speed of 0 , 0	1
14306	5 and 1	1
14307	0 m / s during each cough ) might happen during the flight and the movement of the moving person may not be so frequently	1
14308	To verify whether a combination of case 1 ~ 3 may be more likely to happen in the real case , a range of combinations of case 1 ~ 3 are also investigated in the likelihood analysis according to Eq	1

14318	LC - MS / MS data were acquired using a Thermo Scientific LTQ - FT mass spectrometer , which was equipped with a Thermo Scientific EASY - Spray Ion Source , EASY - Spray PepMap C 18 Column ( 3 µM , 100 Å ) , and Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC System .	1
14319	Three hundred and twenty - four NPA aliquots were stored beyond 3 months at 2 to 8 ° C before analysis in Nepal	1
14320	Of these , we re - analyzed the 133 that yielded a negative result , now using the aliquot that had been frozen at - 70 ° C and transported on dry ice to Norway	1
14321	This was done at the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control , University Hospital of North Norway , Tromsø , Norway , using the Hexaplex Plus assay and an automated extraction platform ( NucliSens ® easyMAG , bioMérieux , Durham , NC , USA )	1
14322	@GENE$ were extracted from 400 μl of sample , negative and positive processing controls and amplification control using the extraction principle with magnetic particles of this platform .	1
14323	When counting the episodes for the outcome indicator " ≥ 3 long lasting infections " , different infection symptoms were counted as separate episodes , even if they overlapped in time	1
14324	However , within one symptom category at least one month without this specific infection was required to call it a new episode	1
14325	We also calculated a monthly diary @GENE$ score , averaging the ten @GENE$ symptom categories with the coding " 0 " for " no infection reported " , " 1 " for " reported infection with duration < 2 weeks " , and " 2 " for " reported infection present with duration > 2 weeks "	1
14326	Missing values for individual infection items were treated as zero	1
14327	If an individual @GENE$ symptom was reported , but information on duration was missing , it was counted as " reported infection with duration < 2 weeks "	1
14328	If all items were missing , no diary score was computed	1
14329	The diary @GENE$ score at the monthly level was expanded to a score at the seasonal level by averaging over the six months ( November - April ) of each season , and to an overall score at the individual level by averaging over all available months	1
14330	The respective upper 10 % of these diary scores within each month , season and overall served as additional outcome indicators .	1
14331	Several experimental studies have tried to reproduce the clinical presentations observed in the field , but mortality and severe respiratory signs were rarely observed unless the infection was artificially coupled with secondary pathogens such as Escherichia coli , Mycoplasma gallisepticum , Staphylococcus aureus , Haemophilus paragallinarum , Chlamydia psittaci , Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and live infectious @DISEASE$ virus vaccine [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] or in the presence of an immunocompromised flock [ 16 ]	1
14332	In our opinion , these data together with the lack of ad hoc restrictive control measures and in - depth diagnostic analyses during outbreaks , have somehow mitigated the perception of H9N2 viruses as primary pathogens of poultry .	1
14333	• I believe the abstract would benefit from a little editing	1
14334	At present , the Background section feels unnecessarily long and there isn ' t enough detail in either the Methods or Results sections	1
14335	The methods used for the health impact calculations aren ' t mentioned at all , despite being key to the paper	1
14336	At the moment , I don ' t feel the main results are clearly stated in the abstract .	1
14337	Cellular @GENE$ expression is under the control of multiple @GENE$ , which work cooperatively to form a large @GENE$	1
14338	43 In particular , @GENE$ and @GENE$ are two @GENE$ that are primarily activated by RLR signaling	1
14339	@GENE$ has previously been shown to have no influence on @GENE$ activation induced by Sendai virus infection	1
14340	22 However , it remains to be seen whether the @GENE$ could preferentially inhibit @GENE$ and @GENE$ signaling after @GENE$ activation	1
14341	To address this issue , two different @GENE$ , in which tandem copies of either @GENE$ were inserted into their @GENE$ , were used	1
14342	The truncation mutant of @GENE$ known as @GENE$ that contains only the @GENE$ was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways	1
14343	28 The @GENE$ was able to suppress the promoter activity of the @GENE$ in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 2A ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , but no inhibitory effect was observed with the @GENE$ ( Figure 2B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) although the canonical inhibitor @GENE$ could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2 )	1
14344	Hence , the suppressive effect of the @GENE$ is specific for @GENE$ signaling but not @GENE$ activation .	1
14345	Both Diet A and Diet B are categorized as therapeutic gastrointestinal diets designed to manage non - specific @DISEASE$	1
14346	Although both diets share similar indications , there are nutritional differences between the two diets that are worth considering	1
14347	The macronutrient distribution of protein , fat , and carbohydrate differed between the two formulas	1
14348	The percent of calories from protein , fat , and carbohydrate were 31 , 31 , and 38 % in Diet A and 35 , 40 , and 25 % in Diet B , respectively ( Table 1 )	1
14349	While protein level was similar between the two formulas , the fat and carbohydrate contents varied more widely	1
14350	Reduced dietary fat has been recommended in patients with @DISEASE$ due to potentially impaired fat absorption ( 7 , 8 ) ; however , dietary fat was shown to have no difference in clinical response in cats with @DISEASE$ ( 6 )	1
14351	The presence of concurrent @DISEASE$ has also been an indication for feeding reduced or moderate fat diets in cats with @DISEASE$ ( 17 ) ; however , cats with increased fPL levels were excluded from this study	1
14352	@DISEASE$ was previously rep@GENE$ d in cats with @DISEASE$ , but dietary carbohydrates were not shown to negatively impact clinical signs ( 18 )	1
14353	The higher dietary carbohydrate content of Diet A , relative to Diet B , did not appear to negatively impact diet performance and was well tolerated .	1

14363	@GENE$ binding levels in seminal and CVL fluids were quantified by ELISA	1
14364	Detergent - solubilized @GENE$ from HIV - 1 US657 was captured by a @GENE$ ( D7324 , Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd )	1
14365	Sample @GENE$ and an @GENE$ ( b6 ) were serially diluted , added to wells , washed , and detected by @GENE$ Sigma - Aldrich , A6029 ) antibody	1
14366	Plates were subsequently developed , stopped , and read at OD 450 nm	1
14367	The concentrations of @GENE$ in the seminal and CVL @GENE$ samples were calculated using the @GENE$ and are reported as a percent of total @GENE$ in each sample .	1
14368	@DISEASE$ ( MERS - CoV ) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe @DISEASE$	1
14369	1 Since then , this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread , occasionally , to other parts of the world	1
14370	[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] According to the World Health Organization , 1626 laboratory - confirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries	1
14371	10 In particular , 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea	1
14372	10 MERS - CoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses , HKU4 and HKU5 , providing insight on its evolutionary origin	1
14373	11 , 12 MERS - CoV is a polycistronic positive - sense single - stranded RNA virus with a genome of ~ 30 Kb in size	1
14374	The 5 ′ most two - thirds of MERS - CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab ,@GENE$ further cleaved@GENE$ tural proteins , whereas the 3 ′ end @GENE$  structural or@GENE$  - specific proteins	1

14376	14 MERS - CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons ( IFNs ) , including IFN - α and@GENE$ as@GENE$  as in animal @GENE$ ection models	1
14377	[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS - CoV - encod@GENE$ ich directly pert@GENE$ chanisms , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ @GENE$  [ 26 ] lending support to the notion that MERS - CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response .	1
14378	Here we demonstrate the sensitivity and reliability of the @GENE$ method for GMO detection , both with generic and GMO - specific assays	1
14379	The ability to perform reactions in a simple heated block or water bath without the need for thermal cycling makes testing using @GENE$ more accessible .	1
14380	For the reverse transcription , we used the M - MLV RT ( Promega , Dübendorf , Switzerland ) Kit and followed the manufacturer ' s recommendations : @GENE$ ( 50 - 500 µg , Table S1 ) was incubated with 0	1
14381	75 µL of a random hexamer oligonucleotide ( 100 µM ) and H 2 O for 5 min at 70 • C in a thermocycler ( Biometra ; Analytik Jena , Jena , Germany )	1
14382	For the @GENE$ synthesis , 5 µL 5 × buffer , 1	1
14383	125 µL nucleoside triphosphate ( dNTP ) 10 mM and 1 µL @GENE$ ( M - MLV ) was added to a final reaction volume of 25 µL , which was incubated at 37 • C for 60 min	1
14384	The resulting @GENE$ was diluted 1 / 5 and stored at − 25 • C until further processing .	1
14385	Background : Poliovirus , the causative agent of @DISEASE$ , is a human @DISEASE$ and a member of the family of Picornaviridae and among the most rapidly evolving viruses known	1
14386	Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses	1
14387	However , little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of poliov@GENE$ en acquired to date .	1
14388	The main idea of filter - based methods is to create a detection process { D k , t } , for each time point t , which is a weighted average of the diagnostic or syndromic data to be used for the detection of an outbreak signature	1
14389	The weights that appear in { D k , t } are defined using the form of the time series model and a filter , { a l } say	1
14390	Extreme positive values of the detection process at a time point indicate a possible outbreak signature	1
14391	The definition of the detection processes has its origin in process control [ 5 ] , and is popularly used in the context of biosurveillance [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] 6 , 8 ]	1
14392	Naturally , the form of the filter has an important effect in the detection process .	1
14393	The model fit for the data in each city was assessed using diagnostic plots ( time series plots , normal quantile plots , autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots , and the spectral estimates ) of the estimated innovations of the time series component	1
14394	Figure 3 shows some of these diagnostic plots for the Akron data ( the residuals plots for the other cities were similar )	1
14395	Except for a few extremely positive values , the estimated time series looks stationary	1
14396	The normal approximation is good , as evidenced by the straight line on the normal quantile plot	1
14397	The plots of the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations functions of the time series innovations lie inside the dotted confidence bounds for a white noise process ( i	1

14399	, are samples of uncorrelated time series errors ) .	1
14400	The FVA simulation returns the predicted class of every reaction and compound in the model during growth given the input parameters	1
14401	Reactions in the model are classified as forward essential or reverse essential if they are required for growth to occur , with forward and reverse referring to the direction in which the reactions must proceed	1
14402	Reactions that are not essential for growth , but still active , are classified as forward variable , reverse variable , and variable , with forward and reverse indicating when reactions proceed only in a single direction	1
14403	Reactions are classified as blocked if they cannot carry flux under the conditions specified by the user	1
14404	Metabolites in the model are classified as @GENE$ or @GENE$ if their uptake or secretion is required for growth in the input conditions , and they are classified as transported if they can be taken up or secreted but are not essential for growth	1
14405	In addition to classifying the reactions and compounds in the model , the FVA simulation returns the maximum and minimum values for the flux through each reactions and the uptake / secretion of each metabolite .	1
14406	Hsu cells ( Culex quinquefasciatus cell line ) were infected with @DISEASE$ ( NY99 - 4132 strain ) at multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 and total RNA was collected at 48 h post - infection ( hpi ) for high - throughput transcriptome sequencing as given in Methods	1
14407	The experiment was conducted in duplicate and since Pearson correlation coefficients of 0	1
14408	994 ( control ) and 0	1
14409	991 ( WNV ) indicated close agreement between the biological replicates ( S1 Table ) , data from the replicates was combined for further analysis	1
14410	The raw sequencing and downstream files were deposited at NCBI with accession code GSE60229 .	1
14411	The growth in the number of sequenced @GENE$ has exceeded the most ambitious past estimations [ 1 , 2 ]	1
14412	Today , tens of thousands of @GENE$ are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [ 3 , 4 ] , and whole - genome sequencing / re - sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior	1
14413	In some fields , researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [ 5 ] to explore microbial diversity , while elsewhere , hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation , to support pangenome reconstruction [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] , and to build maps of microbial variomes [ 9 ]	1
14414	Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems , including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats , such as the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ [ 10 ] , the 2009 @DISEASE$ virus [ 11 , 12 ] , and the 2011 German @DISEASE$ outbreak [ 13 , 14 ] .	1
14415	Our first example script takes a command - line argument containing a single ID and produces a table for all assertions of functions for @GENE$	1
14416	Each ID in the input is associated with the name of the @GENE$ containing it , the function for that ID , the source of the functional assignment assertion , and an indication of whether the source of the assertion provided a confidence for their estimate	1

14422	In pteropid bats , immunological stress was suggested as a contributing factor in henipavirus shedding [ 41 ]	1
14423	As described earlier , Sohayati et al	1
14424	[ 41 ] suspected that the recrudescence of @DISEASE$ infection was triggered by waning antibody levels and an increased level of stress due to a combination of factors such as confinement in a cage , and physiological and behavioral changes during breeding season .	1
14425	Briefly , the expression of @GENE$ or @GENE$ was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside ( IPTG ) ( catalog no	1
14426	ST098 ; Beyotime , Shanghai , China )	1
14427	The bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1 mg / mL protease inhibitor cocktail ( catalog no	1
14428	11873580001 ; Roche , Penzberg , Germany ) , followed by mild sonication	1
14429	Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at 10 , [UNK] for 20 min	1
14430	Subsequently , the soluble @GENE$ or @GENE$ was incubated with the glutathione - Sepharose 4B resin for 4 h at 4 [UNK] C	1
14431	The resins were washed four times with cold PBS and incubated with 300 µL of the lysate of the HEK293T cells transfected with @GENE$ for 2 h at 4 [UNK] C	1
14432	After an extensive wash with PBS , the bound proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) followed by immunoblotting using the @GENE$ ( 1 : 1000 ) ( catalog no	1
14433	M4439 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( 1 : 2000 ) ( catalog no	1
14434	AB101 ; Tiangen , Beijing , China ) .	1
14435	Other than @DISEASE$ , the @DISEASE$ and the BCG inoculation site @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , no other features of @DISEASE$ were present in the patient	1
14436	The clinical symptoms and signs resolved without @DISEASE$ specific therapy , with no @DISEASE$ detected on follow up	1
14437	@DISEASE$ is an @DISEASE$ of unknown etiology , occurring mainly in children [ 13 ]	1
14438	As there are no confirmatory tests , the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ is made based on the presence of @DISEASE$ lasting for 5 days or more , and 4 of 5 principal clinical criteria that include conjunctivitis without @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 13 ]	1
14439	A major challenge in the diagnosis and management of @DISEASE$ , however , is the recognition that some infants present with only 2 - 3 clinical features , and therefore do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria	1
14440	Laboratory investigations may be of some use in this situation of @DISEASE$ [ 13 ]	1
14441	BCG reactivation has repeatedly been described as an imp@GENE$ nt sign in @DISEASE$ , although it is not included in any of the diagnostic algorithms [ 14 , 15 ]	1
14442	For example , in South Korea , 85 % of children aged < 1 year who were diagnosed with @DISEASE$ had @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ formation at the BCG inoculation site [ 16 ]	1
14443	The unexpected finding of BCG reactivation in our patient correctly raised the concern@GENE$ a possible diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
14444	Although echocardiography was not performed in the initial phase , no additional supporting clinical or laboratory criteria , other than mild @DISEASE$ , were found	1
14445	Reassuringly , the rapid resolution of symptoms precluded any further concerns with regard to the need for @DISEASE$ therapy in the patient .	1
14446	The concept of using clinically available drugs to treat new diseases is known as repurposing	1
14447	In this method , a new target profile is created for the existing drugs through screening of large molecular databases	1
14448	Owing to advances in computational approaches and development of effective antiviral agents , repurposing has become faster	1
14449	Using high - throughput screening , researchers have been able to screen large libraries of drugs against novel targets and evaluate their antiviral activity in vitro [ 62 , 63 ]	1
14450	Some of repurposed drugs have shown potent antiviral activity against MERS - CoV , for example , ribavirin , nitazoxanide and hexachloropene [ 64 ]	1
14451	Some other studies have repurposed the drugs by using a combination of two or more existing drugs	1
14452	Wilde et al	1
14453	combined alisporivir with ribavirin for enhanced antiviral activity against MERS and SARs - CoV [ 65 ]	1
14454	In another study on @DISEASE$ infected marmosets , hybrid of ritonavir / lopinavir and I@GENE$ ad positive effect [ 66 ] .	1
14455	The main reason why patients should be admitted at the hospital is that they should be provided with quality care by healthcare professionals to recover well	1
14456	However , there are challenges that impact quality of care	1
14457	The following sub - themes will be discussed ; adherence to treatment , delay in diagnosis , lack of equipment and working resources , and lack of enough skills and in - service training .	1
14458	A good working environment can facilitate better service and reduce workload	1
14459	A disorganized working environment impairs the health center teams	1
14460	Infrastructure includes attention to space , ventilation , comfort , and rational layout that facilitates links within the healthcare settings	1
14461	The workplace has an impact on preventing @DISEASE$ transmission ; it serves as the first line of defense for preventing the spread of @DISEASE$ in the healthcare settings	1
14462	Participants expressed similar sentiments about poor infrastructure .	1
14463	In this review , we examine two hypotheses that argue the etiology of @DISEASE$ is a consequence of ecologic selection influenced by the interaction of respiratory viruses and bacteria within the host : ( i ) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of @DISEASE$ by altering bacterial carriage structure in the upper respiratory tract ( URT ) and ( ii ) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT	1
14464	We begin by describing the normal processes of bacterial selection in the upper and LRTs and then present evidence on how these processes can potentially be altered by respiratory viruses .	1
14465	Monocytes and PBLs were purified from the blood of healthy donors by successive Ficoll and Percoll gradients followed by negative depletion ( Miltenyi and [ 39 ]	1
14466	Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages ( MDM ) or DCs with @GENE$ or @GENE$ for 4 to 6 days ( AbCys ) , while PBLs were activated with @GENE$ ( 150 U / mL , AIDS Reagents and Reference Program of the NIH ) and @GENE$ ( 1 μg / mL , Sigma )	1
14467	For replicative infections , cells were challenged with an MOI of 0 , 1 of ADA	1
14468	Every 3 - 4 days aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested and replaced with fresh media	1
14469	The extent of viral replication in the cell culture was measured by @GENE$ activity .	1
14470	No bacterial growth was detected in the oviduct swabs of birds sampled on 4 , 6 and 10 days pi , except for one subject on day 4 pi , in which we recorded the presence of few colony forming units ( cfu ) of E	1
14471	coli and a low load of Gallibacterium anatis	1
14472	@DISEASE$ and M	1
14473	gallisepticum were investigated through PCRs and all oviduct samples resulted negative for @DISEASE$ @GENE$ ce of @DISEASE$ an@GENE$ in the oviducts was ruled out , as all of the swabs were negative by means of RRT - PCR .	1
14474	The spread of this @DISEASE$ virus beyond the respiratory and digestive districts and its high tropism for the infundibulum called for an in - depth analysis of the virus phenotype	1
14475	Firstly , we evaluated the timing and routes of viral spread to the organs by RRT - PCR analysis of both the cellular and non - cellular fractions of the blood but we could not de@GENE$  RNA	1
14476	Even though we consider these negative results as the possible consequence of both a suboptimal sensitivity of the molecular techniques applied and the limited sampling times , we should also consider that H9N2 viruses have been rarely detected in the blood of chickens [ 39 , 40 ] , either in the presence of a S	1

14484	To assess in detail the effects of rVV - HCV immunization on HCV protein clearance from the livers of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , we monitored the levels of @GENE$ in liver samples via ELISA	1
14485	We found that within 28 days after immunization the @GENE$ levels were significantly lower in livers of rVV - N25 - treated mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3A )	1
14486	Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that , within 28 days after immunization , levels of @GENE$ were substantially lower in the livers of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3B )	1
14487	Importantly , neither resolution of @DISEASE$ nor reduction in the HCV prot@GENE$ as observed in the mice treated with LC16m8 , rVV - CN@GENE$  - CN@GENE$ results indicated that HCV nons@GENE$  important for effects of therapeutic vaccines	1
14488	In contrast , rVV - CN@GENE$ coded HCV stru@GENE$ show any significant effects	1
14489	These results indicated that HCV stru@GENE$ ve inhibited the therapeutic effects of the non - st@GENE$ ore , it may be important to exclude the HCV stru@GENE$  5@GENE$ igeni@GENE$ eloping therapeutic vaccines against @DISEASE$ .	1
14490	Virus - infected or mock - infected cells were collected at various times after EV - D68 infection and washed once with PBS as previously described ( Yu et al	1
14491	)	1
14492	The following @GENE$ were used in Western blot analyses : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( Santa Cruz ) , and @GENE$ ( GenScript )	1
14493	@GENE$ from mouse or rabbit were obtained from Jackson Immuno Research .	1
14494	Surgical removal of @DISEASE$ ( performed in two cats ) was followed by relapsing of @DISEASE$ [ 36 , 51 ] .	1
14495	There are two main reasons for employing preventive measures against @DISEASE$ infection in a susceptible animal host and suspected reservoir such as the cat : 1 ) to protect the single animal from the risk of developing a clinical disease ; 2 ) and to contribute to the reduction of the prevalence of infection in a geographic area	1
14496	However , it should be also pointed out that the epidemiological role of the cat as a main reservoir for @DISEASE$ species has not been confirmed [ 34 ] .	1
14497	Here we present memory consumption of HFold , Iterative @GENE$ and @GENE$ on our HK - PK @GENE$	1
14498	Since @GENE$ predicts and keeps about 20 structures in memory , its memory consumption can vary significantly from one sequence to another , and is not predictable .	1
14499	Bats provide vital ecological and economic services , most notably pollination of fruit crops , forest regeneration through seed dispersal , suppression of insect pests that damage crops and vector human diseases , and primary suppliers of nutrients ( guano ) in cave ecosystems [ 55 ]	1
14500	Yet human pressures on bat populations are manifold , with rapid land conversion from urban encroachment and agricultural intensification contributing to rapid declines in bat populations globally [ 3 ]	1
14501	Human pressures are magnified further by overexploitation through unregulated hunting for consumption , inclusion in medicinal remedies ( e	1
14502	g	1
14503	, @DISEASE$ ) [ 56 ] , sport [ 57 ] , and the souvenir trade [ 58 ]	1
14504	In addition to these relatively widespread threats to bats , regional threats also exist that can lead to indirect killing of bats , or persecution and disturbance of roosting bats	1
14505	In Western Asia , widespread application of pesticides to control @DISEASE$ , including spraying in caves and abandoned buildings occupied by bats [ 59 , 60 ] , and agricultural intensification , which has led to the establishment of irrigation systems that deplete available water in this largely arid region [ 60 ] , have contributed to declines in regional bat populations	1
14506	A more recent and unique threat to bats in Western Asia is the fraudulent scheme of selling @GENE$ s " on Facebook and other social media platforms , with sellers claiming the " nests " contain " red mercury " that has healing properties [ 61 ]	1
14507	There are no documented cases of bats building nests [ 62 ] , yet the perceived notion that bats create such economically valuable structures has likely led to increased cave disturbance , potentially displacing or indirectly killing roosting bats [ 61 ]	1
14508	This fraud is speculated to have originated in Iran but has quickly grown in popularity in Jordan [ 63 ] and Turkey , Azerbaijan , and Iraq [ 61 ] .	1
14509	Our unbiased transcriptome analysis also indicated that other genes involved in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ and other @GENE$ , as well as @GENE$ are differentially expressed during @DISEASE$ infection , suggesting that this pathway has a critical role in the invertebrate response to infection and / or the viral host evasion strategy	1
14510	Our results suggest that proteasomal pathway ( and CxCullin4 ) does not play any role in @DISEASE$ entry in mosquito cells ( S5 Fig )	1
14511	This is different than previously reported mechanism in mammalian cells [ 25 ]	1
14512	This may be due to different mechanisms of viral entry in mammalian cells versus mosquito cells	1
14513	It is also interesting that a number of reads from our data did not map to th@GENE$ anscriptome	1
14514	Many of these transcripts may be exp@GENE$ tated genes which contribute to novel host - pathogen interactions in invertebrates .	1
14515	For measuring free radical scavenging ability , the methods are grouped in two groups , according to the chemical reactions involved : hydrogen atom transfer reaction - based methods and single electron transfer reaction - based methods [ 5 ] .	1
14516	Proteasomal / ubiquitylation inhibitors MG132 and PYR - 41 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were used at the described concentrations dissolved in DMSO	1
14517	For controls , cells were treated with DMSO	1
14518	For pre - treatment , cells were initially treated with MG132 , followed by @DISEASE$ infection for one hour	1
14519	This was followed by replacing the medium with medium containing MG132 at appropriate concentrations .	1
14520	In spite of the fact that some authors choose only one method for evauating the antioxidant activity , the great majority prefers to check at least two assays	1
14521	The combinations may include assays for evaluating the ability for inhibiting lipidic peroxidation through the methods reported above and other ones not included in this text and tests regarding the ability for scavenging free radicals .	1
14522	To study the effects of contact tracing and isolation , we modify the assumptions of the SEIR epidemic model , while still incorporating gamma - distributed latent and infectious periods	1
14523	In the new model , isolation of newly infectious cases occurs at a daily rate of d I after a delay of s D days , which represents a period when infected individuals are infectious but asymptomatic or undetectable ( I A )	1
14524	A fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual ( I S ) ( but did not contract the infection ) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class , S Q , where they spend exactly s Q days	1
14525	An identical fraction of newly exposed individuals is also quarantined	1
14526	Full details of the model equations are given in Protocol S1 .	1

14532	The manuscript " Healthy - Polis 1476 - 069X - 14 - S1 - S6 " focusses on the calculation of the annual burden of disease caused by exposure to indoor air pollution	1
14533	This is very important work , given that the indoor environment is greatly ignored in relation to health .	1
14534	If a ubiquitous childhood virus is the cause of @DISEASE$ , the mode of entry would likely be a common mode of infection such as fecal - oral or respiratory spread	1
14535	To note , mild @DISEASE$ have been described in up to 35 % of cases [ 36 ] with rare but more significant @DISEASE$ also being reported [ 37 ]	1
14536	Additionally , outbreaks in the United States have been associated with preceding @DISEASE$ [ 38 ]	1
14537	Notably , however , concomitant respiratory viruses are only shown in 9 % of cases [ 39 ] , and in the same study that showed 35 % with @DISEASE$ , 61 % were noted to have @DISEASE$ .	1
14538	Uncertainties and errors still exist in this work	1
14539	In the risk assessment and the likelihood estimation , an average walking possibility is used for all the seated passengers	1
14540	This is not accurate because each individual may have a unique behavioral characteristic	1
14541	So investigations on behavioral characteristics of the occupants in the airplane are strongly needed	1
14542	And also , only the coughing droplets are numerical simulated in this study	1
14543	Droplets expelled by breathing and sneezing can also influence the infection risk of each individual	1
14544	An aerosol source model that takes the droplets expelled by multiple respiratory activities into account may also be helpful for better evaluating the aerosol disseminate process in the airplane cabin	1
14545	The pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid was considered as constant in this work	1
14546	Since the volume concentration of the virus varies with the size of the cough droplets , changes of the pathogen concentration in the droplets of different size may also influence the risk assessment results [ 50 ]	1
14547	Besides , the re - suspension of the aerosols is not considered in this work	1
14548	During human walking , the movement may lead to the re - suspension of the aerosols from the floor	1
14549	When taking the re - suspension of the exhaled droplets into consideration , the risk assessment results will be more accurate	1
14550	However , since the airflow induced by the ventilation system is downward to the outlet ( located on the side wall and close to the floor ) , the re - suspended aerosols can hardly rise to the breathing level of the seated passengers	1
14551	So the effects of the re - suspended aerosols on the risk assessment results can be considered as insignificant in this case .	1
14552	Management of feline @DISEASE$ has included intervention with both veterinary therapeutic formulas designed to manage non - specific @DISEASE$ and those designed with limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredients for management of food - responsive enteropathies and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
14553	There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline @DISEASE$	1
14554	This prospective , multi - center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non - specific @DISEASE$ in 28 cats with a history of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$	1
14555	The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of @DISEASE$ ( n = 25 ) , with a smaller number having a history of concurrent @DISEASE$ ( n = 2 ) or @DISEASE$ alone ( n = 3 )	1
14556	Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any @DISEASE$ that could be associated with the clinical signs of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , and if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a Spec fPL ≥ 5	1

14558	Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks	1
14559	Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a num@GENE$ reduction in the number of @DISEASE$ episodes over the 4 - week period , but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions	1

14574	Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline @DISEASE$	1
14575	Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2 - to 4 - week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease	1
14576	Keywords inTrODUcTiOn Dietary recommendation for the management of chronic gastroenteropathy in cats has included the use of both veterinary therapeutic elimination and veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 )	1
14577	Veterinary elimination diets are designed to limit dietary antigens by incorporating uncommon or hydrolyzed protein ingredients and are utilized to diagnose and manage gastrointestinal and / or dermatologic conditions with an underlying food intolerance or food allergy	1
14578	Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas differ in that they do not necessarily utilize unique or hydrolyzed protein sources but are designed with highly digestible ingredients to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients within a compromised gastrointestinal tract	1
14579	Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas may also incorporate other dietary modifications such as adjustment of macronutrient distribution , fatty acid composition , and inclusion of dietary fibers and prebiotics	1
14580	While nutritional intervention is commonly utilized to manage chronic gastroenteropathy in cats , there have only been a handful of reported studies evaluating the efficacy of nutritional intervention in naturally occurring disease ( 4 - 7 )	1
14581	Guilford et al	1
14582	showed that 49 % of 55 cats with chronic gastrointestinal disease were responsive to dietary change , and 29 % of the 55 demonstrated a food allergy or sensitivity with recrudescence of clinical signs upon diet re - challenge ( 4 )	1
14583	In another study , eight cats with chronic diarrhea and / or vomiting responded to dietary therapy with a hydrolyzed diet after other medical and dietary interventions were unsuccessful ( 5 )	1

14593	To assess univariate associations of S	1

14595	We used conditional logistic regression for the matched community controls and these analyses were performed with and without additional adjustment for sex ( in addition to the matched variables age and place of living )	1
14596	In a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors of main interest , all potential risk factors plus the potential confounders ( e	1

14599	No model selection such as backwards elimination was performed	1
14600	We included separate effects of exposure to pigs or pork depending on whether the individual had @DISEASE$ or not	1
14601	@DISEASE$ infection occurred predominantly in males but controls were not matched by gender	1
14602	As a sensitivity analysis , we therefore repeated the multivariate analysis including only male cases and controls	1
14603	All analyses were performed with Stata version 10	1

14605	A case - specific review of the literature has demonstrated the influence of power and privilege on the experience of an epidemic	1
14606	In the case of @DISEASE$ in Brazil , the communities most vulnerable to the virus are those with insufficient resources and infrastructure ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 )	1
14607	Consequently , @DISEASE$ has been socially distributed to exacerbate conditions of poverty	1
14608	However , the voices of these most affected people are drowned out by more powerful and prestigious groups	1
14609	This is seen in the comparison that Lotufo ( 2016 ) makes between the politics of @DISEASE$ and the politics of Zika ( Lotufo 2016 )	1
14610	@DISEASE$ research in Brazil procured greater funding because those affected tended to be very notable Brazilians with more dominant social and politics voices ( Lotufo 2016 )	1
14611	The same pattern was reported in relationship to the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Liberia , where weak public health infrastructure aggravated Liberian experiences of @DISEASE$ ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 ; Scott et al	1
14612	2016 ) , while interventions targeted cultural practices , ultimately disempowering the economically disadvantaged ( Garbuglia 2016 ) .	1

14645	Electron micrograph evaluation of autopsy samples from three individuals who had @DISEASE$ revealed ICIs and " virus - like particles " ( VLPs ) [ 103 ]	1
14646	Unfortunately , these three structures all appeared to have different morphologies and variable association with the ICI [ 110 ]	1

14649	Specifically , of @GENE$ ic acid reads done by 454 sequencing , only 1006 did not have significant GenBank homology [ 105 ]	1
14650	This lack of homology to known viral sequences and paucity of unknown sequence is also not supportive o@GENE$ se being VLPs or viral aggregation of an unknown virus	1
14651	The limitation to only autopsy specimens , lack of similar findings in other pathological reports , lack of VLP correlation to ICI , and lack of genetic specificity in the included RNA argues against these being related to the etiology of @DISEASE$ .	1

14679	There are general features that distinguish TBFV from mosquito - borne	1
14680	One such feature is that tick - borne viruses tend to persist in certain stable foci whereas mosquito - borne viruses may suddenly emerge and they can rapidly spread to new areas and continents causing large epidemics [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]	1
14681	Mosquito - borne flaviviruses are transmitted horizontally from mosquito to vertebrate to mosquito , and for some viruses , humans act as the amplifying host [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
14682	Mosquitoes have a short life compared to ticks , as it can take several years for a tick to develop from egg to adult [ 15 ]	1
14683	Ticks also only take one blood meal at each of their life stages , larvae , nymph , and adult , this means that tick - borne viruses need to be maintained in infected ticks during a very long time [ 16 ]	1
14684	Thus , replication in ticks needs to be lower compared to mosquitoes , which have higher viral turnover and a faster generation cycle , this also contributes to the high mutation rate in mosquito - borne flaviviruses , and relative stable genomes of TBFVs [ 17 , 18 ]	1
14685	Infection of @DISEASE$ usually cause a short @DISEASE$ in humans and larger vertebrates	1
14686	This route of transmission has been described as less important in @DISEASE$ [ 19 ] , instead TBEV has been shown to be transmitted by viremic rodents and among co - feeding ticks without viremia [ 20 ]	1
14687	Humans act as dead - end hosts since they do not produce high enough @DISEASE$ to transmit the virus to new ticks .	1
14688	Altogether , our study demonstrates the importance of distinct Treg populations in controlling SR T cells both at the induction and effector site during @DISEASE$	1
14689	These are the	1
14690	The @GENE$ shown in @GENE$ was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 1D )	1
14691	To test our hypothesis that @GENE$ acted as a @GENE$ in the nucleus , we investigated whether @GENE$ could hydrolyze @GENE$ and methylated DNA	1
14692	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ at 10610 24 U / ml started to hydrolyze 0	1
14693	2 mg DNA 1 hr after treatment	1
14694	At a concentration of 8	1
14695	3610 24 U / ml , @GENE$ digested more non - methylated DNA than @GENE$ after 1 hr of treatment ( Figure 6A )	1
14696	In addition , quantitation of nonmethylated and methylated DNA showed a reduction rate of 62 % and 21 % , respectively ( Figure 6C )	1
14697	However , no difference in hydrolysis of non - methylated and methylated DNA was observed when 8	1
14698	3610 24 U / ml @GENE$ was tested ( Figure 6A )	1
14699	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ did not digest DNA at a concentration of 1	1
14700	4610 24 U / ml , regardless of whether it was methylated or not ( Figure 6A )	1
14701	We next tested whether the @GENE$ could digest @GENE$ in the nucleus	1
14702	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were not hydrolyzed by either @GENE$ or @GENE$ at concentrations of 10610 24 U / ml and 8	1

14709	In this review , we summarize the current knowledge of bats as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses that jeopardize public health and food security , yet are threatened by a multitude of human activities that alter host - virus dynamics	1
14710	We highlight that Western Asia is a region with a diverse bat fauna comprising 96 species that overlap at the biogeographic crossroads of Asia , Oceania , Africa , and Europe	1
14711	Through literature searches based on key terms in PubMed , we demonstrate that research on bats and bat - associated viruses is highly fragmented across the region , and severely limited in most countries	1
14712	Challenges due to political instability and resource availability in some Western Asian countries has likely contributed to this limited research effort on bats and their viruses	1
14713	We propose that collaborative scientific research - notably a regional bat research network , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) - could have the ability to rise above such challenges when faced with a common goal and driven by strong network engagement with a mission toward sustainability	1
14714	The @GENE$ Net will facilitate cross - border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations and promote @DISEASE$ outbreaks , and will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host - virus dynamics in other taxa native to Western Asia , in particular known reservoirs of @DISEASE$ ( e	1
14715	g	1
14716	, rodents in Iran [ 155 ] )	1
14717	We strongly advocate a " bats for peace " mission for WAB - Net by pr@GENE$ g data sharing and a culture of meaningful transboundary scientific collaboration to develop a sustainable bat research network and serve as an instrument for the early detection of @DISEASE$ threats in this politically volatile region .	1
14718	Cervicovaginal lavage ( CVL ) and seminal fluid were collected from @DISEASE$ - infected patients and healthy volunteers at the University of Alabama , Birmingham	1
14719	All subjects gave written consent in accordance with an IRB - approved protocol	1
14720	CVL was collected from one 34 year - old uninfected women and from three infected women ( age 29 to 46 years ) wit@GENE$ 4 + lymphocyte counts of 458 / mm 3 , 181 / mm 3 and 498 / mm 3 and plasma viral loads of 14100 copies / ml , 824 copies / ml and 88 copies / ml , respectively	1
14721	Viral loads were not measured in the CVL fluid specimens	1
14722	Two of the women ( with the lower plasma viral loads ) were receiving anti - retroviral therapy	1
14723	Briefly , CVL fluid was obtained by flushing the cervix and vagina with 5 ml sterile saline , and the wash was collected into tubes with protease inhibitors ( [ 73 ] )	1
14724	Seminal fluid was obtained from two uninfected men ( ages 25 and 40 years ) , and from three infected men ( age 43 to 53 years ) by masturbation ( 58 ) @GENE$ 4 counts in the infected men were 404 / mm 3 , 336 / mm 3 and 407 / mm 3 and plasma viral loads were , 100 copies / ml , 8092 copies / ml and 6750 copies / ml , respectively ; only one of these subjects ( with viral load of 11 copies / ml ) was receiving anti - retroviral therapy	1
14725	Seminal fluid was assayed fo@GENE$ A by PCR , but none was detected	1
14726	The cervicovaginal and seminal fluids were centrifuged and supernatant fluids aliquoted and frozen at 280uC until assayed	1
14727	Tota@GENE$ G was determined by ELISA [ 74 ] @GENE$ G isolation was accomplished by incubating samples with Protein G - Sepharose ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences Corp	1
14728	) followed by elution of boun@GENE$ G according to manufacturer ' s instructions	1
14729	Th@GENE$ G preparations were concentrated and dialyzed against DPBS using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units ( Millipore Corp	1
14730	)	1
14731	Th@GENE$ G preparations from the two uninfected men were pooled to obtain sufficient quantity for experiments ; all other IgG preparations were tested individually .	1
14732	Recent outbreaks of @DISEASE$ in humans and domestic animals elevates the viral family Coronaviridae to be of great concern as a likely source of new emerging @DISEASE$ , and a priority for future viral surveillance efforts	1
14733	Based on our current understanding of CoV systematics , all human CoVs have evolutionary origins in wildlife reservoirs , with SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , and human - CoVs NL63 and 229E considered to have originated in bats [ 39 , 124 , 125 ]	1
14734	Moreover , spillover of bat - associated CoVs has occurred into domestic animals , for example SADS - CoV has a 90 % mortality rate in young piglets [ 33 , 124 ]	1
14735	On a global scale , reported CoV diversity mirrored species richness , suggesting regions with greater species richness will also have higher CoV diversity [ 9 ]	1
14736	We found that research effort on bat - associated CoVs was significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis ( r = 0	1
14737	26 , p = 0	1
14738	001 ) ( Table S3 )	1
14739	However , research effort was greatly skewed towards the United States and China ( Figure 6 ) , with 71 % of all other countries reporting no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table S4 )	1
14740	Not surprising , China published the most studies on bat - associated CoVs , which is largely driven by targeted efforts to Figure 5	1
14741	Research effort on bat - associated viruses by country	1
14742	The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " ) AND ( " virus " OR " viruses " ) by country	1
14743	Raw data provided in Table S4 .	1
14744	Limited research effort has implications for assessing the conservation status of bat species in Western Asia and impedes our ability to identify imperiled species	1
14745	A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern ( 77 % ) , and 9 % of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status ( Figure 4a )	1
14746	Yet , population trends for most bat species in Western Asia , including those classified as " least concern , " are largely unknown or decreasing ( Figure 4b ) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation	1

14750	Similar to previous reports , we found a relatively high prevalence of cats that were positive for @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( 15 )	1
14751	Cats with a positive status were included within this study population , receiving dietary intervention alone	1
14752	Similar to a previous report ( 15 ) , a positive status did not correlate with the occurrence of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ over the study period	1
14753	It should be emphasized that the presence o@GENE$ y an@GENE$ e does not necessarily denote infection nor does it indicate the need to initiate medical therapy	1
14754	Similarly , antimicrobial therapy for Campylobacter spp	1
14755	is not recommended in animals that are not immunocompromised or showing systemic signs of illness ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , abnormal leukogram findings ) as it can prolong the carrier state and the @DISEASE$ typically selfresolves with supportive care alone ( 16 ) .	1
14756	Background : Airborne transmission of @DISEASE$ in indoor environment ( e	1
14757	g	1
14758	airplane cabin , conference room , hospital , isolated room and inpatient ward ) may cause outbreaks of @DISEASE$ , which may lead to many infection cases and significantly influences on the public health	1
14759	This issue has received more and more attentions from academics	1
14760	This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of @DISEASE$ in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission	1
14761	Methods : The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols	1
14762	The dose - response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants	1
14763	The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions	1
14764	An in - flight @DISEASE$ outbreak case is used for investigation	1
14765	A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors	1
14766	A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants , which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system .	1
14767	The RT - qPCR was performed in duplicate for each sample using the KAPA SYBR ® FAST Universal qPCR kit ( KAPA Biosystems , Wilmington , DE , USA ) with 12 µL volumes containing 6 µL KAPA SYBR ® ( Wilmington , DE , USA ) green reaction mix , 0	1

14769	52 µL H 2 O and 3 µL diluted @GENE$ [ 52 ]	1
14770	An ECO [UNK] real - time PCR machine ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) processed the reaction at the following qPCR cycling profile : 3 min incubation at 95 • C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 • C for denaturation , 30 s at 57 • C for annealing and extension , and data collection	1
14771	By reading the fluorescence at 0	1
14772	5 • C intervals between 55 • C and 95 • C , a melting curve analysis was performed after the amplification to verify the specificity of the @GENE$	1
14773	On each plate , a ten - folds serial dilution of purified @GENE$ that served as standard curves for DWV and TMV and two no - template negatives were included [ 59 ]	1
14774	From the q - PCR output data , the standard curves and the experimental dilution factors viral titers respectively estimated viral copies per sample were derived [ 60 ]	1
14775	To account for the exponential distribution of the data , virus titers were log - transformed and throughout the manuscript , the logarithmic values of the viral titers are reported	1
14776	Because it is not possible to log transform zero values of negative samples we assigned to them a hypothetical Cq value of 36 , which was transformed to virus titers as above	1
14777	From the averaged value of these " negative titers , " we obtained the titer detection threshold [ 61 ]	1

14780	That @GENE$ is able to detect very small amounts of target and do that even in high amounts of background DNA makes it ideal for GMO detection	1
14781	GMO testing can be performed in steps : routine screening for the presence of GMOs using generic assays such as for @GENE$ and @GENE$ ; and if required , identification of specific events can be performed using event - specific assays	1
14782	Equally , direct screening using event - specific assays is also feasible	1
14783	The levels of sensitivity are orders of magnitude below the permissible threshold for GMO in food and feed ( EC regulation 1830 / 2003 ) , ensuring the detection of the presence of GMOs at acceptable levels and the reliable detection of any presence of unauthorised GM events , for which at present there is no legally acceptable lower limit ( according to EC regulations ) .	1

14802	Although the role of this recombination event between CPV and FPLV in viral pathogenicity is unknown , our preliminary infection studies confirmed the high virulence of this recombinant virus	1
14803	The intranasal infection studies in six 3 - month - old cats with the HN - ZZ1 isolate resulted in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in the affected animals at 2day post infection	1
14804	Subsequently , the cats began to display severe @DISEASE$ and developed watery to @DISEASE$ , which resulted in nearly 100 % mortality in affected cats at 4 - 6 days post infection	1
14805	Gross examinations showed that the affected cats were characterized by mild to severe @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ mucosa , with bleeding spots on the surface of the heart , liver , lungs and spleen ( data not shown )	1
14806	At present , the number of strains from Zoo animals that have been characterized by molecular methods are very limited , as can be observed by the scarce complete VP2 sequences available in GenB@GENE$  emergence and continuous increase of recombinant parvoviruses , our ongoing studies will investigate the geographic distribution of these viruses , monitor their recombination characteristics , identify their virulence determinants by reverse genetics and develop efficient strategies against these novel viruses .	1
14807	Further variables considered in the study were age , gender , self - reported weight and height for BMI calculation ( BMI was categorized as < 30 ( non - obese ) , 25 ≤ BMI < 30 ( overweight ) and ≥ 30 ( obese ) ) , educational level , contact with children , comorbidities , removed immunological organs , smoking status , sports activity and dietary intake patterns	1
14808	Details on these variables are described in the Additional file 1 and supplementary information on dietary intake patterns is presented in Additional file 3 .	1
14809	Genetically , distinct @GENE$ lineages have been described , the G1 being probably the most widespread	1
14810	In fact , H9N2 viruses of the G1 lineage emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 [ 2 ] , and steadily spread to the rest of Asia , reaching the Middle East [ 3 ] and North Africa [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , by the year 2000 and 2006 , respectively	1
14811	In 2016 , the virus severely affected Morocco and , for the first time , was reported in sub - Sahara Africa , being reported in Burkina Faso , in West Africa [ 8 ]	1
14812	In many of these regions , the virus has become an endemic presence notwithstanding the implementation of vaccination , increased biosafety and surveillance measures , and is frequently associated with moderate - to - high mortality in broilers and Open Access * Correspondence : fbonfante @ izsvenezie	1

14814	The remarkable advance in sequencing technology and the rising interest in medical and environmental microbiology , biotechnology , and synthetic biology resulted in a deluge of published @GENE$	1
14815	Yet , genome annotation , comparison , and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge , hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation	1
14816	Among the earliest , most comprehensive resources for @GENE$ analysis , the SEED project , initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools , now contains	1
14817	5 , 000 complete @GENE$ , a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems , a derived set of @GENE$ , and hundreds of genome - scale metabolic models	1
14818	Until recently , however , maintaining current copies of the @GENE$ code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue	1
14819	To allow high - performance remote access to the @GENE$ database , we developed the @GENE$ Servers ( http : / / www	1
14820	theseed	1
14821	org / servers ) : four network - based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database , support basic annotation services , offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the @GENE$ annotation server , and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis	1
14822	The @GENE$ servers offer open access to regularly updated data , the ability to annotate @GENE$ , the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism , and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models	1
14823	This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts	1
14824	Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology , and programmatic access to the @GENE$ data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users .	1
14825	To characterize the @GENE$ in terms of its @GENE$ antagonism , @GENE$ was ectopically expressed in cultured cells for functional assays ( Figure 1A )	1
14826	A @GENE$ driven by @GENE$ was used to reflect @GENE$ activity stimulated during infection	1
14827	Sendai virus was used as a model virus to potently induce @GENE$ expression in transfected cells	1
14828	When increasing doses of @GENE$ were expressed in advance , a dose - dependent inhibition of @GENE$ activity was observed ( Figure 1B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 )	1
14829	A similar observation was also noted when synthetic dsRNA analog poly ( I : C ) was used as an alternative inducer that specifically stimulates the RLR pathway of @GENE$ production ( Figure 1C ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 )	1
14830	These two pieces of data are generally consistent with a previous report , 22 and they further strengthen the current model of the @GENE$ antagonism of @GENE$ .	1
14831	To explore the potential role of @GENE$ in PRRSV @GENE$ , we translated the @GENE$ in RRL reactions supplemented with @GENE$ , @GENE$ , or both proteins ( Figure 3A )	1
14832	We found that @GENE$ alone did not affect @GENE$ EASE$ ( right hand lane ) , but when added together@GENE$ [UNK] , synthesis of th@GENE$ oduct was stimulated some 3 - fold ( see Supplementary Table )	1
14833	We reasoned that if the ' act@GENE$ lat@GENE$ f @DISEASE$ in PRRSV is a@GENE$  nsp@GENE$ K] and PCBP , the RRL system may already contain an abund@GENE$ orm of PCBP , but one which would , in c@GENE$  nsp1 [UNK] , preferentially@GENE$ uce − 2 PRF	1

14836	Consistent with our h@GENE$ hesis , PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addit@GENE$  nsp@GENE$ ] and PCBP2 , with neither protein alone having any frameshift - stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B )	1
14837	Further , supplementation of WG transl@GENE$  with PCBP2 led preferen@GENE$ o a − 1 PRF , w@GENE$ hu@GENE$ 1 , − 2 PRF was most evident ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the abundant for@GENE$ RL is PCBP1	1
14838	We @GENE$ mo@GENE$ huma@GENE$ - RNP K / J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D )	1
14839	Of these three prot@GENE$  only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting , with both @GENE$ RF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C )	1
14840	We confirmed the inv@GENE$ PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured @GENE$ sing siRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S2 )	1
14841	Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF , with PCBP1 noticeably affecting − 2 PRF , and PCBP2 , − 1 PRF , consistent with the results of the WG assays above	1
14842	No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3 , PCBP4 or hnRNP K / J , although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody .	1
14843	Prebiotics are selectively fermented components of feed , indigestible by the host animal , that modulate the gut microbiota to benefit host health	1
14844	Resulting effects include the stimulation of short - chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production and the proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp	1
14845	and Bifidobacterium spp	1
14846	[ 122 , 123 ]	1
14847	Common prebiotics include inulin and oligosaccharides such as galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) and fructooligosaccharides ( FOS ) [ 124 ]	1
14848	Pigs fed with chito - oligosaccharides ( COS ) showed better overall intestinal health ( based on villi height ) , improved performance ( measured by body weight gain and feed conversion ratio ) and higher Lactobacillus counts than those found in control pigs or pigs receiving diets supplemented with chlortetracycline [ 125 ]	1
14849	Also , fermented ingredients , such as non - starch polysaccharide hydrolysis products of soybean meal ( SBM ) in weaned pig feed , were found to interfere with attachment of ETEC to enterocytes and were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during @DISEASE$ infection [ 126 ]	1
14850	It was shown that the prebi@GENE$ nn@GENE$  βGM ) inhibited the in vitro adhesion of ETEC on the cell surface of porcine intestinal IPI - 2I cells , and decreased the @GENE$ uced gene expressio@GENE$ ines suc@GENE$  -@GENE$  -@GENE$  CSF@GENE$ ines on intestinal IPI - 2I cells [ 127 ] .	1
14851	Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) are small molecules constituting an important part of the innate immune system	1
14852	They may present antibacterial , antifungal , antiparasitic , and antiviral activities , and are increasingly of interest as alternatives to classic antibiotics [ 88 ]	1
14853	AMPs such as lactoferrin , cecropin , defensin , plectasin and bacteriocins showed beneficial effects on growth performance , nutrient digestibility , small intestinal morphology and gut microbiota in pigs [ 89 ]	1
14854	Available data on the effect of AMPs on swine health and especially in the control of @DISEASE$ have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 89 , 139 ]	1
14855	Antimicrobial lactoferrin peptides are one of the most commonly used AMPs in pig feeds	1
14856	More recently , it was shown in a murine model of @DISEASE$ that treatment with porcine lactoferrinderived peptide LFP - 20 was effective in the prevention of histological damage , the inflammatory response and the disruption of tight junction structure induced by LPS in the intestine [ 140 ]	1

14859	On the other hand , resistance to AMPs has been observed in vitro in @DISEASE$ such as E	1
14860	coli [ 142 ]	1
14861	Thus , the use of AMPs in pig farms needs careful and controlled implementation to limit possible resistance development and cocktails of AMPs might be useful to mitigate selection for resistance [ 88 ] .	1
14862	The burden of the @DISEASE$ epidemic fell disproportionately on the most disadvantaged Liberians , fundamentally politicizing the epidemic	1
14863	The socioeconomic distribution of @DISEASE$ was political , as defined for the purposes of this review , in that many scholars attribute its emergence to the socioeconomic conditions of Liberia	1
14864	For example , poverty , and subsequent limited investment into the health system led to weak public health infrastructure , insufficient information technologies , a lack of trained personnel , inadequate case reporting , was often cited as the key vulnerability of Liberia ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 ; Scott et al	1
14865	2016 )	1
14866	Additional challenges included mobility of particular populations , authority distrust , economic instability , and a lack of governance ( McNamara 2016 )	1
14867	These challenges intersected with other stressors , such as climate change and @DISEASE$ to intensify the effects of the @DISEASE$ epidemic ( Scott et al	1
14868	2016 )	1
14869	Many rural communities in Liberia were particularly vulnerable , extremely poor , and lacking secure access to food and health clinics ( Scott et al	1
14870	2016 ) .	1
14871	One aliquot of each specimen was tested at our research laboratory in Nepal at the Institute of Medicine , Tribhuvan University , for RSV , InfA and InfB , PIV types 1 , 2 and 3 , and hMPV using a commercially available multiplex @GENE$ transcriptase PCR assay ( Hexaplex Plus ® , Prodesse Inc , Waukeshaw , WI , USA ) with minor modifications of the manufacturer ' s instructions [ 22 ] and according to previous descriptions [ 15 ]	1
14872	In brief , nucleic acids were extracted from 360 μl of @GENE$ ( or @GENE$ from positive control transcripts ) using a nucleic acids extraction kit ( Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit , F	1

14874	Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control ( virus transport medium ) , starting at nucleic acid isolation	1
14875	Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 μl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors	1

14879	After initially holding the PCR mi@GENE$ e at 95 ° C for 10 min , amplification was performed as follows : two cycles at 95 ° C for 1 min , 55 ° C for 30 sec and 72 ° C for 45 sec , and then 38 cycles at 94 ° C for 1 min , 60 ° C for 30 sec , 72 ° C for 30 sec , followed by an additional 7 min at 72 ° C and immediate cooling to 4 ° C	1
14880	After amplification , the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN Inc , Valencia , CA , USA ) and analyzed by enzyme hybridization assay [ 15 ] , measuring the optical density at 450 nm ( OD 450 ) using a micro - plate reader ( Stat Fax ® 2100 , Awareness Technology Inc , Palm City , FL , USA ) .	1

14898	In the risk assessment , an assumed value of 1 was used for the infectivity of SARS - CoV , and average values were used for the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough	1
14899	These average or assumed values might lead to uncertainties in the risk assessment results	1
14900	In the likelihood analysis , all these uncertain variables were included in the quanta generation rate term , while the case that best fits the outcome of the real outbreak case was identified by the MLE [ 49 ]	1
14901	As shown in Table 5 , the passengers are arranged into four groups ( with the index patient excluded ) according to their intake fractions obtained in the exposure assessment of case 1 ~ 3 ( Figure 6 ) , respectively	1
14902	In the outbreak case , 17 of the 71 passengers involved in this investigation region are infected with @DISEASE$	1
14903	They are also given in Table 5 and used in the likelihood analysis	1
14904	By using Eq	1
14905	( 4 ) , the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rates ( 1 ~ 10 9 hr − 1 ) are obtained for case 1 ~ 3 , as shown in Figure 10	1
14906	The estimated quanta generation rate of the index patient in the outbreak case is 0	1
14907	141 million , 0	1
14908	103 million and 0	1
14909	127 million for case 1 ~ 3 , respectively	1

14911	414 comparing with 0	1
14912	026 and 0	1

14914	So case 1 best fits the infection pattern of the real case among case 1 ~ 3 .	1
14915	In the period 2006 - 2010 , focus on indoor air quality has been raised by WHO , who has issued specific guidelines addressing air exposure in indoor spaces [ 1 , 2 ] infections , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and short - term sick leaves ) , and an association between ventilation and productivity ( performance of office work ) was indicated .	1
14916	Due to the counter - acting roles of indoor and outdoor air sources on indoor exposures , a mass - balance model is needed to address it when defining prevailing indoor concentrations	1
14917	A commonly used approach based on Dockery and Spengler [ 14 ] and adopted in Hänninen et al	1
14918	[ 11 ] , [ 15 ] is as follows :	1
14919	Missing rates of single items in the returned diaries were limited and ranged from 1	1
14920	2 % for @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ to 2	1
14921	6 % for other @DISEASE$	1
14922	Study participants reported most frequently @DISEASE$ ( 26	1

14929	9 % )	1
14930	Apart from the LRTIs @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , which more men than women reported , all other @DISEASE$ were more prevalent among women ( Table 2 )	1
14931	Seasonal patterns of reported infections show a February peak for two of the three assessed infection seasons ( 2012 / 13 and 2014 / 15 , see Additional file 5 )	1
14932	@DISEASE$ with a high fraction of long duration were almost exclusively @DISEASE$ , namely @DISEASE$ ( 59 % ) , followed by @DISEASE$ ( 48	1

14937	@GENE$ was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription ( RT ) kit ( Qiagen ) using random hexamers ( Thermo Fisher )	1
14938	RT - quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems )	1
14939	The primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1	1
14940	Fold change of gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle ( 2 [UNK] ) method ( 69 ) , and the @GENE$ was used for normalization	1
14941	Relative gene expression results are presented on a base 2 logarithmic scale .	1
14942	Among seven Himalayan Lauraceae species , only the essential oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora and Lindera pulcherrima were able to inhibit lipid peroxidation , using liver homogenate as lipidic substrate	1
14943	These oils , along with Persea gamblei , were already reported as being potent inhibitors of linoleic oxidation measured through the β - carotene bleaching test [ 44 ]	1
14944	Such activities were independent of the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils .	1
14945	PBMCs were stimulated with ODN 2216 , ODN 2243 or endotoxin - free PBS at a density of 3 × 10 6 cells / mL directly after isolation , while CrFK , FEA or fcwf - 4 cells were cultured to confluency prior to stimulation	1
14946	Experiments were carried out in a 96 - well format	1
14947	For stimulation of adherent cells with supernatants ( production see below ) , total cell culture medium was discarded from the wells and the monolayers were further cultured in 100 μL undiluted supernatants for the rest of the experiment	1
14948	At time points relevant to each experiment , the supernatants were removed and cells were lysed with mRNA lysis buffer ( mRNA isolation kit I , Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland )	1
14949	@GENE$ extractions were performed with the @GENE$ Isolation Kit I and @GENE$ Pure LC Instrument ( Roche Diagnostics ) and first strand @GENE$ was synthesized with the High Capacity @GENE$ Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Rotkreuz , Switzerland )	1
14950	Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) reactions consisted of 5 μL @GENE$ in a total volume of 25 μL per reaction using the TaqMan ® Fast Universal @GENE$ Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems )	1
14951	Thermocycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 20 s at 95 ° C followed by 45 cycles of amplification by melting at 95 ° C for 3 s and annealing at 60 ° C for 45 s	1
14952	Primers and probes for @GENE$ have been previously described [ 58 ]	1
14953	@GENE$ of selected @GENE$ , which correspond to ratios of mRNA levels measured in ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 stimulated versus PBS stimulated cells , were calculated and normalized with GeNorm version 3	1

14960	Peroxidation level evaluation using the ferric thiocyanate During linoleic acid oxidation , peroxides are formed ( primary products of oxidation ) , which oxidise Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +	1
14961	The latter ions form a complex with thiocyanate , and this complex has a maximum absorbance at 500 nm	1
14962	Therefore , high absorbance indicates high linoleic - acid oxidation	1
14963	Using this method , some authors [ 42 ] found that Lavandula angustifolia Mill	1
14964	oil from Australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied	1
14965	Such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate .	1
14966	Peptide - mediated PMO delivery has been the focus of intense efforts to identify active , stable , non toxic and endosomolytic @GENE$ , of which ( RXR ) 4 XB ( also called P7 ; R = L - arginine , X = 6 - aminohexanoic acid ; B = β - alanine ) has proven very successful [ 61 , 62 ]	1
14967	In antiviral studies , PMOs have been covalently linked to various arginine - rich peptides , the most frequent being R 9 F 2 C ( R = L - arginine ; F = L - phenylalanine ; C = L - cysteine ) , R 5 F 2 R 4 C ( also called P4 ) , and ( RXR ) 4 XB	1
14968	Conjugation is mainly at the @GENE$ of the PMO	1
14969	In studies comparing the activity of various @GENE$ against murine @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 63 ] and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 64 ] , arginine - rich peptides with insertions of 6 - aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vi vo effectiveness	1
14970	The higher the number @GENE$ ts , the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [ 63 ] and the protection against @DISEASE$ infection in mice [ 64 ]	1
14971	These findings agree with the results from Amantana et a l	1
14972	[ 57 ] , Abes et al	1
14973	[ 61 ] and Youngblood et al	1
14974	[ 65 ] , who also found that these residues increased serum stability and enhanced endosomal escape of the conjugates	1

14994	These constructs were sequence matched with the original ZIKV - MR766 isolate or a recently circulating ZIKV strain from Brazil , respectively	1
14995	While supportive , further study will provide more insight into the effects of such incorporated designed changes on induced immune responses .	1
14996	Flow cytometry and intracellular @GENE$ staining assay The splenocytes were added to a 96 - well plate ( 2 × 10 6 / well ) and were stimulated with ZIKV - prME pooled peptides for 5 h at 37 ° C / 5 % CO 2 in the presence of Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail ( brefeldin A and monensin ; eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA )	1
14997	The cell stimulation cocktail ( plus protein transport inhibitors ; PMA ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) , ionomycin , brefeldin A and monensin ; eBioscience ) was used as a positive control and R10 media as the negative control	1
14998	All the cells were then stained for surface and @GENE$ as described by the manufacturer ' s instructions ( BD Biosciences , San Diego , CA , USA )	1

15020	The Y - maze test was carried out as described previously 80	1
15021	Briefly , the test was performed in a Y - shaped maze with three opaque plastic arms situated at 120 ° angles from each other	1
15022	Each mouse was placed individually in the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore the maze freely during an 8 - min session	1
15023	The series of arm entries were recorded visually	1
15024	Alternation was defined as successive entries into the three arms , on overlapping triplet sets	1
15025	The percent alternation was calculated as the ratio of actual to possible alternations ( defined as the total number of arm entries minus two ) multiplied by 100	1
15026	Spontaneous alternation ( % ) was used to quantify short - term memory .	1

15053	The GLM approach offers many statistical advantages over other approaches [ 25 ] in efficiently testing spatial hypotheses ( see Text S1 for a detailed comparative analysis )	1
15054	Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit ( such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean ) , which can be applied to models with among - location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor , have been shown to perform poorly [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]	1
15055	Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here	1
15056	Importantly , the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and , unlike the GLM model , cannot identify which of the top - ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables	1
15057	A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor , it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients ( b ) .	1

15073	Although perturbations of normal microbiota , such as occur with @DISEASE$ , raise the pH , the secretions generally remain in the acidic range [ 26 , 27 ]	1
15074	Semen rapidly neutralizes cervicovaginal secretions , but the extent of the pH change is variable	1
15075	For example , a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range , whereas a small amount may not [ 28 , 29 ]	1
15076	The pH of rectal secretions ranges from about 6	1
15077	8 to 7	1
15078	2 [ 30 ] .	1
15079	As a whole , our data imply that regulatory polymorphisms which alter expression levels of @GENE$ of this gene network ( such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) might predispose to @DISEASE$	1
15080	This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of Ttn , one @GENE$ ur candidate upstream r@GENE$ ased in @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$ ( Deshmukh et al	1
15081	2015 ) and a recent GWAS that has for the first time identified the TTN locus as a susceptibility@GENE$  @DISEASE$ in humans ( Christophersen et al	1

15087	Finally , it is difficult to assess CTL activity in reservoir hosts	1
15088	Most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic	1
15089	This limits use of traditional CTL assays that require MHC class I - matched target cells	1
15090	The generation of highly inbred strains is challenging and may result in alleles that do not represent the natural biology of @DISEASE$ , thus it may not be desirable to generate highly inbred rodents	1
15091	It is possible to establish MHC homozyg@GENE$ lled breeding and screening of littermates for the same haplotypes	1
15092	Even then , the generation of susceptible cell lines can be problematic	1
15093	While endothelial cell lines can be generated with retroviral transformation , it is possible the cells may have activated antiviral pathways that could alter in vitro CTL responses	1
15094	The use of growth fact@GENE$ ng endothelial cells in culture may be more attractive	1
15095	Until methods are established for generating syngeneic , susceptible target cells , assessment of CTL responses in reservoir hosts will be difficult .	1
15096	Another ( Nurse 4 ) added : " There is a poor supply of N95 masks ( sad ) and it puts us in danger of contracting infection	1
15097	But we are surviving by the grace of God	1
15098	We are told that the hospital doesn ' t have enough money to buy masks	1

15100	Nurse ( N1 ) indicated that : " It is sad the way @DISEASE$ is spreading in our communities , we have a record of patients who come from one family or who are related	1
15101	They decide to infect others or share their sputum just for them to get a @DISEASE$ grant	1
15102	When they realize that they are recovering , they default for the social grant to continue	1
15103	Most of those patients , when they come back to the hospitals , they will be MDR or XDR ; they do not survive	1
15104	Some @DISEASE$ patients infect one another in the @DISEASE$ ward	1
15105	" Nurse ( N6 ) had this to say : " Patients also spread disease when they use public transport	1
15106	They go to church and when they are in shopping complex	1

15110	A network focusing on @GENE$ regulation and a pathway involving @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) degradation were enriched according to the Metacore TM database	1

15122	The Gene Ontology ( GO ) project aims to unify biology by providing a controlled vocabulary of terms for all @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 40 ] , but has long had a focus on eukaryotes with less emphasis on prokaryotes and their viruses	1
15123	On the other hand , the @GENE$ database contains high quality annotations for hundreds of @GENE$ , using subsystems - based controlled vocabulary	1
15124	Mapping @GENE$ functional roles to GO annotations for a given set of @GENE$ or @GENE$ can be achieved via @GENE$ servers	1
15125	A workflow , detailed elsewhere ( Short URL : http : / / bit	1

15127	Of note , our study shows that there are similarities in the chest radiographs series from different EDs that can , for the most part , be modeled by similar time series models	1
15128	Similarities of the time series model across EDs have a number of ramifications for detection of outbreak signatures	1
15129	First , by borrowing information across the different EDs we can build more complicated multivariate time series models , possibly involving the joint modeling of chest radiograph and visit counts across locations	1
15130	Second , we could use these models to jointly detect outbreak signatures across large spatial regions	1
15131	In this context , Diggle et al	1
15132	[ 20 ] use spatio - temporal Cox models to identify anomalies ( real and artificial outbreaks ) in the space - time distribution of @DISEASE$	1
15133	But , some caution is needed because one potential drawback of aggregating data spatially is that the chance of detection can be reduced ( data from unaffected areas will mask the outbreak signature , and increase the detection time ) [ 21 ]	1
15134	For localized outbreaks , there is still some utility in building models that borrow strength across EDs , even if the joint detection of outbreak signatures is not meaningful	1
15135	In terms of these localized outbreaks , a geographically close site could act as a benchmark to judge detections at other sites	1
15136	For example , under certain circumstances an epidemic detection signal triggered in Columbus , but not in Akron , could imply that some unusual event had occurred in Columbus	1
15137	It should be noted , however , that even though there are similarities in the time series models , our simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity and timeliness to detect outbreak signatures using chest radiograph counts were different across EDs	1
15138	These differences may limit the utility of our models in comparing signals across different EDs .	1
15139	The filtered series will be different for each simulated outbreak pattern realization	1
15140	Just as in Figure 4 with the radiograph series , we calculate the 0	1

15145	Relative to the no - outbreak situation , positive values	1
15146	According to phylogenetic differences , @DISEASE$ has been divided into three different subtypes , European , Siberian , and Far Eastern	1
15147	The European subtype is mainly transmitted by Ixodes ricinus , whereas the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes are primarily transmitted by Ixodes persulcatus [ 21 , 22 ]	1
15148	TBEV is found in central , eastern , and northern Europe and Asia ( Figure 1 ) and correlates with the presence of infected ticks	1
15149	Ixodes ricinus is found throughout Europe , whereas Ixodes persulcatus is found in Eastern Europe in the west , and China and Japan in the east [ 23 ] .	1

15157	On entry into the nucleus , the genome of HSV - 1 is also associated rapidly with @GENE$ [ 34 ] and @GENE$ are assembled , though in irregularly or randomly spaced manners , on 1 hour post infection	1
15158	Therefore , it is intriguing and difficult to explain on why and how only the @GENE$ is subjected to the nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity of @GENE$ , leaving @GENE$ largely unaffected	1
15159	Perhaps as the @GENE$ , which was not completely assembled with @GENE$ or was assembled with unstable @GENE$ , can be digested by intrinsic @GENE$ of @GENE$ during HSV - 1 replication takes place ( 6 hours post infection or early stage ) , especially considering that the @GENE$ is found to be relatively free of @GENE$ following viral DNA replication , beyond 6 hours post infection [ 35 ]	1
15160	When we compared the HSV - 1 DNA accumulation between SCH07072 and muSCH cells on immediate early stage , early stage and late stage respectively , muSCH cells showed limited antiviral activities at immediate early stage but did not show any antiviral activity later on	1
15161	Thus it may indicates that mutant 3D8 scFv with only intrinsic @GENE$ activity is not sufficient for providing a full protection for host cells against @DISEASE$ 1 infection once HSV - 1 DNA replication successfully takes places in nucleus in muSCH cells	1
15162	Therefore , it may be possible that the antiviral effects@GENE$ cFv against @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ infection were contributed @GENE$ h the DNase activity , which is mainly effective in the nucl@GENE$ d the RNase activity mainly effective in the cytoplasm	1
15163	This proposed antiviral activity can be explained by ( 1 ) temporal blockage of viral DNA replication in the nucleus and protein translation in the cytosol and ( 2 ) spatial protection ( nucleus vs	1

15185	Patients and specimens	1
15186	Serum samples from healthy individuals and patients with @DISEASE$ and HBV - induced @DISEASE$ were obtained from the Department of @DISEASE$ and the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat - sen University ( Guangzhou , China ) ( Tables I and II )	1
15187	@DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ was diagnosed using the previously described criteria ( 10 , 11 Sample preparation and protein extraction	1

15190	Each sample was precipitated with four - times the volume of cold acetone	1
15191	The total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay .	1
15192	Because the ICIs observed in @DISEASE$ specimens are identif@GENE$ bodies synthesized from pathologic @DISEASE$ specimens , the authors of these studies conclude that these inclusions are of viral origin , and specifically related to the etiological agent of @DISEASE$ [ 51 , 105 ]	1
15193	However , it is possible that these ICIs could be any number of host - derived functional structures that are typically observed as protein aggregates	1
15194	Aggresomes , one such structure , are invo@GENE$ f misfolded proteins during cellular stress [ 111 ]	1
15195	Aggresomes are frequently observed as large intrace@GENE$ tes of host proteins and are frequently surroun@GENE$ te filament proteins	1

15198	Unfortunately , none of these markers were tested	1
15199	In addition , there are several other large intracellular protein aggregates such as stress granules , p - bodies , prion - aggregates , aggresome - like induced structures ( ALIS ) and autophagosomes [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ]	1
15200	It is pos@GENE$ ified by antibodies A and J are one of these structures ; perhaps the manifestation of @DISEASE$ is the improper regulation of one of these processes .	1

15207	With 100 cases , we also expected to fit reliable multivariate models with up to 10 covariates without over fitting the data [ 11 ] .	1
15208	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a highly contagious and often fatal disease characterised by acute severe @DISEASE$ , severe @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
15209	@DISEASE$ is usually associated with infection by feline parvovirus ( FPV ) , a member of the genus Protoparvovirus ( formerly @DISEASE$ )	1
15210	Protoparovirus is one of eight genera of vertebrate viruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae of the family Parvoviridae	1
15211	Collectively , @DISEASE$ and canine parvovirus ( CPV ) , along with associated variants found in various carnivore species such as mink and raccoons , constitute the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [ 2 ] .	1
15212	It is possible that there is not one cause of @DISEASE$ , but multiple etiologies that result in similar pathogenesis	1
15213	This may explain the clinical variability and lack of a definitive agent , however , the low recurrence rate even in high prevalence areas speaks against a large number of causes [ 40 ]	1
15214	A superantigen response was considered by numerous groups [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ]	1
15215	Certain @DISEASE$ contain proteins that non - specifically bind effe@GENE$ ing a more generalized polyclonal expansion and inflammation , termed a superantigen effect	1
15216	Polyclonality of T ce@GENE$ e has been shown in @DISEASE$ [ 47 , 48 ] ; however , the reports are variable as to which subset @GENE$ rs are expanded [ 49 ]	1
15217	Other studies support a traditional oligoclonal response consistent with an immune response against a specific etiologic agent	1
15218	Oligoclonal expansion of CD8 + T cells [ 50 ] and peripheral IgM + B cell responses have been demonstrated [ 5 , 51 ] , and IGG + clonality is seen in studies from our own laboratory ( unpublished )	1
15219	Numerous other studies have not shown superantigen - associated expansions of cell subsets [ 50 , 52 , 53 ]	1
15220	This concept is reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 45 ] .	1
15221	In this work , the influence of human movement on airborne disease transmission in an airplane cabin is investigated	1
15222	An on - flight outbreak case of @DISEASE$ is chosen to demonstrate the risk assessment process	1
15223	The Eulerian - Lagrangian approach is used to simulate the dispersion and deposition of infectious droplets expelled by the index patient	1
15224	The simulation result shows that human movement improves the mixing of the air in the airplane cabin , strengthens the downward transport of the aerosols , and decreases the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols .	1
15225	Dear Sotiris Please find my detailed comments on the attachment and my review below :	1
15226	All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times	1
15227	All data from western blot analysis , real - time PCR , and @GENE$ assays were expressed as mean ± SD	1
15228	In cell viability assay , the bar graphs represented the mean ± s	1

15230	of relative cell viability compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments	1
15231	In western blot analysis , the optical densities ( OD ) of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were normalized to the OD of @GENE$ in the same membrane	1
15232	The data represented the mean ± s	1
15233	d	1
15234	of relative OD compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments with three samples in each	1
15235	In transient transfection assay , the bar graphs represent the mean ± s	1
15236	d	1
15237	of relative @GENE$ activities compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments	1
15238	One - way anova analyses followed by the Least Significant Difference ( LSD ) test were performed	1
15239	Asterisks showed in the figures indicate significant differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding control condition	1
15240	P - values < 0	1
15241	05 were considered statistically significant .	1
15242	Although @GENE$ was upregulated in a few samples , neither of the @DISEASE$ strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points , suggesting an impact of @DISEASE$ infec@GENE$  on the IFN pathway response ( Fig	1
15243	4C )	1
15244	It has been des@GENE$  su@GENE$ si@GENE$ g 1 ( SOCS1 ) , a negative r@GENE$ ator of IFN responses , is upregulated in cells infected by JEV ( 36 )	1
15245	Interestingly , 48 to 72 hpi both @DISEASE$ strains induced a significan@GENE$ gulation of SOCS1 in NEC , with higher gene expression in Laos - infected cells ( Fig	1
15246	4D ) .	1
15247	Approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb @GENE$ me was amplified using degenerate primers ( Table S1 )	1
15248	Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible , while still being specific enough to not cross - react with non - targets	1
15249	Sensitivity was achieved by targeting regions of high sequence similarity , identified through a Multiple Sequence Alignment ( MSA ) of the target sequences	1
15250	Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms , determined by searching a database of known genome sequences	1
15251	Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches	1
15252	This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et	1
15253	al	1
15254	[ 16 ] , which accommodates degenerate primer design for diverse target genomes , and places a lower relative priority on primer uniqueness as compared to other known genomes	1
15255	For @DISEASE$ virus , which lacks perfect primer - length conservation aroun@GENE$ gions of interest , it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for@GENE$ gions	1
15256	From the ident@GENE$ gions , which included@GENE$ gion@GENE$ gions , individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced	1
15257	Final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems such as primer dimerization .	1
15258	Most of the recent studies conducted in pigs have used CS in experimental conditions for the control of @DISEASE$ in the post - weaning period ( Table 1 )	1
15259	Several of these studies were performed to examine the effectiveness of alternative substances to colistin in the treatment of @DISEASE$ [ 77 , 78 ] .	1
15260	In the literature , many alternatives to antimicrobial usage in food - producing animals have been reported and discussed [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ]	1
15261	The most promising way to mitigate the development of colistin resistance is to reduce the use of antimicrobials at the farm level ( Table 2 )	1
15262	There are documented relationships between housing conditions and incidence of @DISEASE$ in pig herds ; Madec et al	1
15263	[ 30 ] claimed that prevention of @DISEASE$ could be based solely on the control of zootechnical conditions	1
15264	Moreover , stocking density reduction could be considered as a paramount strategy to decrease occurrence of @DISEASE$ as well as other diseases in pigs [ 91 ]	1
15265	Thus , improvement of breeding conditions in pig farms is a crucial measure to reduce the susceptibility of animals to @DISEASE$ and consequently to reduce the use of antimicrobials in pig production [ 28 ]	1
15266	The management strategies around weaning should focus on measures that avoid any kind of stress for pigs	1
15267	These measures include preventing the spread of infection , providing the pigs with good thermal comfort , giving them adapted feed and allowing access to this feed for all pigs	1
15268	Considerable research has been performed into developing diets for weaners and there is now a range of high quality diets that are readily digested by the early - weaned pig [ 31 ]	1
15269	The main purposes of these diets are to achieve A powerful ora@GENE$  proposed immunization procedure required large quantities of F4 [ 8 ] Leads to a specific mucosal immune response Antigen degraded by the pH of the stomach and by dig@GENE$ 	1
15270	This review found that @DISEASE$ outbreaks disproportionately affect the poor , specifically communities with poor physical infrastructure and limited access to quality public health services	1
15271	The link between income and politics of epidemics has been discussed in the social science literature , where poverty is perceived to be the greatest risk factor	1
15272	For example , Farmer ( 1996 ) argued that disease outbreaks , e	1
15273	g	1
15274	, Ebola systematically affecting poor people and are tied to regional trade networks ( Alsan et al	1
15275	2011 )	1
15276	Building on this literature , Marcella ( 2011 ) uses the term structural violence to highlight the institutional biases , inequalities , and economic policies that emanate from global centers of power and privilege , which tend to marginalize poor people during outbreaks	1
15277	These linkages highlight social and economic inequalities ( within communities , societies and countries ) , which are complex and often ignored by the medical ( and political ) communities ( Alsan et al	1
15278	2011 ; Leach et al	1
15279	2010 )	1
15280	Indeed , some of the narratives criticized the ( epidemiological ) evidence , which tends to overlook the role of poverty in the facilitation of disease spread	1
15281	For instance , focusing on pregnancy in the case of @DISEASE$ in Brazil was criticized for overlooking the conditions of poverty that might also / instead be responsible for the spike in cases of @DISEASE$ ( Diniz 2016 )	1
15282	Furthermore , responding to @DISEASE$ in Liberia with developmental aid that is not designed for contexts with insufficient infrastructure was criticized again for overlooking the role of poverty ( Nunes 2016 )	1
15283	This limited focus on the role of poverty in the peer - reviewed medical literature calls into question the politics of the research process itself	1
15284	For example , what institutions are funding the research and what are the interests of the stakeholders in the research process ? Who gets funding to conduct the research ? What are the advantages of overlooking poverty for those producing the evidence ? By disregarding the role of poverty and income inequality , epidemic responses will remain insufficient , and may , instead worsen the situation of poor populations ( Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005 )	1
15285	Perhaps poverty remains unaddressed in epidemic responses as its origins in a neoliberalist society feel too deep to uproot .	1
15286	Several published reviews and books have highlighted the role of bats as reservoirs for emerging viruses , and described factors that may make bats " special " as disease reservoirs [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]	1
15287	Bat - associated viruses have contributed to thousands of human deaths and economic losses exceeding billions of dollars [ 18 , 26 ] , notably @DISEASE$ , severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , and @DISEASE$ 	1
15288	In Section ' Comparison with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ' we provide more insight on the differences and merits of Iterative @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
15289	Then in Section ' Comparison with ShapeKnots ' we compare accuracy of Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots , a method that incorporates SHAPE reactivity data to predict RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure	1
15290	In Section ' Iterative HFold with SimFold ' s suboptimal structures ' we compare performance accuracy of Iterative @GENE$ with two inputs : @GENE$ and suboptimal structures	1
15291	Section ' Energy model ' provides more insight into the energy model used in this work .	1
15292	Far - UVC dosimetry	1
15293	Optical power measurements were performed using an 818 - UV / DB low - power UV enhanced silicon photodetector with an 843 - R optical power meter ( Newport , Irvine , CA )	1
15294	Additional dosimetry to determine the uniformity of the UV exposure was performed using far - UVC sensitive film as described in our previous work 28 , 29	1
15295	This film has a high spatial resolution with the ability to resolve features to at least 25 µm , and exhibits a nearly ideal cosine response 30 , 31	1
15296	Measurements were taken between experiments therefore allowing placement of sensors inside the chamber .	1
15297	Flaviviruses are globally distributed pathogens causing millions of human infections every year	1
15298	@DISEASE$ are @DISEASE$ and are mainly transmitted by either ticks or mosquitoes	1
15299	Mosquito - borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the innate immune response have been well - studied and reviewed extensively , thus this review will discuss tick - borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the host innate immune response .	1
15300	In a typical management setting , such as the @DISEASE$ outbreak of 2003 , public health professionals are confronted with a novel ( or perhaps a highly virulent variant of an existing ) pathogen that is spreading rapidly through a predominantly susceptible population	1
15301	One of the important tasks of any modeling exercise is to provide insights into some of the epidemiological characteristics of the invading infection , such as its transmissibility , virulence , and persistence dynamics	1
15302	Of great interest is the estimation of the basic reproductive ratio of the infection ( R 0 ) , which measures the transmission potential of the infection , and determines the degree of control required .	1
15303	Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer ' s protocol	1
15304	Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers using the First Strand Synthesis kit ( Invitrogen )	1
15305	Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using gene - specific primers	1
15306	As an internal control , real - time RT - qPCR was also performed using the @GENE$ , @GENE$	1
15307	The control was set arbitrarily at 1 and fold - increase over control was calculated by the ΔΔCt method	1
15308	The experiments were conducted at least three times , each in triplicates	1
15309	The results were plotted in graph format as mean ± SD .	1
15310	Saleh et al	1
15311	( 2010 ) [ 65 ] have conducted a comparative evaluation of the antioxidant properties of 248 essential oils by the spectrophotometer method of DPPH along with DPPH / TLC	1
15312	Only 17 species possessed effective antioxidant activity , mainly belonging to the Lamiaceae family	1
15313	The active compounds detected by DPPH / TLC method included phenols , non - phenols , oxygenated or non - oxygenated compounds .	1
15314	Here	1
15315	The most commonly used DPPH assay is simple and highly sensitive	1
15316	DPPH is commercialised in the radical form due to its stability	1
15317	This radical shows a strong absorption maximum at 517 nm ( purple )	1
15318	In the presence of antioxidants , the colour turns from purple to yellow	1
15319	Therefore the sole equipment needed for the assay is a UV - Vis spectrophotometer .	1
15320	In addition , we measured serum ALT levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice from all four treatment groups 28 days after rVV - HCV immunization	1
15321	Serum ALT levels were not significant - ( + / 2 ) and the Cremediated activation of the @GENE$	1
15322	@GENE$ was cloned downstream of the @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ flanked by two @GENE$	1
15323	This cDNA contains the core , @GENE$	1
15324	( B ) Cre - mediated genomic DNA recombination	1
15325	After poly ( I : C ) injection , @GENE$ was extracted from liver tissues and analyzed by quantitative RTD - PCR for @GENE$ - mediated transgenic recombination	1
15326	The transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after the injection	1
15327	In all cases , n = 3 mice per group	1
15328	( C ) @GENE$ expression was sustained for at least 600 days after poly ( I : C ) injection	1
15329	( D ) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that most hepatocytes expressed the @GENE$ within 6 days after injection	1
15330	( E ) Liver sections from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice after the poly ( I : C ) injection	1
15331	Infiltrating lymphocytes ( arrows ) were observed on days 6 and 180 ; @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) was observed on day 360	1
15332	In contrast , these pathological changes were not observed in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice after the injection	1
15333	The inset image shows abnormal mitosis in a @DISEASE$ cell	1
15334	( F ) Hepatocyte swelling and abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords ( silver staining ) , as well as abnormal glycogen accumulation ( PAS staining ) were observed on day 90 in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice	1
15335	We observed @DISEASE$ ( oil - red - O staining ) on day 180 and , subsequently , @DISEASE$ ( Azan staining ) on day 480	1

15342	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) Mybpc3 @GENE$ 	1
15343	Of the 100 probes , 76 had unique @GENE$ ( Table S3 in File S2 )	1
15344	These genes were considered to be part of a @GENE$	1
15345	This extended gene network contained a number of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) of interest in the context of @DISEASE$	1
15346	We used this pulmonary @GENE$ gate enriched GO terms , signaling pathways , and human phenotypes related to the coexpression of these genes in the lung using WebGestalt	1
15347	The pulmonary @GENE$ icantly enriched with GO terms involving biological processes related to both striated and cardiac muscle function and development ( Table 5 )	1
15348	Enriched molecular functions included cytoskeletal protein binding and cation transmembrane transporter activity ( Table 5 ) , and enriched cellular components included contractil@GENE$ )	1
15349	Collectively , these data support our approach for identifying genes that are likely to be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium , as our coexpresse@GENE$  enriched for cardiac muscle function .	1
15350	Radiolabeling of cells with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix , immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting was done as described earlier [ 8 ]	1
15351	Data obtained is representative of at least 3 independent sets of experiments conducted	1
15352	Results were quantified using the NIH Image V : 1	1
15353	32 program , normalized values calculated and graphs plotted wherever indicated	1
15354	All the inhibitors were added during starvation period and maintained throughout the labeling period .	1
15355	Although we did not detect virus RNA in the blood , in some subjects the spleens , kidneys , brain and the oviducts were RRT - PCR positive on days 4 and 6 pi , even though attempts to isolate the virus and detect it by IHC gave positive results only in the case of the oviducts .	1
15356	Overall , these data support a model , whereby certain @GENE$ play an important role in HIV - 1 replication as they regulate @GENE$ processing and thus the infectivity of released virions and simultaneously the entry of @GENE$ into the UPS and @GENE$ - I pathway .	1
15357	To rule out the possibility that other microbiological agents played a role in the pathogenesis of the disease we carried out bacteriology examination , PCRs for M	1
15358	synoviae and gallisepticumas well as virological analyses on oviductal swabs collected in experiment 2 .	1
15359	The retrospective evaluation of single case reports did not provide clear evidence about the prognosis of FeL because the clinical data available are heterogeneous and sometimes incomplete ; however , some conclusions can be inferred	1
15360	Both treated and untreated cats may live for years before the deterioration of their health status mainly due to @DISEASE$ that might be unrelated to @DISEASE$	1
15361	The exact role of L	1
15362	infantum infection in the development of @DISEASE$ causing @DISEASE$ has to be confirmed	1
15363	However , it can significantly influence life expectancy and any concurrent diseases should be treated if detected	1
15364	In case of @DISEASE$ , the International Renal Interest Society ( IRIS ) staging system is recommended for therapy , follow - up and prognosis ( http : / / www	1
15365	iris - kidney	1
15366	com ) .	1
15367	In conclusion , currently , no scientific evidence concerning the best treatment for @DISEASE$ is available , but more extensive clinical experience is available for treatment with allopurinol ( 10 mg / kg BID or 20 mg / kg SID )	1
15368	The drug of choice to be used in @DISEASE$ should nevertheless be based on the best compliance and safety for the cat with the alternatives of long term oral drug treatment ( allopurinol ) or a parenteral therapy ( meglumine antimoniate )	1
15369	As there are no studies on the safety of these drugs in cats , it is recommended to strictly monitor the health status of animals under treatment by means of regular check - SC : subcutaneous ; IM : intamuscular ; PO : per os a a same cat was treated with the three different therapeutic regimens at subsequent times ups including urinalysis , and advising the owner to promptly report any abnormality .	1
15370	Gene Expression Networks in the Murine Pulmonary Myocardium Provide Insight into the Pathobiology of @DISEASE$ 	1
15371	All work was carried out in a designated PCR - clean area as previously described ( Yu et al	1
15372	)	1
15373	RNA was extracted from infected and uninfected cells using Trizol reagent ( Gibco - BRL , Rockville , Md	1
15374	) and isolated as specified by the manufacturer	1
15375	The RNA was DNAse - treated ( @GENE$ - RNase - Free , Ambion ) to remove any contaminating DNA ; 200 ng of total RNA was reverse - transcribed with oligo dT primers using the High Capacity @GENE$ RT Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) in a 20 µl @GENE$ reaction , as specified by the manufacturer	1
15376	For quantitative PCR , the @GENE$ was added to a 20 µl reaction with @GENE$ ( Applied Biosystems ) and 0	1
15377	2 µM of primer ( Table 1 )	1
15378	The amplification was carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 for 40 cycles under the following conditions : initial denaturation at 95 • C for 10 min ; 40 cycles of 95 • C for 15 s and 60 • C for 1 min	1
15379	The fold changes were calculated relative to @GENE$ using the Ct method .	1
15380	The identification of highly pathogenic MERS - CoV suggests that coronaviruses present an incessant and long - term hazard to humans	1
15381	Development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to contain their infections is an urgent need , and yet currently no antiviral treatments against @DISEASE$ are available	1
15382	MERS - CoV is known to interact with host cell surface receptor D@GENE$ r C@GENE$ ith its s@GENE$  which subsequently leads to its entry in the host cell [ 61 ]	1
15383	Our knowledge regarding the exact mechanisms that follow thereafter is still limited and requires more research	1
15384	Due to lack of definite treatment , supportive therapy remains the only solution	1
15385	Present development consists of the previous experiences of other @DISEASE$ like SARS - CoV , which have been studied in in vitro and in vivo models	1
15386	Tremendous efforts are being made in this direction and various antiviral and related therapies have been identified	1
15387	Use of humanized mo@GENE$ nt plasma and therapeutic peptides has been shown efficacious	1
15388	Repurposing of the currently available drugs is also being tried to extend their efficacy against @DISEASE$	1
15389	Some potential options are discussed in detail below .	1
15390	This procedure was essentially described in [ 31 ]	1
15391	To obtain virions issued from CD45 expressing cells ( @GENE$ is indeed mostly a T cell marker ) , SupT1 stably expressing @GENE$ were challenged with replication - competent NL4 - 3 at an MOI of 3 to induce a rapid burst of infection and robust production of virion particles	1
15392	Virions produced upon ongoing infection were harvested 6 days after infection and were incubated with magnetic beads coupled with an @GENE$ ( Miltenyi ) for 2 hours	1
15393	Beads were then recuperated on a magnetic support following the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
15394	Bound and unbound material was analyzed by WB .	1
15395	We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed for studies published between 1 January 1990 and 9 December 2015	1
15396	We restricted studies to those conducted in the USA to minimize potential geographic variation of associations	1
15397	The following search string was used : ' ( bacteria [ All Fields ] OR e x p l a n a t o r y b o x 1	1
15398	c h a l l e n g e s i n d e t e r m i n i n g t h e e t i o l o g y o f p n e u m o n i a Even in countries where @DISEASE$ surveillance is routinely conducted such as the USA , no information on microbial etiology is recorded for approximately 65 - 85 % of hospitalized @DISEASE$ cases [ 11 , 12 ]	1
15399	Severely ill patients often are not included in surveillance , organisms on the causal pathway may have been cleared by the time that the patient presents clinically or prior to testing because of rapid treatment with antibiotics when @DISEASE$ is suspected , and autopsies are infrequently done on the elderly	1
15400	To optimally determine etiology , direct sampling via bronchoalveolar lavage is required , but usually detection of causal agents is conducted on blood , sputum and urine because of ease of collection , ethical issues and costs	1
15401	@DISEASE$ is observed in only 7 % - 13 % of @DISEASE$ cases and 1 - 5 % in child pneumonia cases , sputum can potentially be contaminated by bacteria in the URT and is difficult to obtain from children , and blood and urine antigen assays require further validation or are limited to adults and specific to only a few pathogens ( e	1
15402	g	1
15403	Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella species ) ( reviewed by Murdoch et al	1
15404	[ 13 ] )	1
15405	Although modern molecular biologic techniques make it feasible to conduct untargeted screens for all bacterial , viral and fungal species present , it is still difficult to distinguish between infection , colonization or contamination [ 14 ]	1
15406	Continued efforts are needed to develop more accurate methods to determine the etiology of @DISEASE$ , and thus maximize treatment and prevention efforts .	1
15407	Nurse ( N1 ) said : " the hospital infrastructure is very old and deteriorating , the wards ' layout is not conducive for @DISEASE$ wards , it has small windows that fuel bacterial concentration	1
15408	"	1
15409	The findings of this study revealed that there was a more negative practice environment in the @DISEASE$ wards than a positive one	1
15410	According to the study that was done by Washeya [ 15 ] , it is important that the working environment enhances productivity	1
15411	The findings of this study indicated that there was a poor practice environment in the @DISEASE$ wards	1
15412	There was also an inadequate supply of personal protective materials	1
15413	This leads to negative practice by the nurses , since they are afraid to contract diseases	1
15414	The findings of the present study concur with those of a study that was done by Mametja [ 16 ] , which indicated that there was a more negative practice environment in @DISEASE$ wards which affected the quality of nursing care in the public hospital .	1
15415	The diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in the patient was confirmed by both @DISEASE$ virus isolation from the throat swab and also detection@GENE$ od@GENE$ ( IgM ) in the serum	1
15416	Having been exposed to an unvaccinated relative who had laboratory - confirmed @DISEASE$ , the patient , a 7 - month old infant , then developed the classical manifestations and progressed through the typical natural history of @DISEASE$ , without developing any other complications	1
15417	@DISEASE$ is caused by @DISEASE$ , a @DISEASE$ in the family @DISEASE$ [ 9 ]	1
15418	The disease remains an important childhood affliction , causing 89 780 deaths globally in 2016 , despite the availability of an effective vaccine [ 10 ]	1
15419	In Malaysia , @DISEASE$ vaccination is given to infants aged 9months	1
15420	With a vaccination coverage of 94 % in 2016 , the incidence of @DISEASE$ in Malaysia was reported to be 5	1
15421	0 per 100 , 000 population while the mortality rate from @DISEASE$ was 0	1
15422	02 per 100 , 000 population [ 11 ]	1
15423	Although the diagnosis is usually made based on the characteristic clinical manifestations , confirmation of @DISEASE$ may be obtained by detection of @DISEASE$ specific IgM a@GENE$ o through @DISEASE$ virus identification from throat - swab and urine specimens [ 12 ] .	1
15424	Viruses 2019 , 11 , x 6 of 10 HSV - specific CD8 + T cells capable of producing @GENE$	1
15425	This contributes to reactivation of the virus [ 51 ]	1
15426	Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus - 68 ( MHV - 68 ) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [ 52 , 53 ]	1
15427	Stressors , such as @GENE$ responses and @DISEASE$ , can induce the expression o@GENE$ s that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ]	1
15428	Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [ 55 ]	1
15429	Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [ 56 ]	1
15430	Gerow et al	1
15431	[ 57 ] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation , leading to detection of the virus in blood	1
15432	This reactivation was also associated with a low level o@GENE$ s against the virus	1
15433	Following hibernation the antibody levels increase , which subsequently drives the virus into latency .	1
15434	Given a set of functional roles , one often wishes to understand which subsystems can be inferred from the set	1
15435	The following example script reads as input a set of functional roles and constructs a table of @GENE$ that can be identified , along with their variation codes	1
15436	The data displayed in this simple example could form the start of a research project to gather the functional roles not connected to @GENE$ to determine whether they were not connected because a small set of functional roles were not present in the input , and to seek candidates for such " missing functional roles	1
15437	" The ability to easily map functional roles into @GENE$ will improve as the @GENE$ annotation effort improves its collection of encoded @GENE$ [ 32 ]	1

15444	The simple growth simulation returns the maximum predicted growth rate of the model given the input parameters , the predicted flux through the model reactions during maximum growth , and the predicted uptake and production of nutrients from and to the environment during maximum growth .	1
15445	A total of 265 unique transcripts were identified as differentially accumulated ( > 2 - fold ) between control and @DISEASE$ - infected cells , with 130 transcripts up - regulated and 135 transcripts down - regulated after infection ( S2 Table )	1
15446	Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( Ingenuity Systems , www	1
15447	ingenuity	1
15448	com ) performed on all differentially regulated genes indicated that various pathways and cellular processes were involved during infection , including the immune signalling , the cell - cycle / apoptosis and proteasomal pathw@GENE$ genes and the cell transport machin@GENE$ ig 1A )	1
15449	Transcripts , which could not be functionally annotated were grouped as other or unknown	1
15450	Genes in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway comprised 12 % of differentially regulated transcripts and were selected for further analysis	1
15451	To validate the RNA - Seq analysis , the relative abundance of seven differentially up - regulated transcripts in the ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway was determined by real - time RT - qPCR using target - specific primers	1
15452	The results confirmed that all of the transcripts were up - regulated during infection but the fold - increase was consistently overestimated by RNA - Seq analysis ( Fig 1B ) .	1
15453	We fit the chest radiograph model given by ( 1 ) to the first ten months of data for each ED in city k	1
15454	After specifying a model for { R k , t } , we have a regression model with time series errors , that can be fit using standard maximum likelihood methods	1
15455	We selected the order of the SARIMA model for the time series errors , { X k , t } , as defined by ( 4 ) in the Appendix using standard identification techniques based on the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation ( e	1
15456	g	1
15457	, [ 18 ] )	1
15458	To facilitate the comparison of the time series models across cities , we restricted to same order of model for each series	1
15459	The orders p k = 1 and q k = 1 , correspond to a single autoregressive and @GENE$ term on the daily scale , equivalent to observing an autoregressive process of first order with measurement error ( [ 19 ] , Exercise 2	1
15460	9 )	1
15461	With a seasonal period of seven days ( s = 7 ) , we set P k = 1 and Q k = 1 , so that the random seasonal component is a combination of an autoregressive and @GENE$ , each of first order over a period of seven days	1
15462	The seasonal component of the time series model corresponds to an evolution of a first order autoregressive process with a measurement error over the weeks .	1
15463	A common parametric approach that we follow in this study is to first obtain the residual process by subtracting off the non - stationary part of the model ( i	1
15464	e	1
15465	, the effect of the covariates )	1
15466	We then define the filter { c k , j } , that first decorrelates ( whitens ) this residual process using the onestep - ahead prediction errors and second filters this whitened series using { a l } to yield the detection process { D k , t } .	1
15467	For expression of the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ was subcloned into the @GENE$ ( catalog no	1
15468	28 - 9546 - 48 ; GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) , creating @GENE$	1
15469	The @GENE$ or @GENE$ expressed in E	1

15472	We declare that there is evidence of an outbreak signature in the radiograph data at time t if the outbreak process D k , t , defined by ( 2 ) , exceeds a given threshold , τ k , α	1
15473	Suppose that { Y k , t } is the process defined as the sum of { O k , t } , the extra radiograph counts attributable to the outbreak , and the radiograph process { R k , t } that follows model ( 1 )	1
15474	Removing the non - stationary part due to the estimated effect of the covariates yields By applying the filter to this series we obtain the detection process that we would observe in the presence of extra counts attributable to an outbreak :	1
15475	Several viral proteins have been observed to associate with @GENE$	1
15476	The @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [ 28 ]	1
15477	eEF1A also interacts w@GENE$ e nucleoc@GENE$ protein of @DISEASE$ ( T@GENE$ he virus replication [ 29 ]	1

15479	Previous studies on @DISEASE$ ( TuMV ) , @DISEASE$ ( TMV ) and @DISEASE$ have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex , and thus act@GENE$  chaperone and supports viral@GENE$  [ 32 ] [ 33 ]	1
15480	As m@GENE$ Flaviviridae , both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [ 24 , 34 ]	1
15481	Thereinto , the @GENE$  role of@GENE$ A on the @DISE@GENE$ eplication remains unclear [ 24 ]	1
15482	The HCV @GENE$ nhibits the viral IRES - mediated translation , and t@GENE$ ation inhibitory ef@GENE$ of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A@GENE$ he in vitro translation system [ 34 ]	1
15483	However , we @GENE$  here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth	1
15484	We conclude that t@GENE$ ferent roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct i@GENE$ tions between eEF1A and different viruses	1

15490	Genomic copies of CSFV were quantified by a real - time RT - PCR assay as described previously [ 25 ]	1
15491	The experiment was carried out in triplicates .	1
15492	To determine whether activation of the host immune response caused the reduction with @GENE$ protein levels in the livers of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , we used a highly attenuated VV strain , LC16m8 , to generate three rVVs [ 12 ]	1
15493	Each rVV encoded a different @GENE$ ; rVV - CN2 encoded mainly @GENE$ , @GENE$ encoded @GENE$ , and @GENE$ encoded the entire @GENE$ egion ( Figure 2A )	1
15494	Because rVVs can express a variety of proteins and induce strong and long - term immunity , they have been evaluated as potential prophylactic vaccines [ 13 ] .	1
15495	The origin of human H1N1 influenza is unknown , but it is generally reasoned that it invaded the human population from a natural reservoir [ 5 , 51 ] , most likely an aquatic waterfowl , with pigs as a possible intermediate host	1
15496	In light of the strong tendency toward natural genetic attenuation which we document here , we suggest that the natural reservoir most likely involves a very quiescent viral state , as might occur within a host where there is very little viral replication , and hence much lower mutation rates	1
15497	It would be very interesting to know the rate of @DISEASE$ mutation accumulation in waterfowl .	1
15498	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a major cause of illness and death worldwide , especially in Asia and Africa	1
15499	Despite the fact that @DISEASE$ is a curable illness , the tragedy is that @DISEASE$ poses a grave danger to healthcare workers including nurses because of their exposure to @DISEASE$ patients in health facilities	1
15500	According to the World Health Organization [ 1 ] , @DISEASE$ remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen , and the healthcare systems are being overwhelmed by the increasing number of @DISEASE$ cases .	1
15501	None .	1
15502	The HPLC chromatogram of marker compound , lycorine , is shown in Figure 1 ( a )	1
15503	The calibration curve of lycorine obtained with the developed HPLC method was linear over the range of concentration from 0	1
15504	20 to 50 g / mL with a mean slope of 1493 , mean intercept value of 177	1
15505	8 , and correlation coefficient of greater than 0	1
15506	999	1
15507	The within - day and between - day precisions and accuracies for the analysis of lycorine are shown in Table 1	1
15508	The accuracy values , expressed as percentage of true value , were between 95	1
15509	38 % and 104	1
15510	75 % , while the corresponding precision values expressed as correlation of variation ( CV ) were between 0	1
15511	73 % and 8	1
15512	15 % for both within - day and between - day analysis , thus indicating that the present HPLC - UV method was reliable and repeatable .	1
15513	To increase silencing efficiency in these cells , lentiviruses coding control or @GENE$ were provided along with virion - like particles containing the @GENE$ of SIV MAC ( @GENE$ ) , tool that allows an efficient step of reverse transcription and infection of lentiviruses in myeloid cells [ 38 , 39 ]	1
15514	Two days afterwards , cells were challenged as above with @GENE$ are @GENE$ that display heterogeneous cell type dependent expression and appear incorporated in HIV - 1 virions proportionally to their intracellular levels	1
15515	A ) The ectopic expression levels of @GENE$ in HEK293T cells used before were compared to the endogenous expression of @GENE$ in different cells , incubated or not with @GENE$ ( at 1000 U / mL for 24 hours )	1
15516	Given that the antibodies in our hands did not distinguish between IFITM members @GENE$ were used together , so that all three forms are recognized	1
15517	B ) HEK293T and HeLaP4 cells were transfected with @GENE$ coding @GENE$ and twenty - four hours later cells were stimulated with 1000U / mL of @GENE$ for further two days	1
15518	Virions were then purified and analyzed by WB and upon exo - RT normalization they were used to challenge HeLa P4 cells	1
15519	C ) Primary macrophages obtained upon differentiation of monocytes in @GENE$ for 4 days were challenged with an MOI of 0 , 1 of the R5 - tropic HIV - 1 strain ADA	1
15520	Aliquots of the supernatant were harvested every few days and the extent of viral spread through the culture was measured by exo - RT activity	1
15521	Cells and virion particles were harvested at the indicated time points after infection	1
15522	Virion particles obtained from day 6 and 9 were normalized by exo - RT activity , while the amount of virus obtained at day 3 was too low to be quantified further	1
15523	Exo - RT normalized virions obtained at day 6 and 9 were used to challenge HeLaP5 cells for a MAGI assay	1
15524	The graph presents a typical replication curve obtained upon infection of ADA in primary MDM and the dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay	1
15525	All WB panels present representative results obtained out of 3 to 5 independent experiments and donors , while the graphs present averages and SEM of 3 independent experiments	1
15526	competent ADA at an MOI of 1 prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment	1
15527	Viral particles produced by knockdown cells were then harvested 4 to 6 days after and upon exo - RT normalization , viruses were used on HeLaP5 cells ( expressing the CCR5 co - receptor ) for a MAGI assay ( Figure 5B )	1
15528	Under these conditions , viruses produced in MDM silenced for IFITMs displayed a remarkable increase in their infectivity over a single round infection assay , confirming the positive effect that the removal of IFITMs plays on the infectivity of viral particles	1
15529	Of note , the basal expression of IFITMs was higher in miR30 - shRNA transduced MDM , irrespectively of the target sequence , when compared to untreated cells ( for example , compare the basal levels of expression observed here with the one of Figure 4A )	1
15530	We believe this is due to the detection of the HIV vectors used for silencing , or to the detection of its end products , ie double stranded RNAs , as described in [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ]	1
15531	However , since equal conditions were used for control and specific knockdowns , we believe this not to be a confounding factor in the analysis of the results .	1
15532	Prism 6 ( GraphPad ) was used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis	1
15533	For all analyses , two - tailed Student ' s t - test was used to compare groups , unless otherwise noted , with a = 0	1
15534	05	1
15535	For tests of sample proportions , p values were derived from calculated Z scores with two tails and a = 0	1

15537	Half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) values were calculated using Prism 6 using the built - in analysis tool .	1
15538	incorporated into HIV - 1 virion particles and to decrease the particle infectivity	1
15539	So far , @GENE$ have been essentially studied in the context of target cells , where their overexpression induces a strong antiviral phenotype by trapping incoming viral particles in endosomes	1
15540	This antiviral activity is broad and targets , albeit with different efficiency , a large panel of viruses including HIV - 1 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]	1
15541	Here , we report that the presence of @GENE$ in virus producing cells leads to the production of virions of decreased infectivity	1
15542	In light of the largely membrane distribution of the different @GENE$ their incorporation into retroviral particles is not surprising	1
15543	The diverse spectrum of envelopes and of retroviruses on which @GENE$ exert similar effects leads us the hypothesize that this mechanism of inhibition does not target a specific viral domain , but rather takes advantage of the manner in which HIV and more generally retroviruses assemble	1
15544	In this respect , the membrane distribution of @GENE$ strongly suggests that passive incorporation is the most plausible explanation for their packaging in retroviral particles	1
15545	This incorporation does not seem to occur to the detriment of the one of @GENE$ , as @GENE$ do not modify the @GENE$ to Gag ratio of virion particles ( data not shown ) .	1
15546	The @GENE$ enome contains two open reading frames ; by alternative splicing , one produce@GENE$ mRNAs encodin@GENE$ te@GENE$ ( NS@GENE$ d NS2 ) , and the other transcribe@GENE$ mRNAs encodin@GENE$ te@GENE$ ( VP@GENE$ d VP2 ) 3	1
15547	The VP@GENE$ teins contain the most important antigenic epitopes , which are target@GENE$ od@GENE$	1
15548	VP2 , which represents 90 % o@GENE$ apsid , also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinit@GENE$	1
15549	NS@GENE$ otein , is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of @DISEASE$ - infected cells	1
15550	For@GENE$ tance , NS1 of CPV - 2 has been shown to induce caspase - dependent and p53 - independent apoptosis 5 .	1

15552	5 Having demonstrated the anti - retroviral effect of the DIs PR - 619 and P22077 for the T cell culture adapted molecular HIV - 1 clone NL4 - 3 , we examined whether those DIs also affect HIV - 1 field isolates , like the multidrug resistant field isolate HIV - 1 4lig7	1
15553	This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the @GENE$ and the @GENE$ , causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) and most PR inhibitors [ 63 ] ( Figure 6E )	1
15554	To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV - 1 4lig7 , HLAC were infected with HIV - 1 4lig7 virus preparations standardized for @GENE$ , and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR - 619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A - D )	1
15555	Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose - dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV - 1 field isolate , as it was observed for HIV - 1 NL4 - 3	1
15556	Having demonstrated the anti - retroviral effect of the DIs @GENE$ - 619 and P22077 for the T cell culture adapted molecular HIV - 1 clone NL4 - 3 , we examined whether those DIs also affect HIV - 1 field isolates , like the multidrug resistant field isolate HIV - 14lig7	1
15557	This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the @GENE$ , causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) and most PR inhibitors [ 63 ] ( Figure 6E )	1
15558	To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV - 14lig7 , HLAC were infected with HIV - 14lig7 virus preparations standardized for @GENE$ , and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of @GENE$ - 619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A - D )	1
15559	Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose - dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV - 1 field isolate , as it was observed for HIV - 1NL4 - 3	1
15560	Previously , it was demonstrated that pro inhibitors interfere with HIV - 1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [ 38 ]	1
15561	Moreover , it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV - 1 in cell culture [ 64 ]	1
15562	Both inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors and DIs , induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins , albeit by different mode of action	1
15563	Thus , it was intriguing to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors in combination with DIs would generate synergistic effects on HIV - 1 replication capacity	1
15564	Therefore , HLAC were infected with HIV - 1NL4 - 3 and replication studies were performed as described above ( see Figure 4 )	1
15565	Following permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 together with 0	1
15566	6 nM of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib , specific for the constitutive proteasome [ 65 ] , significant reduction in replication capacity was observed ( Figure 7A , C )	1
15567	Similar results were obtained after permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 and 10 nM PR - 957 , which is a specific inhibitor of the immunoproteasome [ 66 ] ( Figure 7E , G )	1
15568	In contrast , individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range	1
15569	Cell viability was assessed by WST - 1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B , D , F , H )	1
15570	Together , these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS , proteasomes and DUBs	1
15571	Previously , it was demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV - 1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [ 38 ]	1
15572	Moreover , it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV - 1 in cell culture [ 64 ]	1
15573	Both inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors and DIs , induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins , albeit by different mode of action	1
15574	Thus , it was intriguing to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors in combination with DIs would generate synergistic effects on HIV - 1 replication capacity	1
15575	Therefore , HLAC were infected with HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 and replication studies were performed as described above ( see Figure 4 )	1
15576	Following permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 together with 0	1
15577	6 nM of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib , specific for the constitutive proteasome [ 65 ] , significant reduction in replication capacity was observed ( Figure 7A , C )	1
15578	Similar results were obtained after permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR - 619 or P22077 and 10 nM PR - 957 , which is a specific inhibitor of the immunoproteasome [ 66 ] ( Figure 7E , G )	1
15579	In contrast , individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range	1
15580	Cell viability was assessed by WST - 1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B , D , F , H )	1
15581	Together , these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS , proteasomes and DUBs .	1
15582	during the first 4 - 6 days pi	1
15583	In these birds , we noticed that the ovaries were productive , but in the lumen of the oviducts , there were abortive , defective eggs , mucous and fibrinous clots	1
15584	In particular , according to both virological and histopathological data , the most affected section was the infundibulum , and in 29 % of the birds in the first 4 - 6 days pi , the mucosal epithelium was extensively ulcerated and immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse positivity in the remaining epithelial cells	1
15585	On the other hand , despite the evidence of viral replication in the remaining parts of the oviduct , the degree of inflammation was generally lower in the magnum , and practically absent at the level of the uterus	1
15586	Interestingly , the proportion of animals with an @DISEASE$ infection in the oviduct ( 62 % ) closely translated into a proportional drop in egg production during the first 2 weeks post infection , as the average number of laid eggs per day decreased from approximately 10	1
15587	00 to 4	1
15588	43 eggs / group , suggesting that the acute and subacute @DISEASE$ of the organ , in particular at the level of infundibulum , impaired the oviposition in each of the infected hens .	1
15589	It is commonly accepted that @GENE$ plays an important role in retrovirus budding , but its mode of function , particularly in HIV - 1 late replication steps , has been controversially discussed [ 38 , 69 , 70 ]	1
15590	Although some studies suggest that the monoubiquitination of @GENE$ contributes to efficient virus particle release via the @GENE$ required for transport ( @GENE$ ) [ 31 , 71 , 72 ] more recent studies indicate that ubiquitination of @GENE$ can occur independently of the @GENE$ and might be dispensable to drive viral particle release [ 26 , 32 , 34 , 73 , 74 ]	1
15591	Moreover , it was demonstrated that the mutation of the @GENE$ within @GENE$ causes enhanced ubiquitination of @GENE$ due to its prolonged membrane association [ 25 , 26 ]	1
15592	This process has been ascribed to the interaction of @GENE$ with a complex consisting of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and the E3 ligase @GENE$ at the plasma membrane [ 34 ]	1
15593	In addition , it has been shown very recently that the highly conserved @GENE$ and the glutamic acids within @GENE$ can regulate the association of @GENE$ with membranes and thus its entry into the UPS and @GENE$ pathway [ 32 , 33 ]	1
15594	Mutation of these motifs leads to a prolonged membrane association of @GENE$ and thus an enhanced entry into the UPS	1
15595	These observations led us to speculate that in the wt situation certain @GENE$ interact with @GENE$ or other domains of @GENE$ , remove @GENE$ , and thereby regulate its entry into the UPS	1
15596	In this study , we could show that DIs , especially those inhibiting @GENE$ and @GENE$ , enhance the entry of @GENE$ into the UPS and thus into the @GENE$ pathway , indicating that specific @GENE$ play an important role in the regulation of @GENE$ ubiquitination	1
15597	Moreover , @GENE$ processing was impaired upon DI treatment , resulting in a reduced infectivity and replication capacity of HIV - 1 , which can be boosted by combinatory treatment with proteasome inhibitors .	1
15598	@DISEASE$ results in an @DISEASE$ self - limiting and @DISEASE$ that is prevalent in much of the developing world	1
15599	Although self - limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate ~ 1 - 2 % , a high 10 - 20 % mortality rate is observed during pregnancy [ 6 ]	1
15600	Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host	1
15601	A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF - κB @GENE$  is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of @DISEASE$ patients [ 9 ]	1
15602	Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the abi@GENE$ it NF - κB activity in huma@GENE$ SE$ cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation .	1
15603	RNA isolation and real time quantitative RT - PCR analysis RNA was isolated from Huh7 cells using Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) following manufacturers protocol , followed by reverse transcription and real time quantitative RT - PCR analysis as described [ 25 ] .	1
15604	The immune response has two primary components , innate and adaptive	1
15605	The host initially responds to infection by activating innate mechanisms	1
15606	Genes such as those for sensing and repairing DNA damage and the inflammatory process are under positive selection in black flying foxes and @DISEASE$ ( Myotis davidii ) [ 21 ]	1
15607	For instance , there are mutations in the coding sequence of p53 fun@GENE$ e unique to these bats	1
15608	Interfe@GENE$  primary innate @GENE$ ntrol viral replication	1
15609	Several types of interfe@GENE$ en identified in bats , especially Type I and Type III	1
15610	Type I @GENE$ ced after virus infection in Egyptian fruit bats whereas Type II@GENE$ ced similarly in pteropid bats [ 22 , 23 ]	1
15611	It is interesting to note that interfe@GENE$ k flying foxes have contracted in terms of diversity	1
15612	The number of variants of interfe@GENE$  in these bats is lower compared to those in the gene loci of ten other vertebrate species	1
15613	Despite this decrease in interfe@GENE$ ty , black flying foxes express these variants at higher basal levels than other mammalian species	1
15614	This suggests that the interfe@GENE$ stitutively expressed in these bats [ 18 ]	1
15615	In contrast , a recent study of the genome of Egyptian fruit bats shows expanded diversity of Type I @GENE$ , as well as expansion of various other immune @GENE$ sts novel modes of antiviral defense in bats of various species [ 24 ]	1
15616	Novel modes of antiviral defenses could exist in other species of bats and future studies would help in revealing them .	1
15617	When 100 % of @GENE$ big is provided as input , the overall bootstrap 95 % confidence interval for @GENE$ is ( 96	1
15618	11 % , 97	1
15619	24 % ) compared with ( 93	1
15620	85 % , 96	1
15621	07 % ) for Iterative @GENE$ .	1
15622	Similar to HotKnots , the ShapeKnots method of Hajdin et al	1
15623	[ 47 ] is a heuristic algorithm for prediction of pseudoknotted structures	1
15624	This method incorporates @GENE$ reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method	1
15625	SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences , so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set	1
15626	Therefore , we use data set of Hajdin et al	1
15627	to compare these two methods	1
15628	In their data set Hajdin et al	1
15629	have 18 @GENE$ in their training set and 6 @GENE$ in their test set	1

15632	com / 1471 - 2105 / 15 / 147 energy structure as the final output of our program	1
15633	For @GENE$ , we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al	1
15634	[ 47 ] to compare with Iterative HFold	1
15635	Table 5 shows the results of this comparison	1
15636	In all but one sequence of the test set , Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than @GENE$	1
15637	The exception is the @GENE$ ; Hajdin et al	1
15638	note that the accepted structure of @GENE$ is based on a @GENE$ directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between @GENE$ and Iterative HFold may be biased towards @GENE$	1
15639	In the training set , however , Iterative HFold does not perform as well as @GENE$	1
15640	This might be because parameters of @GENE$ were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy	1
15641	Since both the training and test data sets are small , we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods .	1
15642	The tissue samples used in this study were obtained from the archived collection of California Department of Public Health , @DISEASE$ Laboratory ( CDPH - VRDL )	1
15643	Gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) and striped skunks ( @DISEASE$ ) displaying symptoms of @DISEASE$ were submitted for @DISEASE$ testing in the Humboldt Co	1

15645	Brain tissue samples that were laboratory confirmed to be infected with @DISEASE$ virus were forwarded to CDPH - VRDL for genetic characterization	1
15646	Other earlier skunk and fox tissue samples from Humboldt Co	1
15647	were also available from the CDPH - VRDL archives	1

15650	Approximately 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk @DISEASE$ virus variant were placed in TRIzol LS Reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and sent to LLNL for further analysis	1
15651	RNA was extracted from the tissue sample following the manufacturer ' s protocol .	1
15652	The most commonly used framework for epidemiological systems , is still the susceptible - infectious - recovered ( SIR ) class of models , in which the host population is categorized according to infection status as either susceptible , infectious , or recovered [ 16 , 17 ]	1
15653	Subsequent refinements of the model have incorporated an additional exposed ( infected but not yet infectious ) class ( susceptible - exposed - infectious - recovered [ SEIR ] models ) ( see Protocol S1 for mathematical equations )	1
15654	One of the fundamental mathematical assumptions in such models is that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is constant , irrespective of the period already spent in that class	1
15655	While mathematically very convenient , this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods , which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]	1
15656	A more sensible formulation would be to specify the probability of leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class , such that initially the chance of leaving the class is small , but the probability increases as the mean infectious / latent period is reached	1
15657	This would give rise to a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious periods , with a stronger central tendency	1
15658	A convenient way to describe such distributions is to write an expression for the infectious class ( neglecting the latent class for this example ) as follows :	1
15659	FOB and BAL - sampling were performed according to European Respiratory Society recommendations , as previously described [ 12 , 13 ]	1
15660	BAL - samples were divided into 2 aliquots , which were immediately sent to the Microbiology lab and the Hematology lab .	1
15661	In addition , comparative immune studies were performed with optimised plasmids encoding the @GENE$ of either a recently identified Brazilian ZIKV strain or of the original MR766 ZIKV strain	1
15662	Induction of cellular immune responses in mice immunised with either plasmid was measured 1 week after the third vaccination through @GENE$ ELISpot analysis after stimulating splenocytes with the ZIKV - prME peptide pools	1
15663	The results illustrate that the T - cell responses induced by the consensus ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non - consensus Figure 2	1

15697	This result fits with the findings of a previous study , which analyzed a @DISEASE$ outbreak case in an airplane cabin by using likelihood analysis [ 18 ]	1
15698	Yin et al	1
15699	[ 18 ] did not simulate human movement but using a ' mixing ratio ' concept to analyze the effect of human movement on the transmission of @DISEASE$	1
15700	It was also found in the @DISEASE$ case that the likelihood reached maximum at mixing ratio close to zero , which indicated that human movement only had insignificant effect on the airborne transmission of @DISEASE$ .	1
15701	To assess how @GENE$ + @GENE$ depletion affects endogenous SR T cells during @DISEASE$ persistence , we chose DEREG mice , which express@GENE$ ptor under the control of@GENE$ oter ( 22 )	1
15702	Incomplete DT - medi@GENE$ ox@GENE$ Treg depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effect@GENE$ ox@GENE$ Treg ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of @DISEASE$ and systemic lethal @DISEASE$ ( 23 , 24 )	1
15703	DT treatment of @DISEASE$ - infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration ( between days 21 and 28 post infection ) , resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN , coincident with elevated pro - infla@GENE$ compared to DT - treated controls	1
15704	More importantly , Foxp3 + Tre@GENE$ ti@GENE$ ecifically increased frequencies of myelin - specific but not virus - specific CD4 + T cells , indicating preferential regulation of peripheral SR T cells by Foxp3 + Tre@GENE$ ur@GENE$ gly however , @DISEASE$ , viral persistence , and @DISEASE$ remained similar consistent with no changes in virus and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells within the CNS	1

15709	While Foxp3 + Tregs specifically control myelinspecific CD4 +@GENE$ n CLN , Tr1 cells limit SR T cells within the CNS .	1

15711	In pigs , @DISEASE$ can be controlled using various preventive strategies without using antimicrobials ( Table 3 )	1
15712	Feed supplements such as zinc oxide , organic acids , pre - probiotics , synbiotics , dehydrated porcine plasma , antimicrobial peptides , specific egg yolk and bacteriophages [ 31 , 89 , [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] have been used in weanling pigs to enhance growth , feed efficiency and to reduce @DISEASE$	1
15713	Here we give an overview of these feed strategies , focusing on the most used practices showing clinical effectiveness in reducing symptoms of @DISEASE$ and ETEC attachment to enterocytes .	1

15722	Among all 10 , 451 @GENE$ sequenced , 243 positions contained more than one consensus nucleotide across the samples , and 4 of these positions showed 3 different consensus nucleotides across the samples	1
15723	These consensus - level variations across the samples occurred in all five genes of the @GENE$ me as well as fo@GENE$ ns ( Fig	1

15727	T@GENE$ in had the highest rate of consensus - level variation across all samples , but t@GENE$ in had the highest rate of consensuslevel variation in the outbreak samples .	1
15728	The findings in this paper should be interpreted with caution	1
15729	First , this systematic review relied upon published peer - reviewed literature	1
15730	This overlooked documents , such as WHO reports , government documents , and books , which might have contained relevant information	1
15731	For example , we are aware of critical texts in the form of books , which may have enriched this manuscript - specifically , Ng ( 2008 ) and Teo , Yeoh , and Ong ( 2008 ) provide insight into how other cities affected by SARs attributed responsibility , talked about attribution of risk and responsibility for the disease ; ( Teo et al	1
15732	2008 ; Ali 2008 ) Teo , Yeoh , and Ong ( 2008 ) point to Singapore ' s attribution of responsibility and credibility of evidence ; ( Keil and Ali 2008 ) , while Keil and Ali ( 2008 ) also note the racialization of the @DISEASE$ epidemic in Toronto , reflecting on the stigmatization of Toronto ' s Chinese and South Asian communities ( King 2008 )	1
15733	However , King ' s ( 2008 ) work positions globalization as both responsible for causing and responding to @DISEASE$ outbreaks ( Ali et al	1
15734	2016 ) , such narratives are thought to create space to better understand how such processes might be repurposed as public health solutions	1
15735	Finally , Ali , Dumbuya , Hynie , Idahosa , Keil , and Perkins ( 2016 ) ground the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Liberia in the context of colonial legacies , specifically emphasizing that global public health responses were political in that the establishment of the public health infrastructure tasked with responding to @DISEASE$ was influenced by social inequality , colonialism , and racism ( )	1
15736	By adopting a social science perspective , Ali et al	1
15737	( 2016 ) unpack the diverse factorssocial , political , environmental , medical , and legal - that facilitated the escalation of the @DISEASE$ ( )	1
15738	However , since the scope of this paper was limited to peer - reviewed journal publications and one outbreak from each income context as an illustration , such information ( from books and from other contexts ) although relevant , was beyond the paper ' s scope .	1
15739	The legitimacy and authority of the producer of evidence determines its credibility	1
15740	Theoretically , the evidence used to guide response pathways during an epidemic should be credible by these measures	1
15741	Most of the literature reviewed alluded to the fact that the evidence used to inform the responses during the @DISEASE$ epidemic in Liberia was inadequate , leading to a critique of global organizations ' responses	1
15742	For example , some analysts argued that the epidemiological studies necessary to identify the source of @DISEASE$ were insufficient , leading to the ongoing emergence of the epidemic ( Davies and Rushton 2016 )	1
15743	Furthermore , the United Nation ' s Security Council was criticized for not using the United Nations Mission in Liberia ( UNMIL ) to its full capacity in responding to the @DISEASE$ epidemic in addition to accusations of an overdue response ( Roemer - Mahler and Rushton 2016 ) .	1
15744	Overlapping peptides spanning the whole MERS - CoV N polypeptide were used to identify @GENE$ - restricted T cell responses in BALB / c mice immunized with MVA - MERS - N	1
15745	We have identified a @GENE$ restricted decamer peptide epitope in the @GENE$ with CD8 + T cell antigenicity	1
15746	The identification of this epitope , and the availability of the MVA - MERS - N candidate vaccine , will help to evaluate MERS - N - specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine - mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of @DISEASE$ .	1
15747	Unexpectedly , the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Sydney , NSW , was not caused by spread of the Victorian strain , but rather by a separate clade ( C ) comprising a relatively distinct virus [ 20 , 21 ]	1
15748	This finding , together with the detection of additional Australian FPVs ( Clades B and D ) , is consistent with multiple independent virus entries into Australia , including the virus from an unvaccinated cat ( clade D ) , which was seemingly derived from an FPV vaccine strain	1
15749	Three recently vaccinated cats , in which the same vaccine virus was detected ( clade D ) , likely did not have @DISEASE$ , including two with @DISEASE$ co - infections initially diagnosed with @DISEASE$ from a positive commercial faecal qPCR assay	1
15750	MLV vaccine virus shed in faeces can be detected in qPCR assays and CPV faecal antigen tests [ 22 , 23 ]	1
15751	Quantifying viral loads can assist in the discrimination of vaccine and field strains	1
15752	However , quantification data were not provided by the commercial laboratory for these two cases	1
15753	CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are 4 - to 5 - fold lower than those of dogs infected with field strains [ 24 ]	1
15754	Similarly , a recent report found several recently vaccinated cats had low FPV viral loads ( < 1	1
15755	38 × 10 2 copies / mg of faeces ) over a 28 - day period of surveillance [ 23 ] .	1
15756	Of the nine cases for which clinical samples were available for PCR and sequencing , all cats had a positive faecal CPV antigen test result ( FASTest Parvo Strip , Megacor Hoerbranz , Austria ) and were euthanised at diagnosis	1
15757	All cats had been vaccinated on admission using an MLV FPV vaccine ( Felocell 3 or Felocell 4 , Zoetis Pty	1

15761	Background : Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system ( CNS ) locally maintained through @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) signaling	1
15762	Microglial depletion via @GENE$ inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of @DISEASE$ , but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of @DISEASE$ by unknown mechanisms	1
15763	We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critica@GENE$  in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS	1
15764	Methods : The impact of CSF1R signaling durin@GENE$ EASE$ was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of @DISEASE$	1

15767	Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric - based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells	1
15768	Results : Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited hig@GENE$ sceptibility to lethal @DISEASE$ and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery	1
15769	CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co - stimulatory signals @GENE$ ipheral and CNS antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) by depleting CNS cellular sources , which limited local reactivation of CNS - infiltrating virus - specific T cells and reduced viral clearance .	1
15770	Recently , we identified the natural geranylated flavonoids diplacone , mimulone , 3 0 - O - methyldiplacone and 4 0 - Omethyldiplacone from the fruit of Paulownia tomentosa ( empress tree ) and showed that they are potent inhibitors of both @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
15771	Here , we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting @GENE$	1

15776	Recent studies have reported increased viral titers in the CNS of mice treated with @GENE$ antagonists [ 36 , 60 , 61 ] ; however , the mechanisms underlying this loss of virologic control and the effects on peripheral immune responses have not been well characterized	1
15777	We sought to determine the role of @GENE$ signaling in viral clearance of both @DISEASE$	1

15829	0001 contrast to CNS titers , the virus is cleared from the spleen and serum by 8 dpi in WNV - infected , control , and PLX5622 - treated mice	1
15830	Notably , we detected expansion of viral tropism with significant viral replication in the kidney of PLX5622 - treated mice at 4 and 6 dpi compared with control - treated animals	1
15831	These data suggest that renal macrophages may be sensitive to CSF1R antagonism , which is consistent with a study utilizing a model of recovery from acute kidney injury in which CSF1R inhibition with GW2580 reportedly decreased both kidney macrophage proliferation and their polarization towards wound - healing phenotypes [ 62 ]	1
15832	In order to better isolate the role of microglia during neurotropic infection , we examined the effect of PLX5622 in an established murine model of CNS infection using an attenuated strain of WNV ( WNV - NS5 - E218A ) , which lacks 2 ′ - O - methyltransferase activity , thus increasing sensitivity to IFIT - mediated suppression and limiting virulence in peripheral organs with intact immunity [ 8 , 45 , 49 ]	1
15833	Mice infected i	1
15834	c	1
15835	with WNV - NS5 - E218A exhibited increased viral titers in the CNS and increased lethality with PLX5622 treatment compared with control treatment	1
15836	These data suggest that loss of CNS immunity increases lethality of WNV infection	1
15837	Clearance of WNV within the CNS requires local reactivation of antiviral CD8 + T cells for efficient T cell - mediated adaptive immune responses [ 55 , 63 ]	1
15838	Under homeostatic conditions , microglia express very low levels of co - stimulatory B7 molecules ( CD80 / CD86 ) ; however , microglia upregulate expression of these molecules in response to inflammatory cytokines [ 54 , 64 ]	1
15839	Our results show PLX5622 treatment decreased expression of these molecules by depleting their cellular sources in the CNS , which include both resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes / macrophages	1
15840	In the periphery , PLX5622 also reduced cellular expression of B7 molecules on splenic , blood , and pLN APCs	1
15841	Under certain conditions , other co - stimulatory molecules are able to compensate for the loss of B7 signals in T cell reactivation	1
15842	For example , expansion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus - specific antiviral T cells can be driven by either alternative co - stimulatory TNFR superfamily members or by enhanced expression of antiviral cytokines , such as high levels of type I IFNs [ 65 ]	1
15843	However , during WNV encephalitis , PLX5622 treatment also significantly decreased transcriptional expression of both TNF and IFNβ	1
15844	Together , our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism contributes impaired local reactivation of antiviral T cells within the CNS by depleting co - stimulatory signals including both B7 molecules and inflammatory cytokines .	1
15845	Although not included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease , this clinical manifestation is reported in up to 50 % of children with @DISEASE$ [ 7 ]	1
15846	In addition , the clinical find@GENE$ of BCG reactivation is regarded to be highly specific for @DISEASE$ , as it is very rarely described in other febrile illnesses or infections	1
15847	For example , in a study of febrile Japanese children aged < 2 years admitted over an 8month period with diagnoses other@GENE$ n @DISEASE$ , no BCG reactivations were observed [ 8 ]	1
15848	In contrast , data from a Japanese nationwide epidemiologic survey showed that > 70 % of children in this age group who were diagnos@GENE$ ith @DISEASE$ developed BCG reactivation [ 8 ]	1
15849	@DISEASE$ has not bee@GENE$ ported to cause BCG reactivation .	1
15850	The @DISEASE$ coronavirus ( @DISEASE$ CoV ) , a hitherto unknown β - coronavirus , emerged as a causative agent of a severe @DISEASE$ in humans in 2012	1
15851	This new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
15852	To date , the MERS - CoV still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [ 2 , 3 ]	1
15853	Epidemiological data suggest that the @DISEASE$ is endemic in Saudi Arabia , which accounts for the majority of primary community - acquired cases	1
15854	Many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with @DISEASE$ camels , the primary animal reservoir of @DISEASE$ CoV	1
15855	Alternatively , camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [ 4 , 5 ]	1
15856	Other outbreaks of @DISEASE$ have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
15857	Most of the @DISEASE$ infections occur within the Arabian Peninsula , i	1
15858	e	1
15859	, Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and United Arab Emirates , however @DISEASE$ cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [ 9 , 10 ] .	1
15860	The lack of robust studies on human pathological studies on cellular infiltrates in @DISEASE$ is likely explained by the necessary reliance on autopsy specimens	1
15861	A number of studies have noted lymphocytic infiltrates in samples from later timepoints	1
15862	Limited studies have shown that acute infiltrates develop over time with late fibrosis occurring in the intima and adventia layers	1
15863	Neutrophils seem to be the predominant initial cell infiltrate [ 80 ]	1
15864	However , in a series of six specimens , neutrophil infiltration was quickly followed by lymphocyte infiltrates , then mixed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates were demonstrated later , near day 19 of illness [ 81 ]	1
15865	In a separate series ( 8 specimens ) , early B lymphocyte infiltration after initial neutrophil infiltrate was confirmed [ 80 ]	1
15866	Prominent @DISEASE$ , similar to @DISEASE$ formation , have also been described , but these appear to occur at later timepoints ( > 3 weeks )	1
15867	These infiltrates consisted of T cells , macrophages , B cells and prevalent IgM + plasma cells , with less frequent IgA + plasma cells	1
15868	The authors compare these to similar B cell rich lesions driven by both superantigens an@GENE$ ecti@GENE$ 	1
15869	The incidence estimates of influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09associated PICU admissions , derived from active screening of @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$ , reached similarly high levels in the first and third postpandemic seasons	1
15870	Both incidence estimates were higher than those previously reported by nation - wide PICU surveillance for the pandemic and the first post - pandemic season , suggesting possible underreporting in previous studies without active screening	1
15871	Comparison of the first and third post - pandemic seasons indicated an age shift of severe A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 towards younger children , which might be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population	1
15872	The large proportion of children with underlying chronic conditions indicates the need for a more consistent implementation of the current recommendations for influenza vaccination of specific risk groups in Germany	1
15873	These children could also profit from herd protection , if universal influenza vaccination was successfully introduced in Germany	1

15879	Domestic cats are commonly affected by viral pathogens that induce lengthy infections with fatal outcomes	1
15880	Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries , where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts	1
15881	Oligonucleotides ( ODN ) containing @GENE$ of class A ( @GENE$ ) are highly potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms	1
15882	The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand - alone agents in the domestic cat	1
15883	@GENE$ stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) enhanced their proliferation , increased the presence of @GENE$ on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation	1
15884	Incubation of the supernatants of CpG - A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the @GENE$ in these target cells , which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families , namely Coronaviridae , Herpesviridae , Caliciviridae , Parvoviridae , and Retroviridae	1
15885	Most importantly , subcutaneous administration of CpG - A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of @GENE$ , reaching maximal levels within 24 h	1
15886	Plasma from treated cats could furthermore inhibit viral replication in vitro	1

15921	In - service training consists of hands - on opportunities for professional training and development to build specific scientific skill sets	1
15922	One Health networks , in particular , often foster multidisciplinary research that relies on the transfer of knowledge and skills between its members and across disciplines for their success	1
15923	In - service trainings , particularly through the sharing of best practices and standardized protocols and hands - on training , are meant to provide network members with an operational level of understanding on various subject matters , such that research activities can be replicated across both space and time	1
15924	The WAB - Net currently consists of two programs designed to equip network members with a diverse set of skills	1
15925	The first is " in - field trainings , " where local scientists are trained by expert @DISEASE$ ecologists on how to properly don and remove personal protective equipment ( PPE ) ; safely capture , handle , and identify local bat species ; and obtain non - lethal diagnostic samples ( e	1
15926	g	1
15927	, saliva , feces , blood , urine ) for virus detection	1
15928	The second is a " field - to - laboratory " research exchange , designed to expose local scientists to every aspect of a multidisciplinary research project ( ranging from field collection to laboratory methods to statistical and phylogenetic analyses )	1
15929	This is especially helpful in providing researchers of a given discipline ( e	1
15930	g	1
15931	, bat ecology , virology , epidemiology ) with a more complete view of what a cross - disciplinary research project entails	1
15932	Together , these trainings will promote collaboration and creativity , and provide participants with the skills and perspectives needed to better approach interdisciplinary One Health research .	1
15933	Aiming to have a better understanding of the complex various influencing factors for carbon emissions in Guangzhou city , we decomposed the total carbon emissions into two parts including the industrial sector and the residential sector .	1
15934	The innovation and contribution of this study compared with other references mainly lies in the following two aspects	1
15935	Firstly , city - level total carbon accounting approach based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table was established	1
15936	Secondly , driving factors including structural indicators , e	1
15937	g	1
15938	economic structure , energy structure , and population structure , were investigated systematically by adopting the newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity and the IDA theory	1
15939	It was aimed to provide theoretical references for making more targeted policies on energy saving and emission reduction in China ' s mega cities .	1
15940	A few participants articulated that rather than forcing a top - down policy approach , @DISEASE$ could be better tackled by the sharing of best practices through communities of practitioners and creating social movements to encourage and sustain behavior change .	1
15941	To investigate whether H5N1 virus could survive in the blow fly C	1
15942	nigribarbis , we monitored the titer of infectious virus in flies after they were exposed to the @DISEASE$ ( A / duck / Hyogo / 35 / 2001 ) [ 10 ]	1
15943	Fifty female blow flies ( Kyoto strain C	1
15944	nigribarbis ) , approximately 14 days old , were put into a 20 cm 3 fly cage for 3 h at 20 • C with a piece of cotton impregnated with 10 8 EID 50 / mL allantoic fluid from an H5N1 virus ( A / duck / Hyogo / 35 / 2001 [ 10 ] ) - infected egg diluted with MEM diluents [ 11 ]	1
15945	Following the 3 h virus exposure , the blow flies were individually reared at 20 • C or 10 • C until tested	1
15946	Incubation at 10 • C was chosen because the average temperature around Tamba Town was 3	1

15952	Virus - infected HeLa cells express @GENE$ in the cytoplasm after @DISEASE$ infection [ 30 ] and PRV infection results in @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in HeLa cells	1
15953	In addition , PRV results in @DISEASE$ cell formation as a PRV CPE [ 31 ] .	1
15954	3	1
15955	Is the interpretation ( discussion and conclusion ) well balanced and supported by the data ?	1
15956	A previous study predicted the pandemic potential of MERS - CoV to be ≤ 5 % ; however , this does not indicate that the risk has abated [ 30 ]	1
15957	Prerequisites for reducing the risk include improved surveillance , active contact tracing , and the initiation of animal host searching [ 30 , 31 ]	1
15958	During the outbreak in Korea , @DISEASE$ was classified as a notifiable @DISEASE$ disease and was subjected to surveillance [ 32 ]	1
15959	Since @DISEASE$ is an imported disease in Korea , it is recommended that precautions be taken before travel and that the time of returning from travel and incubation period be considered	1
15960	This study showed a low seropositivity in the population of individuals quarantined due to contact with @DISEASE$ cases	1
15961	However , there is a possibility that the seropositivity rate was underestimated for the following reasons	1
15962	Firstly , the participants of the present study were mostly non - healthcare workers and were relatively healthy	1
15963	Thus , the risk of infection was low	1
15964	Secondly , the overall participation rate was 48	1
15965	9 % , whereas it was 36	1
15966	8 % in the patient group at a higher risk of infection	1
15967	Moreover , we only surveyed 10	1
15968	9 % of the quarantined individuals	1
15969	Therefore , the actual rate of asymptomatic infections may be higher than reported in the present study	1
15970	Lastly , the present study may have been conducted too late	1
15971	In a previous study , MERS - CoV ELISA results indicated that the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset [ 33 ]	1
15972	Although no reports have analyzed the duration of antibody presence in @DISEASE$ patients regardless of symptoms , a recent study of severe @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for up to 2 - 3 years after infection [ 34 , 35 ]	1
15973	Blood sampling for serologic test in this study was performed on contacts between October and December 2015 , while exposure to the confirmed case occurred between May and June 2015 ( a gap of 5 months )	1
15974	Thus , a loss of the MERS - CoV antibody titer could have taken place despite actual asymptomatic infections ; therefore , the actual rate of asymptomatic infection may be higher than the rate presented in this report .	1
15975	@GENE$ have emerged as critical regulators of a large number of ubiquitin - dependent processes including synapse development and function	1
15976	Growing evidence indicates that DUB localization and activity are tightly controlled in vivo through proteinprotein interactions	1
15977	Here , we highlighted recent progress in our understanding of how @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , interact with and activate @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
15978	Future studies should reveal if @GENE$ and @GENE$ expression or subcellular localization are regulated in neurons as a mechanism to control @GENE$ function	1
15979	Understanding how @GENE$ function is regulated in vivo will provide critical information for the design of better drugs to fine - tune ubiquitin - regulation of protein trafficking or degradation of @GENE$	1
15980	Interestingly , although one human genetic study found no association between @GENE$ mutations and @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( Kushima et al	1
15981	, 2010 ) , another study identified USP46 as a @GENE$ ate gene associated with early - onset @DISEASE$ ( Liu et al	1
15982	, 2016 )	1
15983	It will be interesting to learn if mutations in USP46 or its regul@GENE$ are associated with other @DISEASE$ given the importance of USP46 in both glutamatergic and@GENE$ rgic signaling .	1

15995	The study demonstrates for the first time the simultaneous detection of viral and bacterial etiologies of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in under - 5 children in hospital - care settings in Dhaka , Bangladesh	1
15996	Major focal points of the study included ( a ) determination of seasonal variation in terms of @DISEASE$ specimen collection rates as well as seasonality of isolated @DISEASE$ pathogens , ( b ) in vitro antibiotic resistance / sensitivity assay for bacterial pathogens , ( c ) coinfection patterns , ( d ) age - dependent distribution patterns of pathogens , and ( e ) a comparison of the detection rates of respiratory pathogens between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases	1
15997	Knowing the seasonal variability of pathogens would help the parents or guardians of the children as well as physicians to adopt some preventive measures	1
15998	Antibiogram study was designed to know the condition of antibiotic resistance / sensitivity patterns of major @DISEASE$ bacterial pathogens to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics to treat @DISEASE$ patients , which also might help control of the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant strains	1
15999	Analysis of coinfection status was performed to identify major coinfection partners in terms of virus - bacteria , virusvirus , bacteria - bacteria , virus - bacteria - bacteria , and virus - virus - bacteria	1
16000	Especially specific identification of bacteria in a coinfection case may help the physicians to choose appropriate antibiotics and additional medications because bacterial coinfection , especially superinfection has been reported to associate with huge fatal outcomes and deaths of under - five @DISEASE$ patients	1
16001	On the other hand , age - dependent distribution patterns of pathogens are useful to identify vulnerable age groups .	1
16002	Next , the study focused on the detection of viral pathogens ( Tables 3 and 4 )	1
16003	RT - qPCR method was adopted to detect a panel of 10 different respiratory viruses	1
16004	About 79 % ( 158 / 200 ) of enrolled @DISEASE$ patients were laboratory - confirmed for @DISEASE$ with either single @DISEASE$ infections ( 54	1
16005	5 % ; n = 109 ) or infections with more than one viruses ( 24	1
16006	5 % ; n = 49 )	1
16007	Although the number of @DISEASE$ infected patients was 158 , the total number of virus detected in this study Modified disc diffusion method was used for profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility / resistance	1
16008	Bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of the inhibition zone interpretative , as manifested by CLSI .	1
16009	Common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) have high prevalence of @DISEASE$ throughout their large geographic range in Latin America [ 15 , 16 , 24 , 44 ]	1
16010	Vampire bats are of particular concern because they subsist on blood , which could create opportunities for @DISEASE$ transmission to humans and livestock either from bites during blood feeding or through vector sharing facilitated by close proximity [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]	1
16011	Here , we capitalize on a two - year , spatially replicated study of vampire bats to examine the genetic diversity and infection prevalence of @DISEASE$ , including its geographic structure across the vampire bat range as well as individual and temporal correlates of infection status	1
16012	To explore possible transmission routes of this bacterial pathogen , we also test for associations between bat fly infestation and @DISEASE$ infection status , which would support vector - borne transmission , and by screening bat saliva and fecal samples for evidence of Bart@GENE$ ich would support transmission through bites or grooming and environmental exposure to bacteria shed in feces , respectively .	1
16013	All unknown sample extracts were run in triplicate with one NTC for each sample using the optimised @GENE$ protocol	1
16014	Each reaction plate contained ( 1 ) a positive control for the @GENE$ , ( 2 ) a standardised calibrator sample ( 1 × 10 7 copies of reference and @GENE$ made up to 200 ng total DNA using @GENE$ ) and ( 3 ) a triplicate of a standard of known quantities of all @GENE$	1
16015	See Online Resource S4 for the layout of a typical sample plate	1
16016	One standard curve ( imported during software analysis ) was used for analysis of several qPCR plates , rather than making a standard curve for each plate ( allowing more samples per plate ) ; this allowed the standard within the plate to act as a reference on the standard curve while the calibrator acted as a reference for inter - plate variation ( see normalisation calculation below )	1
16017	The mean C p value was converted to a copy number and a normalised relative quantitative ratio ( RQ ) of the @GENE$ to @GENE$ was then calculated using the following equation :	1
16018	The greatest difficulty in addressing our hypotheses was our inability to determine the relative contributions of URT bacterial community structure and local host defenses on bacterial selection into the LRT	1
16019	In the simplest case , how much is the risk of @DISEASE$ following viral infection attributable to the presence of a known @DISEASE$ pathogen ( such as S	1
16020	pneumoniae ) in the URT ? To determine this , studies must examine timedependent carriage of bacteria , species - specific @DISEASE$ outcomes and the effects of viral coinfection among other known risk factors - which , to the best of our knowledge , do not currently exist	1
16021	Nonetheless , the literature strongly supports the presence of an interaction between @DISEASE$ infection and secondary @DISEASE$ ; the failure to fully understand the mechanisms should act as a spur for future studies while continuing current efforts to reduce the worldwide burden of @DISEASE$ .	1
16022	Even though each genomic segment has a slightly different mutation / substitution rate , strong , genome - wide patterns are evident , including a declining ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous codon changes ( dN / dS ) , a declining ratio of transition to transversion mutations ( Ti / Tv ) , and even changes in codon bias	1
16023	Additional file 1 includes these data on a segment - by - segment basis	1
16024	Figure 5 illustrates a continuous decline in the Ti / Tv ratio during the entire history of the human H1N1 lineage	1
16025	This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time , perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as extinction approaches	1
16026	A transversion is 2	1
16027	7 times more likely to cause a non - synonymous change than a transition , and is also more likely to change RNA 3 - dimensional configuration	1
16028	Since we do not see a change in the rate of accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time ( Figure 3 ) , we suspect that the heightened selection against transversions may be more strongly associated with RNA architectural constraints .	1
16029	Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL was an independent predictor of @DISEASE$ with an adjusted odds ratio of 13	1
16030	5 ( 95 % CI ; 2	1
16031	3 - 80	1
16032	4 ) ( Table 5 )	1

16038	In this paper , we examine an alternative point of view regarding mutation accumulation within H1N1	1
16039	We suggest that , while specific adaptive mutations commonly occur within the H1N1 virus , many more deleterious mutations are accumulating than beneficial mutations , even when there is strong selection	1
16040	Consequently , H1N1 appears to have been in very gradual error catastrophe throughout its history .	1
16041	LIV is mainly distributed in the UK and Ireland , but it has also been detected in sheep in Norway and on the Bornholm island in Denmark ( Figure 1 )	1
16042	LIV is most commonly known as pathogen of sheep and red grouse although humans can also get infected [ 17 , 56 ]	1
16043	Animals develop a febrile disease , which can progress to fatal @DISEASE$ [ 57 ]	1
16044	Like TBEV , the vector of LIV is the tick species Ixodes ricinus [ 57 ]	1
16045	Ticks transmit the virus to animals , however , natural exposure to humans is rare [ 33 ]	1
16046	Instead humans that are exposed to infected animals such as veterinarians , farmers , butchers , and abattoir workers , as well as laboratory scientists have acquired @DISEASE$ infection [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]	1
16047	In between the years of 1934 and 1991 , 31 human cases of LIV was described [ 62 ]	1
16048	In humans , LIV causes a disease that closely resembles @DISEASE$ , with initial flu - like symptoms which can progress to severe @DISEASE$	1
16049	Distinct but closely related viruses are also found in Spain ( Spanish @DISEASE$ ) , Turkey ( Turkish @DISEASE$ virus ) , and Greece ( Greek @DISEASE$ virus ) [ 33 ] .	1
16050	HEK293T cells were grown on 0 , 01 % poly - L - lysine coated coverslips and analyzed 24 hours post - transfection with @GENE$ coding : @GENE$ , @GENE$ plus @GENE$ , @GENE$ , a @GENE$ coding @GENE$ , as well as a small amount of @GENE$ ( ratio 3 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 0 , 1 )	1
16051	After Formalin fixation , cells were incubated with the following @GENE$ : @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , Sigma ) , followed by @GENE$ , or @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ )	1
16052	DAPI - containing mounting medium was finally used ( DAPI Fluormount G , Southern biotech )	1
16053	Images were acquired using a spectral Leica sp5 and analyzed with the Fiji software [ 54 ]	1
16054	Two - dimensional graphs representing pixel intensities ( gray level ) were plotted along a 30μm lines ( yellow on Figure 3B ) , using Plot Profile tool in Image - J	1
16055	The extent of reciprocal co - localization between @GENE$ and @GENE$ was quantified using the Manders overlap coefficient ( Fuji image software ) on more than 40 cells per condition .	1
16056	In order to obtain pure proteins , @GENE$ were used to transform E	1
16057	coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG	1
16058	The expressed proteins were purified with Ni 2 + - chelate affinity chromatography and a glutathione sepharose [UNK] 4B column	1
16059	Proteins were examined using SDS - PAGE ( Fig	1
16060	3 )	1
16061	The position of the protein bands was consistent with the expected molecular weight of the different HCV segments	1
16062	Protein concentration was determined by the @GENE$ method , using @GENE$ as the standard	1
16063	Our further analyses demonstrated that the @GENE$ were pure and that they could be used directly for the construction of the @GENE$ strip .	1
16064	Similar studies have been performed using bank vole cells infected with PUUV [ 78 ]	1
16065	Embryonic fibroblasts inoculated with PUUV did not express increased amounts of @GENE$ or @GENE$ , although non - related viruses were able to induce up - regulation of these genes	1
16066	This suggests , as with SEOV , PUUV efficiently antagonizes host innate responses in its natural reservoir .	1
16067	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is characterized by @DISEASE$ that can be caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary origins	1
16068	@DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ are the most common causes of @DISEASE$ [ 1 ]	1
16069	Predictors of survival include age , the type of underlying medical condition , the severity of @DISEASE$ , the presence of @DISEASE$ , and ongoing @DISEASE$ [ 2 ]	1
16070	Currently , clinical attempts to rescue @DISEASE$ patients include individualized ventilation and fluid management , adequate infection control , including early application of broad - spectrum anti - infectives , neuromuscular blockade using cisatracurium , sedation strategies , prone positioning , and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) to ensure oxygenation [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
16071	Although the incidence of @DISEASE$ is relatively high , with five to eight cases per 100 , 000 European inhabitants and even more in the USA , the various pathomechanisms are only partially understood , resulting in different experimental approaches to understand immune responses during early @DISEASE$ [ 6 ] .	1
16072	Among our patients , almost one - third had a previous diagnosis of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$	1
16073	Half of them were in the school age , meaning that they were the real @DISEASE$ of the case series , according to what is previously described by Stein and Martinez [ 23 ]	1
16074	For them , the chance of needing hospitalization was higher than their peers with no previous @DISEASE$ diagnosis	1
16075	Among this group of older children with known @DISEASE$ , up to 2 / 3 were not using controller medications , either for no prescription or for low compliance , and , according to our results , were at higher risk of a moderatesevere exacerbation than those using it	1
16076	Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent @DISEASE$ , and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for @DISEASE$ [ 21 , 24 ]	1
16077	Evaluating @DISEASE$ severity was beyond the goals of our study ; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 @DISEASE$ children aged over 5 years and not using long - term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription	1
16078	However , the fact that so many @DISEASE$ children were not using controller therapy , although our National Health System provides a pediatricsspecialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14 , seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of @DISEASE$ management .	1
16079	Despite the several limitations , our paper points out some important differences in @DISEASE$ exacerbations between preschool - and school - aged children concerning etiology and seasonal trends , specific for our climate	1
16080	It also highlights the need for an improved management of @DISEASE$ patients outside the ED and a tighter connection with outpatients ' services : individualized written action plans should always be available ; moreover , recommending vaccinations and allergen - avoidance measures might be useful , as well as prescribing controller medications at ED discharge in those patients with known @DISEASE$ and under no therapy .	1

16099	As opposed to previous studies we validated the software by comparing the results to frequencies obtained using the most accurate method for CBF calculation , directly counting individual ciliary beat cycles during slow - motion playback	1

16111	In our system the image capture instrument is not connected to the software , so analysis performed once the experiment is completed	1
16112	This allows the software to batch process groups of images using the same settings and thus reducing operator input	1
16113	This study has clearly demonstrated that @GENE$ is reliable system to analyze CBF	1
16114	In addition to the accurate measurement of ciliary beat frequency the @GENE$ system has a number of advantages	1
16115	It has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings when processing large datasets , it reduces operator error due to selection bias , and it accurately reports static cilia	1
16116	The latter is a significant advantage as immotile cilia may not be visible to the observer in multilayered cell cultures	1
16117	Furthermore , by focusing on particular ciliated areas , @GENE$ can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency .	1
16118	Overall , 216 patient , accounting for 118 ( 54	1
16119	6 % ) @DISEASE$ cases and 98 ( 45	1
16120	4 % ) controls , were analyzed	1
16121	Among them , 93 ( 44	1
16122	1 % ) were female	1
16123	The male / female gender ratio was 0	1
16124	79 , and median age was 11 months ( IQR : 5 - 55 months ) .	1
16125	The main strengths of our study were its prospective design with the inclusion of controls that permitted us to assess @DISEASE$ etiologies while taking into account the prevalence of pathogen detection in non - infected patients	1
16126	Ours is the first case - control investigation of @DISEASE$ etiology in children from Mali ( S1 STROBE checklist )	1
16127	The results should serve to better manage @DISEASE$ not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries	1
16128	Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory ( Lyon , France )	1
16129	In addition , this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of @DISEASE$ and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents	1
16130	Some limitations should be underlined	1
16131	First , microbiological diagnosis of @DISEASE$ is difficult due to the lack of single reliable test	1
16132	Then , at the individual level , it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization ; particularly for bacterial agents such as S	1
16133	pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage	1
16134	However , at the population level , addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children	1
16135	In a @DISEASE$ etiology study , it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle ( Ct ) values obtained from RT - PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of @DISEASE$ , according to the microorganism [ 30 ]	1
16136	Second , because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali , external validity might be limited	1
16137	However , Gabriel Touré University Hospital is a reference center in the country , and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako	1
16138	Third , study power was confined to detecting some linkages ( i	1

16143	Shortly , the patient became @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
16144	She was given normal saline boluses and dobutamine ( 10 mcg / kg / min ) and promptly transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU )	1
16145	There , she received cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( 13 minutes ) because of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
16146	She was ventilated and treated with intravenous cefotaxime , high dose ampicillin , vancomycin , clarithromycin , packed cell , fresh frozen plasma , and cryoprecipitate transfusions	1
16147	Abnormal laboratory findings included hemoglobulin 8	1

16153	Echocardiography showed reduced cardiac contractility ( ejection fraction 48 % ) but no @DISEASE$	1
16154	The pleural effusion was drained , and 40 mL of dark turbid fluid 2 Case Reports in Medicine yielded ( Figure 1 insert )	1
16155	Despite multiple inotrope infusions of dobutamine , adrenaline , noradrenaline , and milrinone , her mean blood pressure remained low ( 50 mmHg ) and she suffered another episode of @DISEASE$ 9 hours following admission	1
16156	Hemodiafiltration was instituted for intractable @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
16157	The patient ran a deteriorating course despite aggressive ICU support	1
16158	She developed another episode of @DISEASE$ and succumbed 39 hours following hospitalization	1
16159	Nasopha and tracheal aspirates yielded Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( by polymerase chain reaction PCR ) and human Metapneumovirus RNA ( by RT - PCR )	1
16160	Blood culture , pleural fluid , and tracheal aspirate yielded leucocytes and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( serotype 19A ) sensitive to cefotaxime and penicillin	1
16161	CSF was not obtained during the critical episode .	1
16162	Our data do not exclude the possibility that other genetic conflicts , perhaps in addition to viral conflicts , drove @GENE$ positive selection	1
16163	Indeed , the first discovery of manipulation of host processes by ADP - ribosylation emerged from the study of bacterial toxins ( e	1
16164	g	1
16165	, diphtheria , cholera toxins ) [ 49 ] , leaving open the possibility that bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens drove the evolution of @GENE$	1
16166	However , we hypothesize that viruses may be significant or even the primary pathogens in these evolutionary arms races for several reasons	1
16167	First , numerous viruses replicate poorly when ADP - ribosylation is inhibited , including viruses that replicate in the nucleus ( HSV ) [ 18 ] and cytoplasm ( vaccinia ) [ 17 ]	1
16168	Second , several families of mammalian RNA viruses , including corona - and togaviruses , have @GENE$ that contain @GENE$	1
16169	In both coronaand togaviruses , disruption of @GENE$ has been shown to reduce virulence [ 20 , 21 ] , and in the case of @DISEASE$ , this reduced virulence is due to increased sensitivity to the antiviral activity of interferon ( IFN @GENE$ 21 ]	1
16170	This suggests a simple model in which the macr@GENE$  least in coronaviruses ) are required to counteract some IFN @GENE$ though the identity of that IFN @GENE$ nknown , we note that several of the rapidly evolving PARP@GENE$ dentify here , including PARP@GENE$ RP@GENE$ PARP@GENE$ e upregulated by IFN @GENE$  , 51 ]	1
16171	Furthermore , overexpression of PARP@GENE$ dependent of IFN @GENE$  sufficient to upregulate several known antiviral effectors [ 50 ]	1
16172	Finally , overexpression of several PARP@GENE$ been shown to inhibit replication of viruses , the most well - described example being PARP@GENE$ ken together , we favor a model in Tables S6 - S8 )	1
16173	( B ) P - values derived from PAML tests of positive selection on all sequenced macr@GENE$ g either macr@GENE$ e , the entire gene minus the macr@GENE$ ust the cata@GENE$ lues in red indicate strong evidence of positive selection , while those in grey indicate a lack of statistically significant evidence for positive selection	1
16174	( C ) Phylogenetic tree of individual macrodomains from macro - PARPs , rooted using human MacroD2 as an outgroup	1
16175	Macrodomains in italics lack a C - terminal extension found in most macrodomains and lack one or more of the putative catalytic motifs required for ADP - ribosylhydrolase activity [ 16 ] ( Figure S5 )	1
16176	This suggests these macrodomains may be able to recognize , but are unlikely to catalyze removal of , ADP - ribosylation	1

16197	Recently , accumulated data have tried to unravel the potential molecular mechanisms of HCV entry	1
16198	Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies described the critical role of the association between @GENE$ and CLDN1 @GENE$ in HCV entry [ 104 , 105 ]	1
16199	Next , a rate - limiting role for @GENE$ in @DISEASE$ has been reported [ 106 ]	1
16200	The in vitro study demonstrated that increased SR -@GENE$ ession would enhance entry and internalization of HCV	1
16201	Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on clat@GENE$ diated endocytosis [ 107 , 108 ]	1
16202	After internalization , fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes	1
16203	Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [ 109 , 110 ]	1
16204	Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations , it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors .	1
16205	Several cell surface molecules of the target cells have been identified to interact with HCV , including @GENE$ , the @GENE$ , highly sulfated heparan sulfate ( HS ) , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , occludin ( @GENE$ ) .	1
16206	This is a prospective investigation of @DISEASE$ in under - five children in hospital - care settings in Dhaka city	1
16207	A total of 200 patients who had @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , as manifested by clinical signs and symptoms and / or chest X - ray report suggestive of @DISEASE$ admitted to the pediatric units of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital , were enrolled in this study over a period of 1 year from August 2014 to July 2015	1
16208	30 ( 15 from each of 2 hospitals ) asymptomatic under - five children who were admitted to the hospital because of complications other than @DISEASE$ were also enrolled during the study period	1
16209	Prior to enrollment , a written informed consent was obtained from each child ' s parents or legal guardians	1
16210	Patients with a history of @DISEASE$ or patients whose parents ' / guardians refused to give consent were excluded from the study	1
16211	In addition to name , address , height , weight and temperature , patients ' demographic data such as age and gender were recorded on a standard form at the time of specimen collection	1
16212	Vital signs including heart rate and respiratory rate were also recorded at the same time	1
16213	Nasal swab specimens were collected from each participant	1
16214	The study was conducted in the Institute for Developing Science and Health Initiatives ( IDESHI ) , Dhaka , Bangladesh	1

16216	Polyamines are small , positively - charged molecules that are abundant in eukaryotic cells	1
16217	Polyamines function in nucleotide metabolism , cell cycling , and cell signaling , among several other functions [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]	1
16218	Several compounds have been developed that specifically target polyamine metabolism , either by reducing their synthesis or enhancing their breakdown , and these compounds have been tested clinically for the treatment of @DISEASE$ and parasites [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
16219	Difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) , which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis , has received attention as an anti - trypanosomal molecule and is well - tolerated in patients [ 22 , 23 ]	1
16220	Polyamines are also crucial for @DISEASE$ , including CVB3 [ 24 ]	1
16221	Polyamine depletion via DFMO restricts @DISEASE$ infection , in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ]	1
16222	We previously described how @DISEASE$ rely on polyamines for viral translation and genome replication [ 26 ] ; however , whether similar processes are affected for other viruses and precisely how polyamines function during CVB3 replication remain to be completely understood .	1

16225	In our study , we described the clinical characteristics of Adv - positive @DISEASE$ in immunocompetent adult patients	1
16226	The most important findings were that Adv group patients had a longer duration of @DISEASE$ after symptom onset and admission , a higher mean body temperature at admission , a higher number of patients with a body temperature over 39 ° C Fig	1

16236	In addition , the instances of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ were greater in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv group patients , although in patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment , there was no difference between the two groups	1
16237	Some epidemiological studies of Adv in South Korea military trainees and personnel have been performed	1

16242	The proportion of patients with @DISEASE$ and the hospitalization rate did not differ between those with and without @DISEASE$	1
16243	However , @DISEASE$ - infected patients had a significantly higher risk of requiring intensive care or mechanical Table 3 Characteristics of @DISEASE$ and response to antipyretics between Adv , Non - Adv , and unknown pathogen group ventilator support	1
16244	These notable findings indicate that @DISEASE$ has been occasionally associated with mortality and morbidity with loss in combat strength and an increase in the cost of care .	1
16245	Confocal microscopy imaging	1
16246	Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer ( CB ; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0	1
16247	1 % saponin in PBS [UNK] / [UNK] ) for 30 min and then incubated with @GENE$ for 2 h	1
16248	After 3 washes with CB , the tissue was incubated for 1 h with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , Cambridge , UK ) was used for the detection of cilia	1
16249	Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] and incubated in 4 % PFA for 15 min	1
16250	In the second step , the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min	1
16251	Cells were incubated with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ for 2 h , followed by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
16252	For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC , Abcam ' s Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit ( Fluorometric - Blue ) - CytoPainter was applied for 30 min , and then cells were washed with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] and fixed with 4 % PFA , followed by an incubation with @GENE$ as described before and labeling with @GENE$ conjugated with AF555 ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) for 1 h	1
16253	As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 ( C - Cas3 ) staining , apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; Becton , Dickinson )	1
16254	For detection of apoptotic cells , inserts were fixed with 4 % PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min , incubated with anti - C - Cas3 ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) , anti - flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h , washed , and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647 , Alexa Fluor 633 - coupled goat anti - rabbit IgG , and Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled anti - IgG2a ( Thermo Fisher ) for 1 h	1
16255	All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark	1
16256	For each staining , 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma ) at 2 g / ml was applied for 5 min at 37 ° C and washed off with PBS Ϫ / Ϫ	1
16257	Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4 - 88 reagent ( Sigma )	1

16261	The image acquisitions were performed with the 40ϫ objective , sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed ; in order to give high - resolution images , the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold	1

16265	To avoid false - positive emissions , different settings were applied , including background subtraction , threshold applications , gamma correction , and maxima	1
16266	Insert surface staining ( for E protein , CytoPainter , and C - Cas3 ) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy .	1
16267	For these experiments , we used two different strains of @DISEASE$ , the Nakayama strain , originally isolated in 1935 ( 66 ) , and the more recent Laos strain ( 67 )	1
16268	Our results demonstrate a higher infectivity and level of replication for the Laos strain in both porcine NEC and macrophages	1
16269	Associated with this was also a higher level of induced innate immune responses in epithelial cells	1
16270	The reason for these strain - related differences is unknown , and strain and genotype effects require further investigations .	1
16271	Bartonella was detected by PCR in all nine sites in each year , with prevalence ranging from 30 - 100 % ( Fig 4 ) .	1
16272	Bat forearm size , sex , and reproductive status were important predictors of @DISEASE$ status , with odds of infection being higher in larger , male , and non - reproductive bats	1
16273	While subadult status itself was not an important predictor of @DISEASE$ , these findings could suggest higher risk in young male bats that are relatively large for their age	1
16274	Our previous work has shown stronger innate immune defense ( i	1
16275	e	1
16276	, bacterial killing ability ) in reproductive ( mostly male ) vampire bats , also suggesting greater susceptibility of non - reproductive hosts [ 49 ]	1
16277	Similarly , subadults across a Mexican bat community also had higher odds of @DISEASE$ [ 16 ] , and young male vampire bats play key roles in the long - distance dispersal of @DISEASE$ virus [ 43 ] and display higher rates of @DISEASE$ exposure , possibly owing to more direct contacts during the first year of life [ 75 ]	1
16278	Larger forearm size could also relate to direct contact if larger bats are more dominant and aggressive , as found in other @DISEASE$ bat species [ 76 ] .	1
16279	We have previously identified all the verified and putative @GENE$ in eukaryotic model organisms	1
16280	28 We also compared the enrichment of @GENE$ in viruses infecting some of the model organisms ( human , mouse , rat , and chicken ) ( Table S3 )	1
16281	Two hypergeometric tests have been conducted to compare the enrichment fold of @GENE$ in viruses against the host : one for proteins containing all combination of @GENE$ ( i	1
16282	e	1
16283	, either @GENE$ or @GENE$ , or both kind ) and another considering only the proteins containing at least one @GENE$ ( i	1
16284	e	1
16285	, @GENE$ alone or along with one or more @GENE$ )	1
16286	We observed that when all the possible combinations of @GENE$ are taken into account , there is an enrichment of @GENE$ in viruses compared with the host organism for all 4 model organisms tested	1
16287	However , there is an enrichment of @GENE$ in the host compared with the infecting viruses .	1

16290	Incorporating known structural information can improve the accuracy of structure prediction	1
16291	For example , Mathews et al	1
16292	[ 45 ] used @GENE$ reactivity data to improve the prediction accuracy from 26	1
16293	3 % to 86	1
16294	8 % for @GENE$ of E	1
16295	coli	1
16296	Roughly , the larger the @GENE$ reactivity value for a given nucleotide , the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure	1
16297	However , limited @GENE$ reactivity data is available , and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or , if it is paired , to what other nucleotide	1
16298	Deigan et al	1
16299	[ 46 ] created pseudo energy terms from @GENE$ reactivity data , as a means of integrating such data into prediction software	1
16300	They reported prediction accuracy of 96 % to 100 % for three @GENE$ ( < 200 nucleotides ) and for @GENE$ ( 1500 nucleotides )	1
16301	ShapeKnots [ 47 ] is a new method for incorporating @GENE$ reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al	1

16307	1038 / s41598 - 017 - 01542 - 5 addition to providing @GENE$ specificity for @GENE$ , our global analysis revealed numerous non - prime - side specificity features	1
16308	In particular , these features include , among others , a significant preference for certain hydrophobic residues ( such as tryptophan , phenylalanine , and proline ) at the P4 ′ position , a preference for serine / threonine or phenylalanine at the @GENE$ and @GENE$ positions , and a decreased preference for proline at the @GENE$ ′ position ( Fig	1
16309	1A , B , and Supplemental Figure 2 )	1
16310	Structural basis for APN @GENE$ substrate specificity	1
16311	To provide a molecular basis for @GENE$ substrate recognition and catalysis , crystal structures were solved of @GENE$ bound to natural free amino acids with varied P1 preferences ( methionine , leucine , arginine , glycine , isoleucine , and aspartic acid ) to probe the influences of the extended @GENE$	1
16312	Due to the nearly identical architecture of the @GENE$ sites and @GENE$ specificities of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , @GENE$ was used for analysis because of its propensity to form high quality crystals 5 , 6	1
16313	The crystal structure of @GENE$ in complex with the free amino acid alanine and a seven amino acid poly - alanine peptide substrate were initially determined ( Figure 2 )	1
16314	The @GENE$ of @GENE$ contains 4 domains , head , side , body , and tail ( Fig	1
16315	2A )	1
16316	The N - terminal residue of peptide substrates is firmly anchored in the @GENE$ of @GENE$ between the @GENE$ with residues Gln208 , Glu350 and Glu406 forming hydrogen bonds with the free N - terminal amine group ( Fig	1
16317	2B , C )	1
16318	The nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond forms a hydrogen bond with the electron - repelling carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 , while the carbonyl oxygen of the scissile peptide bond interacts with the electron - attracting zinc and Tyr472 ( Fig	1
16319	2B , C )	1
16320	The resonating electrons of the scissile peptide bond are pulled towards the carbonyl oxygen , thus , destabilizing the bond and making it available to nucleophilic attack by the zinc - activated water molecule	1
16321	At the same time , the activated nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond is also ready to accept a proton from the catalytic water through the side chain of Glu384	1
16322	In the presence of free alanine , the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from pAPN maintains a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of the free alanine , suggesting that the carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine near Ala348 is protonated	1
16323	Protonation of this carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine is due to simultaneous deprotonation of the other carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine by zinc and Tyr472 ( Fig	1

16326	Although other papers have experimentally proven a causative relationship between the replication of H9N2 viruses in the oviduct of layers and changes in the quality and number of laid eggs [ 18 , 19 ] , their focus was limited to 1 week after the infection of SPF White Leghorn hens , and no microbiological examination was performed .	1
16327	While the climate of South America is particularly suitable for replication of the Aedes mosquito - the vector responsible for transmission of the @DISEASE$ ( Gyawali et al	1
16328	2016 ) , climate change is thought to have resulted in extremely heavy rainfall and droughts which can support this proliferation of mosquitos , hence facilitating the spread of the @DISEASE$ epidemic ( Fast et al	1
16329	2015 )	1
16330	Both the puddles created during heavy rainfall and the open barrel water storage during droughts , create ideal breeding places for mosquitos ( Fast et al	1
16331	2015 )	1
16332	Since the causes of climate change are complex , global , and political , the responses are political , often emphasizing the symptoms of climate change at a local level ( in especially the poor countries ) , rather than addressing the causes at a global level .	1
16333	Some of the literature attributed the lack of public health infrastructure and resources to respond to the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Brazil to these inequalities with regard to who is most affected	1
16334	Contrasting @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ , since @DISEASE$ initially affected the prestigious population , such as celebrities , doctors , scientists ( Lotufo 2016 ) , they were able to advocate and secure increased public funding of @DISEASE$ interventions from the Ministry of Health and State Departments of Health	1
16335	However , this seems to have happened at the expense of funding for vector control programs , such as those controlling mosquito vectors responsible for the transmission of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , which mostly affected poorer communities ( Lotufo 2016 ) .	1
16336	In the likelihood analysis , all the susceptible passengers were divided into several groups , and passengers with similar intake fractions were grouped in the same group	1
16337	Maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) was then determined to identify the value of quanta generation rate that was most likely to be the true value [ 49 ]	1
16338	The case with the MLE can be regarded as the case that best fits the outcome of the outbreak	1
16339	The likelihood can be estimated as followed :	1
16340	From Figure 2 ( a ) , similar trends can be found for all cases	1
16341	The average lateral positions first increase to 3	1
16342	61 m in 0	1
16343	8 s after the injections and then keep decreasing	1
16344	Higher moving speeds lead to a slower decreasing rate	1
16345	In the computational geometry , the index patient was seated at X = 3	1
16346	585 m and the position of the centerline was X = 2	1
16347	29 m	1
16348	So Figure 2 ( a ) suggest that the airflow induced by human movement will slightly prevent the aerosols from moving across the aisle of the airplane cabin	1
16349	Figure 2 ( b ) shows that the average longitudinal position keeps increasing after the injections for case 1 ~ 3	1
16350	Since the airflow from front to back of the cabin ( longitudinal direction ) is minimal [ 6 , 7 ] , the longitudinal movement of the aerosols of case 1 is mainly due to the initial momentum given by the cough	1
16351	Figure 2 ( b ) also indicates that human movement may enhance the mixing of room air in the airplane cabin , which may result in the transport of the aerosols along the moving path in both the positive and negative longitudinal direction , not only following the coughing direction or the moving direction	1
16352	This is also proven by the results of Exposure assessment shown in Section 3	1
16353	3 , in which the aerosol concentrations in the breathing zones of the passengers who are seated ahead and behind the index patient will increase after the movement of the standing person	1
16354	As shown in Figure 2 ( c ) , the average vertical position of case 1 remains at about 1	1
16355	20 m and starts to fluctuate after 25 s	1
16356	But for case 2 and 3 , it keeps decreasing and is lower than 0	1
16357	5 m after 40 s	1
16358	So human movement may cause the suspended aerosols to fall down to the ground and result in a downward transport effect	1
16359	During human walking , apparent downwash flow and downward contaminant transport can be found in the wake behind the torso of the human body [ 9 ]	1
16360	Thus the downward transport of the aerosols may be mainly due to flow characteristics of the wake behind the human body	1
16361	In an airplane cabin , not only the ventilation system but also the wake of a moving human can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols	1
16362	Higher moving speed may have a stronger downward transport effect .	1
16363	The first exposure reduction scenario is defined as finding the health - based optimum ventilation rate without any other actions that change indoor or outdoor sources	1
16364	In this scenario the pollutant concentrations from indoor and outdoor sources compete so that pollutants from indoor sources are decreasing and pollutants from the outdoor sources are increasing when the ventilation rate is increased	1
16365	The health - based - 10 - optimum level of ventilation is solved for each country among EU - 26 by calculating burden of disease with ventilation rates from 0	1

16367	Failure to vaccinate or inadequate or inappropriate vaccination in shelter - housed cats were major contributors to the re - emergence of @DISEASE$ in Australia	1
16368	Before these outbreaks , over half of the shelters from which cases were derived did not administer FPV vaccinations	1
16369	In general , FPV vaccines are a highly effective tool in @DISEASE$ control	1
16370	For example , protective FPV antibody titres were measured in 95 % of vaccinated cats in a field study of adult cats after MLV vaccination , of which 64 % had pre - existing protective titres [ 35 ]	1
16371	In addition , viral challenge studies of FPV - vaccinated cats usually show vaccine efficacy > 90 % [ 36 ]	1
16372	Although state legislation mandates vaccination of owned cats in commercial boarding facilities in NSW and Victoria , vaccination is not enforced for cats admitted to private or municipal animal shelters , until they are sold for rehoming	1
16373	Most shelters that did vaccinate , completed the primary course of vaccinations in kittens by 12 to 14 weeks of age and used inactivated vaccines , in contravention of the current guidelines	1
16374	The World Small Animal Veterinary Association ( WSAVA ) Vaccination Guidelines recommend the use of MLV vaccines in shelter - housed cats for rapid induction of long - lasting humoral immunity [ 22 , 37 ]	1
16375	A minimum age of 16 weeks for the final vaccination in the primary course is recommended , based on the failure of 45 % of kittens to seroconvert after vaccinations at 8 and 12 weeks of age with the commercial FPV MLV vaccination [ 37 , 38 ]	1
16376	This immunity gap relates to persis@GENE$ di@GENE$  MDA ) in kittens , which decline below protective titres yet effectively neutralize the vaccine virus and thereby prevent seroconversion [ 38 ]	1
16377	Persistent MDA would explain the presence of vaccination non - responders in our study that were < 16 weeks of age at the time of diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , highlighting that vaccination alone cannot prevent disease in environments where susceptible kittens are exposed to FPV .	1
16378	Polioviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and are classified as human enterovirus C ( HEV - C ) species in the genus Enterovirus according to the current taxonomy [ 15 , 16 ]	1
16379	Polioviruses can be divided into three different genotypes : 1 , 2 and 3	1
16380	The genome of each genotypes contains a single @GENE$ with a size of approximately 6 kb consisting of a single large @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) flanked by @GENE$ [ 17 ] .	1
16381	To further determine whether the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ also possesses @GENE$ - antagonizing activity , we utilized the knowledge that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ is fully responsible for its suppression effect 32	1
16382	The swab samples received were blended in the transport medium by vortexing and 400µL of this blend was used to extract @GENE$ acid	1
16383	Nucleic acid extraction was performed according to supplier ' s instructions on EZ1 Biorobot ( Qiagen Inc	1

16389	In order to further promote the negative effects of the economic structure effect ( s - effect ) , the energy intensity effect of production ( e - effect - Production ) , and the carbon intensity effect of production ( f - effect - Production ) , Guangzhou should pay more efforts to the optimization of energy consumption structure and industrial structure at the industrial sector	1
16390	( 1 ) Coal consumption in energy mix should be further decreased , while relatively low carbon energy such as natural gas should be accelerated both in the industrial and residential sectors	1
16391	Renewable energy such as solar PV and hydropower should also be encouraged	1
16392	( 2 ) Efficiency of thermal power generation should be further improved in Guangzhou , especially the major power plants such as the Pearl River power plant and the Huarun power plant in Nansha district , the Guangzhou power plant in Liwan district , the Hengyun power plant , the Huangpu power plant , and the Ruiming power plant in Huangpu district	1
16393	( 3 ) Energy consumption structure and energy utilization technique should be also effectively optimized and improved , especially in the pillar industries ( i	1

16395	electronic information manufacturing industry , automobile industry , and petrochemical industry ) , the traditional advantage industries ( i	1

16402	Compared to countries with greater research effort on bats and bat - associated viruses ( i	1
16403	e	1
16404	, China , United States , Australia , and some European countries ) ( Figures 3 , 5 and 6 ) , Western Asia faces diverse systemic challenges that likely impede similar research in the region	1
16405	Notably , ongoing armed conflict in several Western Asia countries , ranging from war in Afghanistan , Syria , and Yemen to political instability in Iraq and Lebanon to Islamist militancy in Pakistan [ 131 ] , threaten the safety of wildlife researchers and have deprioritized government investments in wildlife or zoonotic disease research	1
16406	Tragically , these conflicts have also directly impacted wildlife researchers , including the murder of a prominent mammalogist ( and bat researcher ) in Syria for unknown reasons [ 132 ] , as well as the continued imprisonment of nine Iranian researchers on suspicion of espionage , a crime punishable by death , for using camera traps to monitor the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah [ 133 ]	1
16407	On the other hand , socio - political turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security	1
16408	Yet , despite investments by local and foreign governments to support biosafety and biosecurity programs in the region , there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across Western Asia [ 134 ]	1
16409	Furthermore , until very recently , this region was a low priority for wildlife research funding , and what funding was available for wildlife research was targeted to the conservation of more charismatic species ( e	1
16410	g	1
16411	, Arabian Oryx , Asiatic cheetah )	1

16414	" The primary source for us (	1
16415	.	1
16416	) is , of course , our hospitals , also hospital effluents	1
16417	We know that there are very high concentrations of all these last resort antibiotics , especially from the ICUs ( Intensive Care Units ) and all that , and it gets into the wastewater which then goes into the sewerage system , all the way to the wastewater treatment plant	1
16418	" - I14 , Environment Health Also , there was a scope for improving the wastewater treatment standard to treat some antibiotic residues so that they do not harbor AMR .	1
16419	The finding that @GENE$ from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids obtained from @DISEASE$ - infected individuals mediate enhanced transcytosis of infectious virus further suggests the biological relevance of our results	1
16420	Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of , 3 mg / ml and up to , 15 mg / @GENE$ c IgG [ 18 ]	1
16421	Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV - 1 at 5 mg / ml	1
16422	Moreover , all of our samples mediated transcytosis at # 12	1
16423	5 mg / ml of @GENE$ l IgG , well below @GENE$ l IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of @DISEASE$ men and women [ 18 ]	1
16424	Even during @DISEASE$ , when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest , 23 of 23 subjects ( 100 % ) were reported to have anti -@GENE$  % had anti -@GENE$ vicovaginal and seminal fluids [ 17 ]	1
16425	Anti -@GENE$  were on average 11 - fold higher than gp41 -@GENE$  ; anti -@GENE$ und less frequently and in lower quantity	1
16426	Thus , HIV - @GENE$ kely to occur in mucosal secretions , are likely to contain predominantly IgG , @GENE$ under acidic conditions , would be subject to FcRn -@GENE$ ated transcytosis in an exposed host .	1
16427	In summary , we have demonstrated that @GENE$ mediates enhanced transcytosis of HIV - 1 in the presence of low pH and @GENE$	1
16428	We have also shown that @GENE$ is present on epithelial cells in areas of the genital tract that are potentially exposed to HIV - 1 during sexual intercourse	1
16429	Our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV - 1 may be facilitated .	1

16435	Figure 6 displays the difference of actual specificity ( calculated using the training data ) and the nominal specificity ( predetermined 1 - α ) for different values of α	1
16436	Curves above or below the horizontal dotted line at zero , indicate departures from the nominal α	1
16437	The Chicago series preserves the nominal value of the specificity ( curves are clustered around the zero line )	1
16438	For the Minneapolis - St	1
16439	Paul series the actual specificity is biased downwards , and for the other cities , the departure from the nominal value changes as α increases	1
16440	The choice of filter affected the calibration	1
16441	To understand the tradeoff between the specificity and the sensitivity we show the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curves , for each city , in Figure 7	1
16442	For all cities , the 1 - day filter has the poorest sensitivity	1
16443	Except for Milwaukee , the 7 - day filter tends to have higher sensitivities compared to the other filters , but also tends to have the poorest specificity	1
16444	The exponential filter balances the specificity - sensitivity tradeoff	1
16445	Tables 2 and 3 display , respectively , the median and maximum detection times for each filter and city for our model	1
16446	The 1 - day filter performed poorly	1
16447	The other filters are more comparable	1
16448	We observed ( results not shown ) that the time to detection increases if the attack rate is reduced and also if the probabilities of entering the ED is delayed .	1
16449	Our intention in this study was to find a flexible set of statistical models that could be applied across a number of emergency departments	1
16450	We employ time series models that include covariates , such as patient visit counts and ambient temperature , as well as random seasonal terms	1
16451	We use chest - radiograph ordering data from emergency departments of five regional Midwest children ' s hospitals to detect signatures of respiratory outbreaks	1
16452	We include visit counts series as a covariate in the chest radiograph model to account for variations due to , for example , ED sizes , changes of staff within the ED , and even some seasonalities across the time period of interest	1
16453	We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the influenza season - the colder months in the western hemisphere	1
16454	This is a more accurate measure of the influenza season than using a fixed covariate such as a sinusoid	1
16455	To reflect uncertainty in the variation of the influenza background over seasons , these models allow for randomness in the seasonal components	1
16456	The use of random seasonal components is an advantage over traditional fixed effect models , since temporal patterns are not assumed to repeat precisely the same way	1
16457	Thus , signature detection capabilities are improved for the majority of EDs - sensitivity is higher	1
16458	For increased accuracy and timeliness , the use of our model for the data analysis should represent one component of an integrated detection system	1
16459	Once a signal is triggered by any of our models , we recommend the use of clinical follow - up to corroborate or refute the emergence of a bona fide epidemic	1
16460	For example , radiographs and medical charts will need to be reviewed to identify highly anomalous findings or groupings of aberrant findings that would be expected to be present at early stages of outbreaks	1
16461	We believe that the approach utilized in this work will aid in this process and is more appropriate than models using fixed periodicities that do not have the ability to capture the underlying variabilities across seasons .	1
16462	Although the viruses are the most common etiological agents of @DISEASE$ , a wide variety of bacterial pathogens are also associated with @DISEASE$ either as single or mixed agents with viruses	1
16463	The bacterial etiology is not investigated in most of the @DISEASE$ - associated studies	1
16464	Even in countries like the USA where @DISEASE$ surveillance is routinely conducted , the bacterial etiology is not recorded in 65 - 85 % of hospitalized @DISEASE$ cases [ 23 , 24 ]	1
16465	It cannot be rule out that the presence of bacteria as coinfection partners with viruses may complicate the clinical symptoms of @DISEASE$ illness leading to fatal outcomes	1
16466	As such , the study was designed to focus not only on bacterial detection but also on antibiotic sensitivity / resistance patterns of the isolated bacterial strains .	1
16467	@GENE$ : sequence name annotation - based designer	1
16468	1	1
16469	The subsystems strategy , adopted as the guiding principle of the effort [ 16 ] , centers on leveraging expert annotations to define a small set of functional roles in all @GENE$ rather than all the functional roles in a small number of genomes	1
16470	2	1
16471	The subsystem effort provided a convenient framework for the curation of a set of protein families that became known as @GENE$ [ 22 , 23 ] , intended to contain only isofunctional homologsthat is , each family was intended to contain only @GENE$ playing the same functional role	1
16472	When errors in @GENE$ are detected , the underlying subsystems are updated and then the @GENE$ are regenerated to correct those errors	1
16473	The rapid evolution of the @GENE$ collection has made possible a number of the services described in this article	1
16474	3	1
16475	Using @GENE$ and @GENE$ as the underlying technology , the @GENE$ server was developed and made available in 2007 [ 23 ]	1
16476	Thousands of @GENE$ have been annotated with the @GENE$ system , and hundreds more are being annotated each week	1
16477	4	1
16478	The high - quality annotations generated by @GENE$ together with the ability to manually modify those annotations by human experts allowed for the automatic generation of genome - scale metabolic models in the Model SEED [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] .	1
16479	The Perl distribution contains the following : Client Packages .	1
16480	Over the history of the human H1N1 lineage , the accumulation of non - synonymous mutations was highly linear , after correcting the " frozen " samples for 21 years of dormancy ( Figure 3 )	1
16481	While it is true that this simple distance metric applied to amino acid changes would be expected to underestimate evolutionary relationships at large distances due to an increasing likelihood of multiple changes at individual @GENE$ , applying the standard Poisson or Gamma corrections [ 60 ] made no improvement to the fit of the regression to two significant figures	1
16482	We therefore conclude that the relationship is indeed linear , at least over the sampled timescale .	1
16483	Multiplex assay performance was further quantified using necropsy tissue samples with the aim of quantifying the infection load of tissues from red squirrel carcasses found during autumn 2011	1
16484	Some squirrels were suspected to have SQPVor @DISEASE$ based on gross lesions ( @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , respectively ) , while three red squirrels had no sign of disease ( i	1

16486	road casualties ) and three red squirrels were selected on the basis that they had gross lesions not traditionally associated with either @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , respectively )	1
16487	As grey squirrels rarely show clinical signs for either infection , 16 carcases were selected at random from samples submitted as part of a grey squirrel control programme ( during autumn 2011 )	1
16488	All squirrels had a systematic necropsy examination	1

16501	Introduction Bats ( Order : Chiroptera ) serve as reservoir hosts for viruses of concern for human and animal health [ 1 , 2 ] including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ virus , filoviruses , and henipaviruses [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]	1
16502	Bats can also harbor protozoa and bacteria of potential zoonotic relevance [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
16503	Bartonella spp	1
16504	are of particular interest , as these Gram - negative bacteria cause @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in both humans and livestock [ 10 , 11 ] and exhibit high genetic diversity in bats across multiple continents and species [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]	1
16505	Moreover , phylogenetic analyses show bats are reservoirs of zoonotic Candidatus B	1

16507	Ultra - Deep Sequencing of Intra - host @DISEASE$ Virus Populations during Cross - species Transmission	1
16508	To identify causal infections , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) samples , blood cultures , urinary samples , and perioperative samples were analyzed	1
16509	In patients at risk , PCR for atypical pathogens was also performed in BAL samples	1
16510	Infection was defined as > 10 6 colony - forming units ( CFU ) in BAL and / or urinary cultures	1
16511	For blood cultures , any replicate of bacterial growth was defined as infection	1
16512	During flu season , @DISEASE$ was detected by PCR	1
16513	BAL samples were also analyzed for other viral pathogens , such as @DISEASE$ ( CMV ) and @DISEASE$ ( HSV )	1
16514	Positive findings for these viruses were confirmed by cell cultures	1
16515	Patients with unknown pathogens and immune suppression were additionally screened for other pathogens .	1
16516	Based on a combination of three biological replicates from two mocks and five infected samples , the @GENE$ analysis identified a total of 3 , 224 proteins	1
16517	Proteins were designated as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) if they had expression fold - change ratios ≥ 1	1
16518	2 or ≤ 0	1
16519	833 and the p - value was less than 0	1
16520	05	1
16521	By two statistical methods , we identified 615 @GENE$ during the entire infection process by method 1 and 437 @GENE$ for all five time points by method 2 ( Fig	1
16522	2c )	1
16523	As shown in Fig	1
16524	2a1 , a2 , a total of 679 @GENE$ were identified by combining the two selection methods , which was greater than the number identified by each of the individual methods	1
16525	Among the 679 @GENE$ , 373 proteins were identified by both methods .	1
16526	ARTICLE In vivo protection against @DISEASE$ and pathogenesis through passive antibody transfer and active immunisation with a prMEnv DNA vaccine	1
16527	According to the findings of this study it was revealed that nurses feared contracting @DISEASE$	1
16528	Even though participants were provided with personal protective materials they were of poor quality	1
16529	Participants seemed to be more concerned about their safety in the wards and they appeared to be more stressed and emotional about the danger that they are exposed to in the wards	1
16530	A study done by Engelbrecht et al	1
16531	[ 23 ] reveals that nurses consider themselves more vulnerable and at high risk of contracting infection .	1
16532	According to the findings of this study , there is a shortage of equipment and working resources were impacting the quality of health in the @DISEASE$ wards	1
16533	Participants appeared to be scared and were discouraged by the poor supply of resources in the wards	1
16534	There was poor supply of N95 respiratory masks , UV lights were not regularly serviced , and there were no fans and air conditioners in the wards	1
16535	The wards had small windows	1
16536	There was also poor hygiene practice since there was a poor supply of detergents and hand washing soap	1
16537	A study done by Mosadeghrad [ 19 ] concludes that inadequate or non - available facilities , equipment , and resources , especially basic resources to provide services such as water , steam , and electricity , hindered the provision of quality healthcare , proper conduct of tests , therapies , investigations , and surgery	1
16538	Another study done by Reilly [ 20 ] , concluded that patients are almost twice as likely to die in some hospitals because they lack the proper equipment and resources .	1
16539	Moreover , specific allergen - avoidance measures should also be addressed to all sensitized patients , for example , removing furry animals from the house in case of @DISEASE$ , encasing mattresses in allergen - impermeable covers to reduce house dust mites exposure , cleaning from surfaces indoor molds using bleach solutions , and reducing pollen indoor exposure by closing windows and doors during high pollen counts in @DISEASE$ patients [ 29 ] .	1
16540	Patients with severe @DISEASE$ treated with ECMO therapy between January 2012 and January 2016 at our institution were analyzed retrospectively	1
16541	In all patients , ECMO therapy was required due to @DISEASE$ and / or increased pulmonary resistance precluding protective lung ventilation .	1

16590	There is no specific information on the transmission of @DISEASE$ spp	1
16591	to cats	1
16592	However , due to the extensive data on vectorial transmission of the @DISEASE$ group of protozoal parasites to vertebrates , there is no doubt that the essential mode of transmission is by bites of infectious phlebotomine sand flies as for other vertebrate species	1
16593	This means that in areas where L	1
16594	infantum is transmitted to dogs , cats are likely to be in contact with the parasite and can also be potentially infected	1
16595	The sand fly vectors appear to be more permissive in their blood source preferences than thought before	1
16596	Several studies have demonstrated that cats constitute sources of blood for sand flies [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]	1
16597	Moreover , the experimental demonstration of infectiousness of two infected cats to sand flies [ 11 , 20 ] indirectly proves the ability of the vector to properly complete feeding on cats and acquire infection .	1
16598	Conclusions : This case control study , the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease , has identified the most important risk factors associated with @DISEASE$ to be eating ' high risk ' dishes popular in parts of Asia , occupational exposure to pigs and pig products , and preparation of pork in the presence of @DISEASE$	1

16615	Serious concerns have been raised by the recent spread of @DISEASE$ and its associated pathogenesis in humans	1
16616	Currently , there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for this emerging infectious agent	1
16617	Very recently , a collection of experimental ZIKV vaccines have been shown to lower viral load post challenge in nonpathogenic animal infection models	1
16618	21 , 22 These data are encouraging	1
16619	In this regard , it is important to examine additional novel vaccine approaches targe@GENE$ ZIKA in additional models that similar to susceptible humans , might show disease	1
16620	Here we evaluated a synthetic DNA vaccine , designed to express a novel consensus ZIKV - prM and E antigen , for immunogenicity following electroporation - enhanced immunisation in mice and non - human primates	1
16621	We observed that ZIKV - prME DNA vaccination was immunogenic and generated antigen - specific T cells and binding@GENE$ dies in both mice and NHPs	1
16622	Uniquely , the NHPs were immunised with ZIKV - prME through electroporation by the intradermal route , which uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i	1
16623	m	1
16624	electroporation , as we have recently described	1
16625	23 Further study of such approaches may provide advantages in clinical settings .	1
16626	Many investigators identified potent PPMO activity in cell culture assays and went on to test their antiviral properties in murine experimental models	1
16627	Most of the investigators explored both the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of PPMO and the best protection was usually achieved with pre - infection and post - infection PPMO treatments	1
16628	PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication , attenuate symptoms of disease in and / or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [ 67 ] , DENV [ 70 ] , MHV [ 63 ] , PV1 [ 75 ] , CVB3 [ 76 ] , VEEV [ 77 ] , EBOV [ 64 , 78 ] , RSV [ 79 ] , and FLUAV [ 82 , 83 ]	1
16629	Some PPMOs demonstrated very profound and impressive antiviral effects	1
16630	In particular , two 5 - μg pre - infection doses of ( RX 8 ) B - conjugated PMOs completely protected mice against lethal challenge with EBOV [ 64 , 78 ]	1
16631	Mice treated with 200 - μg doses of a ( RXR ) 4 XB - conjugated PPMO given pre - and postinfection survived @DISEASE$ [ 77 ]	1
16632	The authors found that over the 28 - day period of monitoring , VEEV was undetectable in PPMO - treated mice brain , blood and peripheral tissues .	1
16633	The antioxidant effect of test substances can be evaluated by monitoring the conjugated diene formation at the early stage of lipid peroxidation	1
16634	The hydroperoxides formed from methyl linoleate by oxidation at 40 ºC was measured by [ 43 ] over time , spectrophotometrically , at a wavelength of 234 nm ( for conjugated diene absorption )	1
16635	The oils of Thymus vulgaris L	1
16636	( thyme ) , [ Eugenia caryophyllus ( C	1
16637	Spreng ) Bull et Hare ] ( clove ) , and Ocimum basilicum L	1
16638	( basil ) had appreciable antioxidant activities , comparable to that of α - tocopherol , the reference chosen by the authors [ 43 ]	1
16639	In the thyme oil p - cymene and thymol predominated ; in the clove oil , eugenol and β - caryophyllene dominated ; and in basil oil , linalool , isoanethole and eugenol constituted the major components	1
16640	All of these components present in different relative percentages in the oils had similar ability for preventing lipidic peroxidation .	1
16641	For each cat , PBMCs were resuspended in supplemented RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I ( Gibco ® , Invitrogen ) at a concentration of 10 6 cells / mL in 6 - well plates and stimulated immediately after isolation with 4 μg / mL ODN 2216 , 4 μg / mL ODN 2243 or an equivalent volume of endotoxin - free PBS	1
16642	After 24 h incubation , supernatants were harvested by centrifugation of the cultures twice at 2000 × g for 10 min , aliquoted and stored at − 20 ° C	1
16643	Large supernatant quantities were produced with PBMCs purified after one blood collection , enabling the utilization of the same supernatants for virus inhibition experiments concerning VSV , FCV , FCoV , FHV and FPV	1
16644	New supernatant batches were produced for use in FeLV inhibition assays	1
16645	Supernatants derived from PBMCs stimulated with ODN 2216 , ODN 2243 and endotoxin - free PBS are referred to as @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the text and in the figures .	1
16646	This method measures the malondialdehyde ( MDA ) formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition ( secondary products of oxidation ) , which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid ( TBA )	1
16647	This coloured complex , which absorbs at 532 nm , results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment	1
16648	This method is not very specific , because 4 - hydroxyalkenals , 2 , 4 - alkadienals and 2 - alkenals , protein and sugar degradation products , amino acids , nucleic acids and anthocyanins are also able to react with TBA , forming a @GENE$ [ 5 ] .	1

16668	Three alternative exposure control scenarios were evaluated using the mass - balance enhanced burden of disease model to evaluate their efficiency to reduce @DISEASE$	1
16669	The exposure control scenarios start from optimizing the ventilation rates only	1

16672	The Kathmandu Valley is situated at an altitude of 1 , 300 to 1 , 350 meters above sea level and has a sub - tropical , temperate climate	1
16673	There are four distinct seasons ; premonsoon / spring ( March to May ) , monsoon / summer ( June to September ) , post - monsoon / autumn ( October to November ) and winter ( December to February ) [ 18 ]	1

16675	@GENE$ was crystallized as previously described 35	1
16676	Briefly , @GENE$ at 10 mg / mL concentration in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7	1
16677	2 and 200 mM NaCl was crystallized by itself and then amino acid was soaked into the @GENE$ crystal	1
16678	Crystallization of @GENE$ was set up with 1 µL protein solution and 1 µL well solution containing 18 % PEG3350 , 200 mM Li 2 SO4 , and 100 mM HEPES pH7	1

16687	The structures of @GENE$ complexed different amino acids were determined by directly refining the model of the unliganded @GENE$ ( PDB 4FKE ) against the amino acid - soaked crystal data	1
16688	Programs CNS 37 and CCP4 refmac 38 were used for structure refinement	1
16689	Program COOT was used for model building and structural superposition 39 .	1
16690	Understanding substrate specificity is essential to the design of molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of @GENE$	1
16691	Although the preference of @GENE$ for neutral amino acid residues at the @GENE$ has been generally established , little is known about the physical basis for this preference and even less is known about the downstream prime - side specificity of @GENE$	1
16692	In this study , we performed a comprehensive evaluation of @GENE$ substrate specificity and identified key structural features that dictate the specificity of the @GENE$	1
16693	Using an unbiased mass spectrometry - based peptide library assay , we determined the @GENE$ ′ substrate preferences of @GENE$ and prioritized candidate peptide substrates in the library for rational inhibitor design	1
16694	Six crystal structures of @GENE$ complexed with different amino acids in the @GENE$ were solved and provided a structural basis for the @GENE$ substrate specificity	1
16695	From these crystal structures , a peptide was modelled into the specificity pocket to highlight key interactions responsible for dictating the extended prime - side substrate specificity	1
16696	Using a substrate derived from the peptide library , we developed a novel substrate - based cyclic peptide inhibitor that was specific for @GENE$	1
16697	Our inhibitor specifically bound to APN - expressing @DISEASE$ cell lines in vitro , decreasing their clonogenic survival , and was an effective therapeutic , leading to decreased @DISEASE$ growth in vivo in xenograft models of @DISEASE$ .	1
16698	Spray dried plasma ( SDP ) is a protein rich product obtained from the industrial fractionation of blood from healthy animals [ 106 ]	1
16699	It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance , and protects pigs against @DISEASE$ infection by reducing the intestinal expression of @GENE$ such as @GENE$ and @GENE$ and maintaining mucosal integrity , and enhancing specific antibody defense [ 111 ]	1
16700	Spray dried plasma ( SDPP ) of porcine origin has been pinpointed as a potential source for the coronavirus in a recent epidemic of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 136 ]	1
16701	Thus , spray - dried chicken plasma ( SDCP ) has been evaluated as a replacement for SDPP in weaned pigs	1
16702	Indeed , the effect of SDCP on serum biochemistry , intestinal barrier function , immune parameters , and the expression of intestinal@GENE$  was similar to SDPP [ 137 ]	1
16703	Nevertheless , a study has provided evidence that @DISEASE$ virus is inactivated during the SDPP production process [ 138 ] .	1
16704	Organic acids Decreased pH in the stomach Exact modes of action still unknown [ 108 ] Improved growth performance Anti microbial activities is different between acids Reduced PWD Prebiotics , probiotics and synbiotics Improved intestinal health Sometimes contradictory studies on their effectiveness [ 127 , 130 ] Improved growth performance Lack of information on the potential synergism between pre - and probiotics Reduced @GENE$ attachment to the ileal mucosa	1
16705	We next compared the inhibitory effect of these two chimeras and the @GENE$ on @GENE$ expression using the @GENE$ reporter assay	1
16706	Our previous study showed that the @GENE$ - antagonizing activity of the @GENE$ is mediated by its @GENE$ , but the @GENE$ has no effect	1
16707	32 When we swapped the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ with that of the @GENE$ in the @GENE$ , a similar suppressive effect on @GENE$ activity was observed ( Figure 5C ; bar 4 compared with bar 3 ) , consistent with our previous results	1
16708	32 Likewise , when we swapped the @GENE$ of @GENE$ with that of @GENE$ in MN , the @GENE$ was capable of suppressing @GENE$ activity to comparable level ( Figure 5C ; bar 8 compared with bar 7 )	1
16709	Given that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ possesses no suppressive effect , 32 the inhibitory activity of the @GENE$ would be predominantly due to the @GENE$ of @GENE$	1
16710	A biochemical assay also confirmed that the @GENE$ maintained the ability to interact with the @GENE$ in a co - immunoprecipitation experiment ( Figure 5D ; lane 2 compared with lane 1 )	1
16711	Therefore , we concluded that the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ are required and sufficient for its innate immunosuppressive activity .	1
16712	@DISEASE$ viruses ( AIV ) of the H5 , H7 and H9 subtypes represent an enormous commercial burden for the poultry sector , at a global level	1
16713	Commercial , as well as political and sanitary issues related to the circulation of AIV , prompted policymakers and intergovernmental health organizations to set subtype and pathotype - specific international standards to better control H5 and H7 outbreaks , as these subtypes might cause epidemics of huge proportions , in different poultry species [ 1 ]	1
16714	On the other hand , AIV of the H9N2 subtype are not subject to specific international control measures , as they are considered of low - pathogenicity for poultry and their subtype has never mutated to the highly pathogenic form .	1
16715	The ENC is used to measure the degree of departure from the equal use of @GENE$ of coding regions of polioviruses	1
16716	The values of the effective number of codon ( ENC ) range from 20 to 61	1
16717	In an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid , this value would be 20 ; if all codons are used equally , it would be 61 ; and if the value of ENC is greater than 40 , the codon usage bias was regarded as low	1
16718	The values of ENC were obtained by EMBOSS CHIPS program [ 20 ] .	1
16719	A seasonal pattern of @DISEASE$ was identified in Australia and New Zealand , with an annual peak in case numbers from December to May	1
16720	This pattern may reflect waning maternal immunity lagging two to three months behind the peak kitten births	1
16721	Similar seasonality of @DISEASE$ outbreaks was reported in the Northern Hemisphere , where seasons are inverted ; case numbers peaked from July to December and were correlated with an influx of kittens born annually in spring and waning of maternal immunity over the subsequent two to three months [ 43 ] .	1
16722	In this study , we focused on the characterization of the @GENE$ in IFN antagonism	1
16723	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ localized predominantly to the @GENE$ and is required for virion assembly	1
16724	[ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] @GENE$ is of particular interest because @GENE$ also inhibits @GENE$ production through a mechanism by which the formation of @GENE$ · TBK1 / IKK - ε complex is impeded to ablate the activation of @GENE$	1
16725	30 In contrast , @GENE$ encoded by human coronavirus HKU1 associated with common cold has no influence on @GENE$ production	1
16726	32 Here we reported that the @GENE$ also specifically inhibited @GENE$ activation but not @GENE$ signaling	1
16727	@GENE$ was capable of interacting with @GENE$ and hampered TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction leading to diminished @GENE$ activation	1
16728	Using a @GENE$ containing the @GENE$ and a @GENE$ , we confirmed that the @GENE$ of @GENE$ sufficiently account for its inhibitory effect	1
16729	Although another chimera containing @GENE$ and a @GENE$ was fully competent in IFN antagonism , a truncation mutant lacking the functional first @GENE$ of SARS - CoV M was not , suggesting that the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ is largely dispensable for its immunosuppressive activity .	1
16730	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a severe @DISEASE$ caused by a novel beta coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]	1
16731	The symptoms of @DISEASE$ include @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ; it can also cause death in severe cases [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] .	1
16732	The sensitivity of the @GENE$ reaction was assessed in two ways : copy number detection and background in which 10 copies of the target could be detected	1
16733	Copy number detection was measured by serial dilutions of known amounts of DNA containing the target sequences , either as @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( Figure 3 )	1
16734	Reactions fail in both assays at DNA molecule number of less than 1 which is consistent with the stochastic probability of a target being present [ 7 ] .	1
16735	Conclusions	1
16736	Infections are the main trigger of @DISEASE$ in children of any age , followed by @DISEASE$ in the school - aged children	1

16743	Sugar water ( 40 % mass fraction of sugar ) supply ad libitum was maintained	1
16744	Then , ten adult workers were randomly sampled from each colony over four consecutive weeks until the end of the experiment ( week [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and stored at − 80 • C until further processing	1
16745	The different feeding regimes were chosen to see if there is an impact of feeding duration on virus uptake and the time gap since the last feeding of the virus until the first sampling should reduce the risk of detecting @DISEASE$ in the ant ' s gut content [ 55 , 56 ]	1
16746	Some colonies were not large enough to provide adults , thereby decreasing sample size at the last sampling ( C - N = 1 ; T1 - N = 5 ; T2 - N = 6 ) .	1

16752	Background : @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is associated with high mortality rates	1
16753	@DISEASE$ patients suffer from severe @DISEASE$ , and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) therapy may be necessary to ensure oxygenation	1
16754	@DISEASE$ has various etiologies , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or infections of various origins , and the associated immunological responses may vary	1

16757	Virus specific @GENE$ acid detection was performed using a multiplex kit from Beckman Coulter ( Miami , USA ) as described in detail 2	1
16758	This panel covered 11 different serotypes of @DISEASE$ and 11 viral serotypes among 6 viruses suspected to cause common @DISEASE$ ( Supplementary Table S2 )	1
16759	Target specific cDNA was synthe@GENE$  transcriptase primer pl@GENE$ start kit ( Beck@GENE$ r )	1
16760	Reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 12µL of extracted nucleic acid , 4µL of GeXP 5X RT buffer , 2µL of RT primer plex and 1µL each of @GENE$  r and reverse transcripta@GENE$ e	1
16761	@GENE$  48 o C for 1 minute followed by 42 o C for 60 minutes and terminated at 95 o C for 5 minutes ; the synthesised cDNA was kept at 4 o C before u@GENE$ for PCR analysis	1
16762	PCR reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 9	1
16763	3µL of synthesized cDNA , 4µL 5X PCR buffer , 4µL @GENE$ M MgCl 2 , 2µL PCR primer plex and 0	1
16764	7µL of @GENE$  polymerase ( T@GENE$ rton , CA , USA )	1
16765	The PCR reaction was initiated at 95 o C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds , 55 o C for 30 seconds and 70 o C for 1 minute	1
16766	The PCR product was maintained at 4@GENE$ o fragment analysis .	1
16767	Stakeholders differed on their take as to what contributes more to @DISEASE$ and ultimately which policy may help in reducing it	1
16768	Physicians reported being aware of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship policies and infection prevention measures to control @DISEASE$ , but were unsure if these programs alone could alleviate @DISEASE$ since they believed that @DISEASE$ could also be generated by antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters	1
16769	On the contrary , animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance since the volume of antimicrobial used over the lifespan of livestock was very low	1

16772	The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " ) by country	1
16773	Raw data provided in Table S4 .	1
16774	Afghanistan	1
16775	@DISEASE$ is the most common @DISEASE$ in childhood	1
16776	In Italy , it has been estimated that up to 9	1
16777	5 % of children aged 6 - 7 years and 10	1
16778	4 % of teenagers aged 13 - 14 years have ever been affected by this condition [ 1 ]	1
16779	@DISEASE$ exacerbations are one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency Department ( ED ) and for hospitalization in the pediatric age	1
16780	In the United States , among @DISEASE$ children nearly 60 % have one or more acute exacerbations each year [ 2 , 3 ] , and up to 20 % require ED visits annually [ 4 ]	1
16781	Moreover , @DISEASE$ patients treated in the ED are at higher risk for future exacerbations and any single severe acute episode may progress to life - threatening @DISEASE$ [ 2 , 5 ] .	1
16782	Note that the limit , lim t → ∞ F ( t ) = AR	1
16783	Based on a statistical analysis of an @DISEASE$ outbreak that occurred in Sverdlovsk , Russia , Brookmeyer , et al	1

16790	Buckeridge , et al	1
16791	[ 16 ] propose log normal models for the duration of the prodromal and fulminant stages , based on the 2001 @DISEASE$ attack in the United States	1
16792	The median duration of the prodromal stage was 12	1
16793	18 days , with a dispersion of 1	1
16794	41 , and the median duration of the fulminant stage was 1	1
16795	5 days with a dispersion again of 1	1
16796	41 .	1
16797	Examining the progression of the quantiles over time allows us to explore the center and tails of the extra radiograph count distribution	1
16798	The counts increase rapidly in the first week , then stay fairly constant ( except for the spikes ) , for a week and then slowly drop to zero after the second week	1
16799	The small spikes are due to the different probabilities of entry in the prodromal stage	1
16800	Although the shapes at each quantile are similar , the magnitude and duration of the extra radiographs counts differ	1
16801	The counts drop to zero at different time points for the different quantiles	1
16802	They drop to zero after 3 weeks for the 0	1
16803	025 quantile , after 4 weeks for the 0	1
16804	5 quantile , and after 7 weeks for the 0	1
16805	975 quantile	1
16806	These patterns in the observed time - varying distribution of the outbreak signature are a strong motivation to not use deterministic outbreak patterns , as used by some authors , since deterministic outbreak patterns do not give a realistic assessment of detection methods .	1
16807	These studies indicate that waning antibody levels and suppression of innate immune response due to stress might be some of the factors leading to an increase in viral levels in persistently infected bats ( Figure 2 ) .	1
16808	In the case of the first type of input ( FASTA file ) , the @GENE$ will perform de novo annotation , i	1
16809	e	1
16810	, will start by calling @GENE$ , and then will proceed to functional annotation , subsystems assignment , and subsequent metabolic reconstruction	1
16811	In the second case ( GenBank - formatted files ) , gene calling is optional , since GenBank - formatted files already include the coordinates for @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
16812	In the last case ( Entrez ID or @GENE$ ID ) , the tools provided within the @GENE$ Submission / Retrieval Server will query @GENE$ using the query ID ( s ) and will retrieve the sequence ( whether that sequence consists of one or a set of contigs that make up the genome project ) ; that sequence then becomes the input to the @GENE$ Server .	1
16813	The @GENE$ provides the ability to graphically display the @GENE$ around a set of @GENE$ ( normally from distinct genomes ) ; for example , see http : / / seed - viewer	1

16820	The @GENE$ also offers an alternative for creating custom interfaces , moreover , one that does not require the user to know appropriate @GENE$	1
16821	This approach exploits the conversion capabilities of the @GENE$ for creating a program to accept arbitrary protein IDs	1
16822	It also exploits the ability of @GENE$ to map functional roles into subsystems as described in the preceding example	1
16823	The result is a tool that enables the user to take a @GENE$ ID and a region size , and extract the genes that are found within a region centered on the designated gene	1
16824	The code for this example is shown at	1

16830	While a web interface is available for visualizing the data within the @GENE$ ( http : / / pubseed	1
16831	theseed	1
16832	org ) , this interface is inadequate to make full effective use of the massive quantities of data now embodied within the @GENE$	1
16833	To truly expose the @GENE$ data for efficient large - scale use by the global scientific community , we initially developed a Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) server to allow the needed programmatic access to the @GENE$ data [ 21 ] ; however , the SOAP server could not scale up with the increased volume of data	1
16834	To cope with the increasing demands placed on the @GENE$ web services , as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the @GENE$ resources , we developed a secondgeneration of web services to improve throughput , response time , and access to @GENE$ functionality	1
16835	Here , we describe in detail the four primary servers now available for remotely accessing @GENE$ data and we describe the client - side distribution of server scripts that we provide as examples of how the servers may be applied to perform complex analyses of genome data .	1

16837	To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report to describe BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed @DISEASE$	1
16838	A search of the PubMed / MEDLINE database using the key terms " Bacillus Calmette - Guérin " , " Bacille Calmette - Guérin " , " BCG " and " @DISEASE$ " revealed no reports of similar cases in the published literature	1
16839	Although the detection of BCG inoculation site @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ did prompt a thorough investigation for @DISEASE$ in our patient , diagnostic criteria for the disease was not met	1
16840	All clinical and laboratory findings were however consistent with the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , and a complete and rapid recovery ensued with supportive therapy .	1
16841	Supplementary Figures	1
16842	To produce adult mice that express an @GENE$ , we bred CN2 - 29 transgenic mice , which carry an @GENE$ , [ 5 , 6 , 9 ] with Mx1 - Cre transgenic mice [ 10 ] , which express @GENE$ recombinase in response to @GENE$ or a chemical inducer of @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( Figure 1A )	1
16843	Following @GENE$ injection , the @GENE$ was rearranged , and @GENE$ were expressed in the livers of F1 progeny ( CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice ) within 7 days after @GENE$ injection ( Figure 1B ) .	1
16844	Nurse ( N4 ) indicated that : " The major problem that we have is that ( emotional ) our hospital is a rural - based and most patients are from the poor backgrounds ; so , they always default their treatment for various reasons , such ; continue to receive @DISEASE$ grant , bad side effects of medication , social problems and long distances to the clinics where they should collect their medications ; lack of money to buy food since @DISEASE$ drugs make them eat more	1

16847	Hantavirus Immunology of Rodent Reservoirs : Current Status and Future Directions	1
16848	Our previous work demonstrating that CVB3 was sensitive to polyamine depletion via DFMO suggested a role for polyamines in virus replication [ 25 ]	1
16849	To ascertain how CVB3 evolves in response to repeated replication cycles in the absence of polyamine depletion , we passaged the virus in the presence of DFMO	1
16850	We treated Vero - E6 cells with 500 µM DFMO or left controls untreated ( NT ) , for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0	1
16851	1 plaque forming units ( pfu ) / mL	1
16852	After 24 h , we collected cellular supernatant and passaged 1 / 10th of the volume onto naïve cells	1
16853	Viral titers were determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five , the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO , from 10 µM to 5 mM , and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection	1
16854	We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible , with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70	1
16855	9 µM	1
16856	In contrast , virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment , with an IC50 value of 293 µM , suggesting developing resistance to DFMO .	1
16857	Recently , Cabrera and Prieto ( 2010 ) [ 153 ] were able , for the first time , to show the application of artificial neural networks ( ANN ) on the prediction of the antioxidant activity of essential oils in two experimental in vitro models : in the DPPH and linoleic acid models	1
16858	They used about 30 components from 80 that are described as possessing antioxidant activity and the results confirmed that this computational technique was reliable for predicting the antioxidant activity of essential oils from some of its components	1
16859	Some of them are also reported in the present work ( thymol , carvacrol , eugenol , pcymene ) among others	1
16860	Nevertheless , the authors only tested two models	1
16861	There are much more , those that allow evaluating the ability for scavenging ROS or RNS or chelating metals	1
16862	In this way , the work is not finished and much more needs to be done .	1
16863	Two NHPs , the common marmoset and rhesus macaque model were established for @DISEASE$ by three different research groups [ 49 , [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ]	1
16864	The clinical symptoms included @DISEASE$ which was mild in nature and could be diagnosed with radio imaging and computed tomography [ 54 , 56 , 59 ] and @DISEASE$ of severe nature showing fatal clinical symptoms requiring euthanasia [ 54 , 59 ]	1
16865	Exposure to the MERS - 0 infectious clone ( icMERS - 0 ) strain in Rhesus monkeys is reported to cause @DISEASE$ , wherein virus antigen has been detected	1
16866	@DISEAS@GENE$ es was found to be transient and mild in nature , which resolved by 30 days from infection	1
16867	@DISEASE$ was also found to be mild upon @DISEASE$ in NHPs	1
16868	Earlier studies found ocular , intratracheal or intranasal exposure of MERS - EMC isolate to cause lethal disease	1
16869	However , it has been argued that lethality was due to manipulations of marmoset , which have higher sensitivity than macaque species [ 54 , 57 ]	1
16870	Cases of mild to moderate symptoms even after higher viral titer have also been reported in other studies [ 56 ]	1
16871	Small animals , such as hamsters and mice , have been found to be resistant to @DISEASE$ and development of models of severe @DISEASE$ has been a challenge [ 60 ] .	1
16872	A new look at an old virus : patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918	1
16873	The diagnostic procedure in cats positive to @DISEASE$ should always be completed with @DISEASE$ can infect apparently healthy cats , and as with dogs , infection may persist with no clinical manifestations [ 88 ]	1
16874	Since cats infected with L	1
16875	infantum may not be sick and , therefore , not present any clinical signs , it is questionable whether healthy cats should be tested for this infection	1
16876	In our opinion , cats with no clinical signs and / or @DISEASE$ compatible with @DISEASE$ should be tested for @DISEASE$ if they are used as blood donors , since it has been shown for humans and dogs that blood products from infected individuals may transmit infection [ 89 ]	1
16877	Antibody testing and blood PCR are advisable as indicated for dogs	1
16878	Furthermore , testing can be done for exportation purposes to countries where @DISEASE$ is not endemic and may require cats to be tested for infection before importation	1
16879	Finally , cats with clinical conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapies should be preliminarily tested in endemic areas , as clinical cases of @DISEASE$ were diagnosed in cats under long term immunosuppressive treatment .	1
16880	Although the data on FeL supported by consolidated evidence - based studies are limited , these guidelines constitute a baseline for educating and informing feline practitioners with the most comprehensive and updated data set on this important neglected feline @DISEASE$ .	1
16881	Cruz - Rivera et al	1
16882	[ 25 ] showed that in cultured cells of black flying foxes , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) were expressed at higher levels than their human counterparts	1
16883	They also demonstrated that an antiviral effector @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a unique @GENE$ , which is stimulated directly by @GENE$ in bat cells [ 25 ]	1
16884	The activated @GENE$ can then cleave @GENE$	1
16885	In contrast , in human cells , @GENE$ is not directly stimulated by @GENE$ but via an intermediate molecule , @GENE$ [ 26 ]	1
16886	Similarly , direct activation of @GENE$ was also observed in in vivo experiments with Jamaican fruit bats ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) [ 27 ]	1
16887	Inactivation of the @GENE$ renders bat cells more susceptible to virus infection and direct induction of @GENE$ may provide bats with an additional layer of antiviral defense [ 25 ] .	1

16895	The microplate was quantified using a microplate reader ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA )	1
16896	Target protein expression was normalized to the @GENE$ expression .	1
16897	Of the 21 @GENE$ in our @GENE$ , @GENE$ binding sites were detected within 10 kb of seven @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) in the He et al	1
16898	data set , two @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) in the Dupays et al	1
16899	data set , and three @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) in both data sets ( Dupays et al	1
16900	2015 ; He et al	1
16901	2011 ) ( Table 4 )	1
16902	Collectively , this indicates that at least 50 % of the genes in the @GENE$ are bound by @GENE$ in heart tissue at some point during development	1
16903	We also examined @GENE$ enrichment at our candidate @GENE$ on @GENE$ and @GENE$ and found @GENE$ enrichment at @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ in the He et al	1
16904	data set	1
16905	Although tissue - specific regulatory mechanisms may differ between the heart and the pulmonary myocardium , this is strong evidence to support the theory that @GENE$ could directly regulate expression of the @GENE$ .	1
16906	Modulates the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ to regulate power output ( Sequeira et al	1
16907	2015 In sum , the identity of the @GENE$ themselves , and their distinct expression compared to @GENE$ , strongly supports that we have identified a network of @GENE$ expressed in the pulmonary myocardium .	1
16908	Besides the expected self - limiting mild @DISEASE$ observed in each of the challenged birds , the H9N2 virus spread beyond the respiratory and digestive tracts and , in the absence of @DISEASE$ , robustly replicated in the oviduct of 62 % of the hens Figure 5 Representative histological pictures of the infundibulum , magnum and uterus before , during and after the infection	1
16909	A - I All pictures were taken using a 10 × objective from 4 - μm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin	1
16910	B During the acute phase of infection ( 4 - 10 days pi ) , replication of the virus in the infundibulum was associated with the occurrence of severe @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in the mucosa of the organ	1
16911	C In the chronic phase of the disease ( 70 - 80 days pi ) , birds with @DISEASE$ showed a profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture due to the presence of @DISEASE$ ( asterisk ) , hyperplastic lymphocytic aggregates ( arrows ) and @DISEASE$ of the mucosa	1
16912	E , H @DISEASE$ were rarely observed during the acute phase of the infection and were limited to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( arrow heads ) , respectively	1
16913	F , I A full restoration of the tissue integrity was observed for the magnum and uterus in all subjects , after 70 - 80 days from infection .	1
16914	The observed acute and chronic drops in egg production correlate with reports in the literature , in which acute declines range from 30 to 80 % and chronic ones , although less frequently described , range from 10 to 25 % [ 4 , 18 , [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]	1
16915	In particular , in Morocco and in the Middle East , @DISEASE$ infections have been associated with chronic declines up to 11 - 14 weeks after the beginning of the outbreaks [ 4 , 17 ] .	1
16916	We hypothesized that the reduction in the levels of @GENE$ in rVV - HCV - treated mice was not caused by cytolytic elimination of hepatocytes that expressed @GENE$	1
16917	To investigate this hypothesis , we conducted an RTD - PCR analysis of @GENE$ from liver samples of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice	1
16918	The @GENE$ was similar in rVV - N25 - treated and control mice 28 days after immunization ( Figure 3D )	1
16919	We also measured the expression of @GENE$ in LC16m8 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice with that in rVV - N25 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 28 days after immunization ; the @GENE$ levels did not differ between rVV - N25 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) and control mice ( Figure 3E )	1
16920	These results indicated that rVV - @GENE$ - induced suppression of @GENE$ expression could be controlled at a posttranscriptional level .	1
16921	Suanarunsawat et al	1
16922	( 2010 ) [ 58 ] have investigated the anti - hyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of essential oils extracted from Ocimum sanctum L	1
16923	leaves in rats fed with high cholesterol diet	1
16924	Eugenol and methyl eugenol were the most important components in the essential oils	1
16925	The oils were able to decrease the high levels of TBARS either in cardiac or liver tissues , protecting them against stress induced oxidation .	1
16926	To further establish this , Hsu cells were transfected with @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ with or without transfection with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
16927	As a control cells were transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
16928	Cell lysates were collected 48 hours post - transfection	1
16929	Western blot was performed using @GENE$	1
16930	The results showed decreased @GENE$ levels in cells transfected with @GENE$ or WNV - NS5 ( Fig 5D )	1
16931	The levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
16932	In WNV - NS3 transfected cells , there was no significant change in @GENE$ level	1
16933	These results indicate that WNV infection of Culex cells leads to degradation of @GENE$ via @GENE$ , activated by WNV NS1 and @GENE$ .	1
16934	Not always the best activity found in the TBARS assay also corresponds to the best ability to scavenge DPPH radicals	1
16935	Such was found [ 44 , 51 ]	1
16936	The essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko presented better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals	1
16937	Ageratum conyzoides methanolic extracts that had low capacity for preventing lipid oxidation , in the DPPH assay were revealed to be more effective than the essential oil [ 51 ]	1
16938	On the other hand Lindera pulcherrima , Dodecadenia grandiflora and Dodecadenia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method as well as in the β - carotene bleaching test , but in the DPPH method , only Dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger [ 44 ]	1
16939	Another example was that reported [ 52 ] for Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus oils	1
16940	In this assay , the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation , whereas in the DPPH method , the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals , even better than the standards ascorbic acid and BHT	1
16941	The same authors also used the Rancimat test , and in that ase , the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare , although worse than that of the reference BHT	1
16942	The non - polar fraction and essential oil of Hymenocrater longiflorus possessed great ability to inhibit the bleaching of β - carotene , nevertheless the results differed when the DPPH method was used	1
16943	In this case , the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging these free radicals [ 47 ]	1
16944	Independent of the plant part of Myrtus communis var	1
16945	italica L	1
16946	used and the antioxidant method used , the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils [ 46 ]	1
16947	This is one example in which in both methods the results maintained in contrast to those reported until now .	1
16948	Plaque assays were performed as previously described [ 7 ]	1
16949	In brief , supernatant media from cells infected with @DISEASE$ ( 10 - fold dilutions ) were added onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 6 - well plates	1
16950	After 1 h incubation at 37 ° C , the cells were overlaid with medium containing agar	1
16951	Plaques formed within 72 hpi were counted and the results were plotted graphically	1
16952	The experiments were conducted at least twice , each with duplicates .	1
16953	In 2009 , the number of @DISEASE$ foxes in Humboldt County infected with the CA skunk variant increased 356 % from an average of 1 - 2 per year in the preceding 15 years to 7 in the latter months of 2008 to 38 in 2009 ( Annual Reports from California Department of Public Health , Veterinary Public Health Section )	1
16954	In 2009 , only 2 skunks were reported @DISEASE$ in Humboldt County suggesting that @DISEASE$ infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox - to - fox transmission	1
16955	The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested ( S	1
16956	Chandler , USDA , personal communication )	1
16957	This epizootic of @DISEASE$ in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region , but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by @DISEASE$ animals on humans and their pets [ 12 ] .	1

16965	1 mJ / cm 2 ( 95 % CI : 1	1
16966	0 - 1	1
16967	2 ) for H1N1 virus	1
16968	Thus as we 13 , 15 and others [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] reported in earlier studies for bacterial inactivation , 222 - nm far - UVC light and 254 - nm broad - spectrum germicidal light are also comparable in their efficiencies for aerosolized viral inactivation	1
16969	Other recent work comparing viral inactivation across the UVC spectrum has shown variations in efficiency are expected , but in general both regions of the spectrum are effective in inactivation , though the precise cause of inactivation may differ 20 , 21	1
16970	However as discussed above , based on biophysical considerations and in contrast to the known human health safety issues associated with conventional germicidal 254 - nm broad - spectrum UVC light , far - UVC light does not appear to be cytotoxic to exposed human cells and tissues in vitro or in vivo [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .	1
16971	A tool for controllable annotation - based conversion of @GENE$ into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service , fostering links between quality of sequence annotation , and efficiency of communication and knowledge dissemination among researchers .	1
16972	Normal bronchial epithelial cells were plated at the indicated densities ( 2 × 10 3 cells / well ) in 96 - well multiwell culture plates ( Costar )	1
16973	Cells were treated with inhibitor or antagonist for 2 h before exposure of the cells to PGE 2 in the culture medium ( containing 10 % FBS )	1
16974	In separate experiments , cells were transfected with control , @GENE$ or @GENE$ for 40 h before exposure to PGE 2 for up to 4 days	1
16975	Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter - Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay , a homogenous method of determining number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present which signals the presence of metabolically active cells .	1
16976	According to the transmission mechanism of @DISEASE$ , the diffusion and dispersion of the aerosols expelled by respiratory activities are important and necessary for infection risk assessment [ 18 ]	1
16977	The airborne transmission of these aerosols in an airplane The removal of contaminants was not obviously affected by the moving speed Choi and Edwards [ 15 ] CFD a realistic walking human model a Room - Room and a Room - Hall configuration particle The rate of mass transport increases as the walking speed increases , but the total amount of material transported is more influenced by the initial proximity of the human from the doorway .	1
16978	The selection of animals genetically resistant to ETEC F4 and / or F18 is considered as a radical solution to eliminate the @DISEASE$ in a swine herd	1
16979	However , progress in this area is very limited or even non - existent	1
16980	Pigs that are resistant to ETEC : F4 and / or F18 do not ex@GENE$ ptors for these fimbrial types [ 2 ]	1
16981	The expression of these receptors is genetically determined and inherited in a dominant way and the loci contro@GENE$ g F4@GENE$  F18R expression are located on separate chromosomes	1
16982	The gene underlying resistance to F4ab / ac ETEC has been assign@GENE$ me 13 , wherea@GENE$ eptor is located on another chromosome that was not identified [ 102 ]	1
16983	A PCR - RFLP test has been developed to allow genotyping for F4ab / ac ETEC resistance / susceptibility [ 103 ]	1
16984	Three different genotypes were observed and were identified as resistant ( RR ) , susceptible heterozygote ( SR ) and susceptible homozygote ( SS )	1
16985	However , it cannot be predicted if additional typ@GENE$ briae or new variants of known types will emerge which could bind to yet unidentified receptors and could cause outbreaks of @DISEASE$ and mortality in the nursery [ 2 ]	1
16986	It is difficult to understand the reasons behind the non - exploration of the genetic breeding for ETEC resistant pigs to reduce economic losses associated with @DISEASE$ and to reduce the use of antimicrobials on farms	1
16987	It was shown in an early study that F4 susceptible piglets tend to have better growth performance then F4 resistant ones [ 104 ]	1
16988	Also , heterozygous F4R − piglets are not passively protected from infection by ETEC : F4 strains [ 105 ] .	1
16989	The global demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach 16 , 500 tons by the year 2021 , this being one of the least expensive classes of antimicrobials available in veterinary medicine in some countries [ 17 ]	1
16990	Thus , the pricing structure makes colistin particularly attractive for use in pig production	1
16991	Since the inception of its clinical use in 1960 , colistin has been used in pig production in many countries for the treatment and prevention of @DISEASE$ caused by Enterobacteriaceae , and even sometimes for growth promotion over long periods , to improve growth rate and feed conversion efficiency in pigs [ 18 , 69 , 70 ]	1
16992	In certain countries such as Canada , where colistin has not been approved for use in pigs , a rapid increase in resistance of ETEC to a wide range of antimicrobials has prompted the use of colistin in weaned pigs under the veterinarian ' s responsibility [ 71 ]	1
16993	However , current data on the total quantities of colistin used in pigs worldwide have been difficult to obtain accurately [ 70 ]	1
16994	Some data , for example in Denmark , indicate that the use of colistin for the treatment of sows increased between 2002 and 2008 [ 72 ]	1
16995	Of the two forms of colistin commercially available , colistin sulfate ( CS ) and colistin methanesulphonate sodium ( CMS ) , and only CS is approved in pig production in some countries [ 18 ]	1
16996	Usually it is administered orally in the drinking water at the dose of 50 , 000 IU / kg body weight every 12 h for 3 or 5 days [ 25 ]	1
16997	Colistin is mostly used in monotherapy in pigs , although it may be combined with other antimicrobials , such as amoxicillin , for the treatment of @DISEASE$ [ 25 , 73 ] .	1
16998	To differentiate rare variants from sequencing errors , methodologies were developed to measure and control for sequencing and PCR errors and described in Fig	1
16999	S1 legend [ 17 , 18 ]	1
17000	Briefly , all @GENE$ in the @GENE$ were identified as sequencing errors and removed from analysis	1
17001	Erroneous @GENE$ in the @GENE$ were used to estimate the overall PCR error rate [ 17 , 18 ]	1
17002	Rates of these two types of errors were then combined in a position - dependent bionomial error model to make variant calls	1
17003	The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura - Nei model	1
17004	The tree with the highest log likelihood ( - 14363	1
17005	5660 ) is shown	1
17006	The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches	1
17007	Initial tree ( s ) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows	1
17008	When the number of common sites was , 100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites , the maximum parsimony method was used ; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used	1
17009	The tree is drawn to scale , with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site	1
17010	The analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences	1
17011	All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated	1
17012	There were a total of 9669 positions in the final dataset	1
17013	Bootstrap values ( percentage from 500 replications ) are shown for the relevant nodes	1
17014	Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [ 28 ]	1

17016	Cats with @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ were recruited by a multi - center group of primary care veterinarians in the greater Cincinnati region	1
17017	Cats with at least one episode of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ per week for a minimum duration of 3 weeks , with no more than three episodes of @DISEASE$ daily were included	1
17018	The @DISEASE$ excluded those defined as hairball only but could include hair material if present in addition to food and / or bile	1
17019	Cats were at least 1 year of age , with a body condition score ( BCS ) between 2 and 4 on a 5 - point scale , and housed exclusively indoors	1
17020	Cats were excluded if they were fed a veterinary therapeutic diet ; had a known @DISEASE$ ; had a history of undesired @DISEASE$ in excess of 10 % over the last 2 months ; had received antibiotic therapy within the last month ; received long - acting immunosuppressive drugs within the past 6 weeks ; or had received any immunosuppressive drugs within 3 weeks prior to enrollment .	1

17023	Do these values relate to previous work by the authors ? The source ( s ) used should be explained and appropriate references provided .	1
17024	From all patients and controls , throat and rectal swab samples were taken on admission or at the community visit and a second set of swab samples was taken ten to fourteen days later	1
17025	As detection of potential carriage in cases and hospital controls could be affected by their antimicrobial treatment , household members were also studied for carriage of S	1
17026	suis serotype 2 since if carriage and associated transmission were to occur , household members of carriers are the most likely to become positive	1
17027	Adult household members , defined as any adult ( at least 15 years old ) who resided for at least 50 % of the week in the same house as the case or control , were identified either at the HTD , when taking care of a case or hospital control , or during the household visits	1
17028	From each household , we choose a maximum of three adult household members from whom we took throat and rectal swabs in the same way as for the cases and controls , following written informed consent	1
17029	For all cases and controls who reported exposure to pigs at home , sampling of the pigs was performed in collaboration with the Sub - department of Animal Health of Ho Chi Minh City	1
17030	Swab samples were taken from all pigs present ( except pregnant sows to avoid stress - induced miscarriage ) within 4 weeks of admission of the patient , or at the second visit to the community controls .	1
17031	Until the 1980s , FPV was the only reported viral cause of @DISEASE$ in cats	1
17032	FPV is able to infect cats by first binding t@GENE$ ep@GENE$  fTfR ) expressed on the surface of cells , followed by clathrin - mediated endocytosis to initiate infection [ 3 ]	1
17033	Canine parvovirus CPV - 2 emerged in the late 1970s and was initially unable to infect cats , as it could not bind t@GENE$  fTfR [ 3 ]	1
17034	However , infectivity for feline cells was acquired soon after by the genetic variant CPV - 2a , which emerged in 1979 and replaced CPV - 2 [ 4 ]	1
17035	The ability to infect cats has also been retained by subsequent antigenic variants of CPV - 2a , termed CPV - 2b and CPV - 2c , which only differ from CPV - 2a at a single amino acid posit@GENE$ ( VP2 426 )	1
17036	These and other antigenic variants of CPV can cause @DISEASE$ in both naturally acquired and experimental infections of cats [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] .	1
17037	Further evaluation of the cellular immunogenicity of the ZIKV - prME vaccine entailed the determination of the polyfunctional properties of CD8 + T cells collected 1 week after the final immunisation	1
17038	The results show that the ZIKV - prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine - specific T cells expressing @GENE$ ( @GENE$  α ) a@GENE$  γ	1
17039	Importantly , ZIKV - prME vaccination exhibited a strong ability to expand T cell functionality ( Figure 2d ) .	1

17075	The @GENE$ encoding the entire @GENE$ ( 413 aa ) of the @GENE$ was in silico modified by introducing silent codon alterations to remove three termination signals ( TTTTTNT ) for vaccinia virus early transcription and two G / C nucleotide runs from the original @GENE$ sequence ( Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC / 2012 , GenBank accession no	1
17076	JX869059 )	1
17077	A @GENE$ was generated by DNA synthesis ( Invitrogen Life Technology , Regensburg , Germany ) and cloned into the @GENE$ [ 45 ] to place the @GENE$ under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early / late promoter @GENE$ [ 46 ] resulting in the @GENE$ .	1
17078	Before this investigation , only one @GENE$ from Australia had been deposited in the GenBank database ( FPV 193 / 70 , GenBank accession no	1
17079	X55115 )	1
17080	The evolutionary relationships with FPV 193 / 70 cannot be inferred reliably , since the isolate , obtained from a 3 - month - old cat in Melbourne with peracute fatal @DISEASE$ , had been serially passaged in vitro before sequencing in 1990	1
17081	Interestingly , FPV 193 / 70 falls notably close to a clade of vaccine viruses in our analysis	1
17082	In addition , we generate@GENE$ uence of an FPV strain detected in a healthy feral cat from Tasmania in 2010 , which was genetically distinct from outbreak strains in this study and also fell into clade D , suggesting a vaccine - related origin	1
17083	These findings , together with a report of FPV detection in the bone marrow of a healthy feral cat from Melbourne in 2012 [ 25 ] , provide evidence that FPV has been circulating widely in Australia , at least since the 1970s , although the viruses are phylogenetically unrelated to the 2015 - 2018 outbreaks .	1

17132	As the founding organization of @GENE$ , EHA aims to serve as a " bridging actor " within the network , leveraging its connections with scientists and other stakeholders in the region and globally to link various actors and accelerate the transfer of knowledge between them , as per Kingston et al	1
17133	[ 21 ]	1
17134	By adopting the approach that " local problems require local solutions , " @GENE$ will empower local scientists to take ownership of field and laboratory research activities and help shape the overall direction of research based on locally identified priorities [ 21 , 151 ]	1
17135	The central goals of @GENE$ are to provide support to existing organizations and scientists , strengthen scientific capacity building , and bring together groups in a strategic fashion , so as to ensure maximum effectiveness and resiliency of the network	1
17136	While EHA is helping to initiate the network , ownership of the research network must ultimately be driven by the partner scientists and stakeholders from the region	1
17137	In order to achieve long - term sustainability , @GENE$ will incorporate the following elements into its design : ( 1 ) in - service training programs , ( 2 ) data sharing platforms , ( 3 ) communication and networking opportunities , and ( 4 ) local leadership	1
17138	We detail each of these elements of sustainability further below .	1
17139	It is also important to point out that to achieve an optimal balance between bat conservation and disease surveillance , it is critical that research findings are reported in a manner that avoids fear - mongering statements and promotes the ecological and economic benefits of protecting local bat populations	1
17140	If reporting is done improperly and in haste , consequences include the destruction of roosting sites or culling bat populations , which can undermine conservation efforts and can break down trust among network participants	1
17141	Similarly , accurate and timely reporting of virus surveillance in bats should be coupled with scientifically - informed intervention recommendations to reduce bat - human interactions ( e	1
17142	g	1
17143	, placing bamboo skirts over date palm sap collection pots curtailed the spread of @DISEASE$ in Bangladesh [ 153 ] )	1
17144	Successfully blending both conservation and public health messaging is difficult , but critical to preventing spillover into human populations and the subsequent retaliatory actions against bats [ 10 , 12 , 154 ] .	1
17145	Most participants asserted that one of the probable strategies to counter @DISEASE$ was to increase vaccination rates in children and adult population	1
17146	However , increasing vaccination uptake will uncover another set of issues including population awareness , behavior changes , funding for regular vaccination , workforce to administer vaccination , and availability of vaccines .	1
17147	To our knowledge , our study is the first in Europe to investigate @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ patients during the first three post - pandemic seasons after the 2009 / 10 pandemic	1
17148	The strengths of our study include the multicentre design covering the majority of PICUs in Bavaria , the active screening for @DISEASE$ in patients admitted to PICUs , and PCR - confirmation of all @DISEASE$ cases	1
17149	A limitation is that the corrected incidence estimates were based on the assumption that participating and nonparticipating PICUs treated a similar number of severe @DISEASE$ patients	1
17150	Although PICUs of both groups were of similar size , some of the non - participating PICUs , where paediatricians indicated lack of time as reason for non - participation , may have treated a higher number of patients , or patients with higher acuity	1
17151	Further limitations include potential over - and underreporting in participating PICUs	1
17152	On the one hand , due to different hospitalization rules some children may have been admitted to PICUs mainly for the purpose of monitoring their course of @DISEASE$ disease more closely , thus resulting in an overestimate of severe cases	1
17153	On the other hand , some parents of children with severe @DISEASE$ may have refused study participation , or children with a fulminant course of @DISEASE$ may have died before they were admitted to a PICU [ 4 ]	1
17154	Thus , the high incidence estimates derived in this study may still underestimate the true burden of @DISEASE$	1
17155	[ 19 ] b Key data from this study were pooled with data from Streng et al	1

17169	Therefore , in the absence of PAA the decreased level of @GENE$ in muSCH cells in comparison with that of HeLa cells is likely to be attributed to an interference of HSV - 1 transcription by the @GENE$ activity of the @GENE$ ( Figure 5B )	1
17170	With treatment of PAA , a specific inhibitor of @GENE$ , the level of viral DNA replication in muSCH and HeLa cells were shown to be almost identical at immediate early stage	1
17171	This relatively mild impact of PAA on DNA replication in muSCH cells as compared with HeLa and SCH07072 cells was also observed when selected @GENE$ were measured in these cells at immediate early stage ( Figure 5C )	1
17172	Transcriptions of these genes were found to be significantly decreased in HeLa and SCH07072 cells upon PAA , which reflects the decreased level of @GENE$ for transcription	1
17173	By contrast , transcription level of these @GENE$ in muSCH cells at the same stage did not show any significant difference between PAA treated and untreated cells .	1

17234	However , the viruses	1
17235	There were similarities and differences in the narratives about the different epidemics	1
17236	Broadly , none of the epidemics had narratives relating to all four themes of the politics of epidemics	1
17237	However , both Zika and Ebola had narratives on three of the four themes	1
17238	The SARs literature addressed only two of the four themes	1
17239	Notably , there was lack of relevant literature on the research and development theme .	1
17240	When responsibility for the origin of the epidemic is reduced to cultural and ethnic minority groups , for example , the Asian community during the @DISEASE$ epidemic , South American women living in poverty during the @DISEASE$ epidemic , and communities engaging in traditional Liberian cultural practices during the @DISEASE$ epidemic , this further marginalizes the already vulnerable populations	1
17241	It is important that emphasis is placed on the extreme vulnerability of these groups to an @DISEASE$ outbreak , rather than placing blame and ultimately exacerbating experiences of oppression .	1
17242	JEV efficiently infects primary porcine NEC	1
17243	To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side , we utilized well - differentiated @DISEASE$ cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa	1
17244	These experiments showed that both @DISEASE$ strains infected cultures from the apical side , resulting in virus replication ( Fig	1
17245	2 )	1
17246	Again , the Laos strain showed statistically significantly highe@GENE$ f viral RNA than the Nakayama strain	1
17247	Despite that , the two @DISEASE$ strains tested displayed similar replication profiles , reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig	1
17248	2A )	1
17249	To test for apical and / or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection , we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC	1
17250	The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both @DISEASE$ strains ( Fig	1
17251	2B )	1
17252	Interestingly , similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts ( Fig	1
17253	2C ) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection	1
17254	With respect to RNA levels , the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the @DISEASE$ system	1
17255	At 72 hpi , as shown in Fig	1
17256	2D , we visualized @DISEASE$ infe@GENE$ EC by labeling of virus ( E protein , green ) , nuclei ( 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride [ DAPI @GENE$ k blue ) , tight junctions ( @GENE$ lue ) , and cilia ( [UNK] - tubulin , red )	1
17257	While we observed mainly isolated E protein - positive cells for the Nakayama strain , the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein - positive cells@GENE$ D ) @GENE$ on of E protein and [UNK] - tubulin signals , suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells ( Fig	1

17259	Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 / sample for 2 h , followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h	1
17260	In panel A , nuclei were stained with DAP ( blue ) , cilia with anti - ␤ - tubulin ( red ) , and JEV with anti - E protein 4G2 ( green )	1
17261	The scale bar represents 10 m	1
17262	Three - dimensional ( 3D ) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy	1
17263	In panel B , a higher magnification of panel A is shown	1
17264	In panel C , viral RNA was quantified by real - time RT - PCR	1
17265	Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75 % interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95 % confidence intervals	1

17268	To investigate the pattern of relative synonymous codon usage ( RSCU ) without the influence of amino acid composition among all @DISEASE$ samples , the RSCU values of cod@GENE$ each ORF of polioviruses were calculated according to the formula of previous reports [ 22 , 23 ] .	1
17269	inTrODUcTiOn Viruses have long been associated with @DISEASE$ of the central nervous system ( CNS ) , such as @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , both as potential inducers and as facilitators of a selfreactive ( SR ) immune response ( 1 , 2 )	1
17270	While the detection of viral antige@GENE$ l an@GENE$  brains supports a role for viral infections in triggering @DISEASE$ ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) , the " hygiene hypothesis " rather proposes a protective function ( 6 , 7 ) , underlining the ambiguous link between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( 8 )	1
17271	This dichotomy between @DISEASE$ infections and @DISEASE$ is reflected in two prominent models of viral - induced @DISEASE$ , i	1
17272	e	1
17273	, @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and neurotropic @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
17274	During persistent @DISEASE$ infection , activation of SR T cells by epitope spreading triggers an @DISEASE$ characterized by @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( 9 , 10 )	1
17275	By contrast , despite ongoing @DISEASE$ , persistent @DISEASE$ are defined by clinical recovery with no evidence for autoimmune - mediated clinical symptoms ( 11 , 12 )	1
17276	Nevertheless , our recent study demonstrated that endogenous SR T cells are activated specifically during chronic infection , correlating with kinetics of JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus ( JHMV ) - induced @DISEASE$ ( 13 )	1
17277	However , the endogenous SR T cell response declined despite sustained myelin loss during viral persistence and the preserved ability of antigen - presenting cells from both cervical lymph nodes ( CLN ) and the CNS to activate myelin - specific CD4 + T cells ex vivo	1
17278	These findings suggested that chronic JHMV infection actively induces suppressive mechanisms to limit the development of @DISEASE$	1
17279	Immune regulation associated with @DISEASE$ requires a delicate balance between promoting effective virus clearance while limiting tissue damage	1
17280	This is especially critical within the CNS due to its limited regenerative capacity	1
17281	Following @DISEASE$ infection , T cells primarily control infectious virus within the brain and spinal cords within 2 weeks	1
17282	Nevertheless , viral persistence is evident by ongoing detection of viral RNA predominantly within spinal cords	1
17283	Demyelination is initiated during T cell - mediated control of viral replication , peaks subsequent to virus control , but continues throughout persistence ( 12 )	1
17284	Induction of Foxp3 + regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) and type 1 regulatory T ( Tr1 ) cells and their migration to the CNS are already evident during the acute infection ( 14 , 15 )	1
17285	Both regulatory populations are known to control autoimmune diseases ( 16 , 17 )	1
17286	Prior studies of their role during JHMV infection demonstrated that Tr1 cells have a limited effect on tissue damage ( 15 ) , while Foxp3 + Tregs restrict the extent of demyelination without affecting viral persistence ( 18 , 19 )	1
17287	Indeed , depletion of CD25 + regulatory CD4 + T cells prior JHMV infection correlated with increased myelin loss during viral persistence ( 19 )	1
17288	Similarly , transfer of naive Foxp3 + Tregs into acutely JHMV - infected mice improved clinical disease and restricted tissue damage without altering control of virus replication ( 20 )	1
17289	The limited role of Foxp3 + Tregs in virus clearance was also confirmed by unaltered antiviral T cell responses following Foxp3 + Treg depletion during acute infection with the less pathogenic MHV - A59 strain ( 21 )	1
17290	However , the same study showed that Foxp3 + Tregs limited proliferation of transferred SR T cells in the CLN ( 21 )	1
17291	Altogether , these data support the notion that Foxp3 + Tregs limit tissue damage by specifically counteracting the activation of endogenous SR T cells , without apparent affects on antiviral T cells	1
17292	However , in all these studies , transfer or depletion of Foxp3 + Tregs were performed during acute MHV infection , prior to the induction of endogenous SR T cells ( 13 ) , limiting knowledge of their function during persistence	1
17293	Regulation of in vivo primed SR T cells and immunopathology by endogenous Foxp3 + Treg during persistence remains unexplored .	1
17294	The moving person also has a significantly high intake dose	1
17295	When walking through the aisle during the coughing of the index patient , the moving person may receive an intake fraction of 2	1
17296	2 × 10 − 6 , which is larger than that of 80 % of the seated passengers	1
17297	Especially , for the passengers who are seated far away from the index patient , the intake fractions that they received during walking in the airplane cabin can be O ( 10 2 ) larger than that without movement	1
17298	If a seated passenger walks in the airplane and passes through the high - dose region close to the index patient , he / she may also receive a significantly high intake dose	1
17299	Frequent walking of the seated passengers may also result in a high infection risk , which may be up to 55 %	1
17300	After considering the movement behaviors of the seated passengers in the risk assessment and likelihood analysis , a much higher likelihood is estimated	1
17301	So the walking activities of the seated passengers may be another explanation of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient	1
17302	This result indicates that the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin	1
17303	Taking the influence of human movement into consideration is still necessary and important for the infection control in enclosed environment .	1
17304	In a recent network and pathway analysis , responses were consistent with global activation of the immune response [ 54 ]	1
17305	Although genome wide searches and similar techniques have not been definitive , genes involved with B cell activation , such as @GENE$ and the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , have been identified [ 55 , 56 ]	1
17306	There is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [ 57 ]	1
17307	In this review we will focus on the literature surrounding these recent reports of antibody reactive cellular inclusions and B cell involvement .	1
17308	@DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ .	1
17309	Upon arrival in the lab , BAL - samples were processed for smear , bacterial culture , viral culture , and for the detection of influenzavirus A and B ; parainfluenzavirus types 1 , 2 , 3 ; RSV ; human metapneumovirus subtypes A and B ; coronaviruses 229E and OC43 , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ using an in - house multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction ( mPCR ) - protocol , as described previously [ 13 ]	1
17310	The performance of this test was assessed by regular participation in the external quality programme organised by QCMD ( West of Scotland Science Park Glasgow G20 0XA Scotland , UK ) .	1
17311	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) mediate the majority of fast excitatory transmission in the brain , and regulation of synaptic @GENE$ levels is important for controlling synapse development and function	1
17312	@GENE$ are assembled as @GENE$ comprised of various combinations of the pore - forming subunits @GENE$	1
17313	Subunit composition and association with @GENE$ determine the biophysical and trafficking properties of the channel ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 )	1
17314	@GENE$ can be regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications , such as ubiquitination , which controls receptor trafficking and degradation ( Goo et al	1
17315	, 2015 )	1
17316	Studies of the AMPAR @GENE$ , which shares 40 % - 50 % identity with rat @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Hart et al	1
17317	, 1995 ; Brockie et al	1
17318	, 2001 ) , in C	1
17319	elegans were the first to show that @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) are regulated by @GENE$ ( Burbea et al	1
17320	, 2002 )	1
17321	@GENE$ is directly conjugated to the @GENE$ of @GENE$ , providing a signal for @GENE$ endocytosis and subsequent degradation ( Burbea et al	1
17322	, 2002 )	1
17323	Later studies showed that all four @GENE$ , @GENE$ , are also regulated by @GENE$ ( Schwarz et al	1
17324	, 2010 ; Fu et al	1
17325	, 2011 ; Lin et al	1
17326	, 2011 ; Lussier et al	1
17327	, 2011 ; Widagdo et al	1
17328	, 2015 )	1
17329	Although several studies suggest that @GENE$ are likely ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane prior to internalization ( Burbea et al	1
17330	, 2002 ; Schwarz et al	1
17331	, 2010 ; Lin et al	1
17332	, 2011 ) , other studies propose that @GENE$ are ubiquitinated at endosomes ( Lussier et al	1
17333	, 2011 ; Widagdo et al	1
17334	, 2015 ) , prior to degradation in the lysosome	1
17335	Future research will be necessary to determine if stimulus type , intensity or duration determine the subcellular site of ubiquitination .	1
17336	The Relationship between R 0 and Initial Epidemic Growth Rate During the early phase of an epidemic , the observed exponential growth rate , k , is related to the basic reproduc - tive ratio , R 0 , of the infection	1
17337	Mathematically , k is just the dominant eigenvalue of the disease - free equilibrium , and one can show that k must satisfy	1
17338	Initially , DPPH radical was thought to be reduced to the corresponding hydrazine when it reacted with the donating hydrogen substances	1
17339	However , more recent studies have shown that what occurs is mainly a fast electron transfer from the sample to @GENE$ radical	1
17340	The abstraction of hydrogen from the sample by @GENE$ radical is marginal , because it occurs very slowly and depends on the hydrogen - bond accepting solvent	1
17341	Methanol and ethanol , solvents generally used for antioxidant ability assays , are strongly hydrogen bond - accepting , therefore the hydrogen - abstracting reaction occurs very slowly [ 5 ] .	1
17342	Hsu ( Culex quinquefasciatus ) and RML12 ( Aedes albopictus ) cells were maintained at 28 ° C in Leibovitz ' s L - 15 medium ( Gibco # 11415 ) containing 10 % tryptose phosphate broth solution , 15 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution	1
17343	@DISEASE$ virus ( NY99 - 4132 strain ) was used for the study	1
17344	C6 / 36 ( Aedes albopictus ) cells were maintained in RPMI medium at 28 ° C and were used to propagate the virus	1
17345	Vero cells maintained in EMEM at 37 ° C were used for plaque assays .	1
17346	Benchtop aerosol irradiation chamber	1
17347	A one - pass , dynamic aerosol / virus irradiation chamber was constructed in a similar configuration to that used by Ko et al	1

17351	A schematic overview of the system is shown in Fig	1

17354	Aerosolized viruses were generated by adding a virus solution into a high - output extended aerosol respiratory therapy ( HEART ) nebulizer ( Westmed , Tucson , AZ ) and operated using a dual - head pump ( Thermo Fisher 420 - 2901 - 00FK , Waltham , MA ) with an input flow rate of 11 L / min	1
17355	The aerosolized virus flowed into the irradiation chamber where it was mixed with independently controlled inputs of humidified and dried air	1
17356	Humidified air was produced by bubbling air through water , while dry air was provided by passing air through a desiccant air dryer ( X06 - 02 - 00 , Wilkerson Corp , Richland , MI )	1
17357	Adjusting the ratio of humid and dry air enabled control of the relative humidity ( RH ) within the irradiation chamber which , along with the nebulizer settings , determined the aerosol particle size distribution	1
17358	An optimal RH value of 55 % resulted in a distribution of aerosol particle sizes similar to the natural distribution from human coughing and breathing , which has been shown to be distributed around approximately 1 µm , with a significant tail of particles less than 1 µm 36 - 38 .	1
17359	A disadvantage of IPknot over Iterative HFold is that being an MEA - based method , @GENE$ does not produce free energy of the predicted structure	1
17360	Also to get the best prediction , the user needs to provide some guidance as to what type of structure to predict for the given sequence , e	1

17362	, whether pseudoknot - free or pseudoknotted .	1
17363	Our permutation tests show that the difference in accuracy of Iterative @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the DK - pk16 data set is not significant	1
17364	However , the superior accuracy of Iterative @GENE$ compared with @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the @GENE$ - pk168 data set is significant .	1
17365	In response to shared conservation issues that threaten bat populations , bat research has expanded from predominantly short - term , independent projects to sustained collaborative networks that provide training in skills that strengthen bat conservation efforts , from taxonomy to ecology and educational outreach to policy formulation [ 21 ]	1
17366	Numerous regional networks of bat research experts have been established around the world [ 4 , 21 ] ( Figure 1 )	1
17367	There are a number of advantages that coordinated , regional bat research initiatives have over country - specific efforts , specifically the ability to take effective action on shared threats spanning geographical , temporal , and disciplinary scales [ 21 ]	1
17368	Bats are highly mobile , and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries	1
17369	Without regional collaborations , conservation efforts in one country may be insufficient to counteract the threats towards a species elsewhere in its range [ 57 ]	1
17370	In just the same way , viruses with mobile hosts can be easily spread across borders and require cooperation among a broad array of experts to ensure the reduced risk of spillover and spread [ 78 ]	1
17371	Moreover , bats are long - lived and therefore require long - term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies [ 21 ]	1
17372	Finally , bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse , and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential [ 34 ]	1
17373	How , then , can @DISEASE$ surveillance programs best leverage the expertise of bat ecologists and conservationists to more fully understand the basic ecology of host species ? Furthermore , in return , how can bat experts learn from disease experts to understand the role of human threats in altering host - virus dynamics ? [ 21 ] and network websites .	1
17374	In this paper the graphical - oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented	1
17375	In particular , we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment	1
17376	As a proof of concept , the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of @GENE$ of H5N1 isolates ( micro level ) and @DISEASE$ viruses ( macro level )	1
17377	The results of this paper are hence twofold	1
17378	Firstly , this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large - scale phyloinformatics studies of @GENE$	1
17379	Secondly , the analysis of @GENE$ on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus ' s tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution .	1
17380	Results : We observed that heterologous expression of the @GENE$ in human @DISEASE$ cells led to stabilization of the cellular@GENE$  (@GENE$  ) pool , with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the@GENE$  subunit of@GENE$  and inhibition of@GENE$  activity	1
17381	Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of@GENE$  was not altered , its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells	1
17382	Further analysis revealed that@GENE$  protein could directly associate with the@GENE$  ,@GENE$  (@GENE$  ) and@GENE$  over expression resulted in reduced association of@GENE$  with the@GENE$  and@GENE$  components of the@GENE$ 	1
17383	Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay of the@GENE$  of@GENE$  and@GENE$  using@GENE$  and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of@GENE$  with the above regions , indicating that@GENE$  inhibited@GENE$  binding at@GENE$ 	1
17384	Conclusions : In this report we suggest a mechanism by which@GENE$  of HEV may inhibit host cell@GENE$  activity during the course of a viral infection .	1

17395	Background : The H1N1 @DISEASE$ virus has been circulating in the human population for over 95 years , first manifesting itself in the pandemic of 1917 - 1918	1
17396	Initial mortality was extremely high , but dropped exponentially over time	1
17397	@DISEASE$ viruses have high mutation rates , and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918	1
17398	The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored	1
17399	Methods : We have made a comprehensive historical analysis of mutational changes within H1N1 by examining over 4100 fully - sequenced H1@GENE$ This has allowed us to examine the genetic changes arising within H1N1 from 1918 to the present	1
17400	Results : We document multiple extinction events , including the previously known extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s , and an apparent second extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009	1
17401	These extinctions appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations	1
17402	At the time of its disappearance in 2009 , the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated over 1400 point mutations ( more than 10 % of the genome ) , including approximately 330 non - synonymous changes ( 7	1
17403	4 % of all codons )	1
17404	The accumulation of both point mutations and non - synonymous amino acid changes occurred at constant rates ( μ = 14	1
17405	4 and 2	1
17406	4 new mutations / year , respectively ) , and mutations accumulated uniformly across the entire @D@GENE$ We observed a continuous erosion over time of codon - specificity in H1N1 , including a shift away from host ( human , swine , and bird [ duck ] ) codon preference patterns	1
17407	Conclusions : While there have been numerous adaptations within the H1@GENE$ most of the genetic changes we document here appear to be nonadaptive , and much of the change appears to be degenerative	1
17408	We suggest H1N1 has been undergoing natural genetic attenuation , and that significant attenuation may even occur during a single pandemic	1
17409	This process may play a role in natural pandemic cessation and has apparently contributed to the exponential decline in mortality rates over time , as seen in all major human @DISEASE$ strains	1
17410	These findings may be relevant to the development of strategies for managing @DISEASE$ pandemics and strain evolution .	1
17411	We also compared our original @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ from the extended gene network with the Deshmukh et al	1
17412	data set and found three genes were upregulated ( @GENE$ , 1	1
17413	8 - fold ; @GENE$ , 1	1
17414	8 - fold ; and @GENE$ , fourfold ) and five genes were downregulated ( @GENE$ , 0	1
17415	6 - fold ; @GENE$ , 0	1
17416	6 - fold ; @GENE$ , 0	1
17417	7 - fold ; @GENE$ , 0	1
17418	5 - fold ; and @GENE$ , 0	1
17419	7 - fold ) in the @DISEASE$ cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts ( Deshmukh et al	1
17420	2015 ) .	1
17421	In vitro protein expression @GENE$ was expressed in - vitro using @GENE$ in a coupled transcriptiontranslation reaction ( TNT kit , Promega Corp	1
17422	, Wisconsin , USA ) following manufacturers protocol .	1
17423	Human @DISEASE$ ( Huh7 ) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum	1
17424	Cells were transfected with Lipofectin / Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen Corp	1
17425	, California , USA ) as per manufacturer ' s instructions	1
17426	For negative control conditions , cells were transfected with their respective@GENE$ 	1
17427	In all transfections , total DNA amount was equalized by adding@GENE$  .	1
17428	The K48 - linked polyubiquitination of proteins is a pre - requisite for the proteasomal degradation [ 95 ]	1
17429	Although the steady state amounts of @GENE$ were not affected by the addition of DIs , the @GENE$ presentation as the final consequence of @GENE$ degradation , was significantly enhanced	1
17430	This finding is in concert with previous studies which show that an enhanced @GENE$ antigen presentation did not necessarily correlate with the diminished half - life of @GENE$ [ 26 , 48 ]	1
17431	A possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of @GENE$ enters the @DISEASE$ following treatment with DIs and this does not reduce the overall lev@GENE$ f Gag that remains non - ubiquitinated	1
17432	In consistency with this possibility is the notion that only a fraction of de novo synthesized proteins ( approx	1
17433	5 - 10 % ) are enterin@GENE$  DRiP - pathway [ 96 ]	1
17434	Numerous studies show that targeting an antigen for degradation b@GENE$ asome represents a powerful approach to en@GENE$ tigen presentation and to induce an efficient cytotoxic T - cell ( CTL ) - response [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]	1
17435	We now show that also DIs can cause a significantly enh@GENE$ tigen presentati@GENE$ topes	1
17436	Thus , it is legitimate to speculate that DIs not only reduce viral replication but might also induce a better CTL recognition of HIV - 1 + cells in vivo .	1
17437	To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR - 619 and P22077 , HLAC [ 62 ] , prepared from human tonsil tissue , were infected with HIV - 1NL4 - 3	1
17438	HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV - 1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [ 52 , 53 ]	1
17439	The cells were infected with either T - cell ( X4 ) - or macrophage ( R5 ) - tropic HIV - 1NL4 - 3 standardized for equal amounts of @GENE$	1
17440	Following permanent ( up to 15 days post infection ) or structured treatment ( only day 1 and 3 post infection ) with increasing concentrations of the DIs PR - 619 or P22077 , cell culture supernatants were collected on the indicated days post infection ( dpi ) and analyzed for release of virus particles by measuring the virus associated @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) activity ( Figure 4A ) .	1
17441	Another nurse ( N2 ) added that : " the working environment is poor since we sit in the wards with patients all day long	1
17442	During lunch time we sit in a small room within the @DISEASE$ wards , which accommodates less than five people and the door doesn ' t even close	1
17443	" Nurse ( N4 ) said : " all patients are accommodated in the same wards , whether they are extensively drug - resistant TB ( @DISEASE$ ) or @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ patients , hmmm the wards layout is not proper	1
17444	We have to sit all day with patients and told that patients who are under treatment are not infectious ( emotional )	1
17445	"	1
17446	Viral particles were produced by calcium phosphate DNA transfection of HEK293T cells ( obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland )	1
17447	Single - cycle infection - competent viruses were produced by co - transfection of 3 DNAs coding @GENE$ , a @GENE$ coding @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( for a 10 cm plate : 4 , 4 and 1 μg each , respectively ) and @GENE$ were added at a @GENE$ / @GENE$ ratio of 1 to 3	1
17448	When indicated , this ratio was lowered to 1 to 0 , 07 by modifying the amount of @GENE$ transfected for a constant amount of @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
17449	Media was replaced 12 hours after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after	1
17450	Supernatants were first centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 10 minutes , then filtered through a 0 , 45 μm syringe - filter , prior to purification by ultracentrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 2 hours through a 25 % ( w / v ) sucrose cushion	1
17451	After ultracentrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and normalized by either exogenous - RT activity or by an in - house anti - @GENE$ ELISA , as described [ 39 ]	1
17452	Viral infectivity was determined 3 days after cell challenge by flow cytometry analysis ( in the case of @GENE$ ) or 24 hours PI by @GENE$ gal assay in HeLaP4 cells ( stably expressing the @GENE$ plus an @GENE$ , obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland ) with replicationcompetent HIV - 1	1
17453	The Env @GENE$ ratio of viral particles produced in the presence or absence of @GENE$ was carried out by gp120 and p24 ELISA , as described [ 53 ] .	1
17454	Vero cells were treated with either 100 µM to 2000 µM DFMO for 4 days or 1 µm to 100 µM DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0	1
17455	1	1
17456	At 24 hpi , supernatants were collected and titers were determined .	1
17457	Overall , this set of data indicates that @GENE$ are incorporated into virion particles and exert an antiviral effect in a manner that seems proportional to their intracellular levels	1
17458	Given that viral infectivity is likely multifactorial , we believe this data suggest that @GENE$ may be an important parameter of viral infectivity , although we believe it unlikely to be the only one .	1
17459	@DISEASE$ is primarily caused by the commensal bacteria normally residing in the URT [ 11 , 12 ]	1
17460	The most common causes of @DISEASE$ for children < 5 years of age are Streptococcus pneumoniae , followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus [ 11 ] although this varies over time and space	1
17461	From a rudimentary ecological perspective , the human respiratory tract can be defined as an ecosystem with two distinct niches : the URT , characterized by regular asymptomatic carriage of commensal bacteria , and the LRT , which is inhabited at a low abundance by bacteria in healthy individuals [ 13 ]	1
17462	During the first year after birth , the nasopharynx is rapidly colonized [ 14 ] and URT carriage is established via ongoing synergistic and antagonistic interactions among commensal bacteria [ 15 ]	1
17463	Although @DISEASE$ is an @DISEASE$ , microbial selection in the URT may play an important role in etiology as bacterial strains in the URT can be readily aspirated into the LRT	1
17464	For example , URT carriage is believed to be a necessary precursor of @DISEASE$ due to S	1
17465	pneumoniae [ 16 , 17 ] .	1
17466	The present HPLC - UV method had a lower LOQ compared to previous methods reported on analysis of lycorine , which were in the range of 1 - 34 g / mL [ 2 , 7 , 14 ]	1
17467	The lower sensitivity of the present method permits the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the ex vivo plant tissues as well as the callus culture samples .	1
17468	There still remain many questions regarding designing appropriate interventions to prevent or reduce @DISEASE$ transmission	1
17469	Of them , identification of risk factors for @DISEASE$ , a comprehensive understanding of natural animal reservoirs and vectors , and better determining transmission pathways seem to be paramount in developing appropriate interventions	1
17470	Priority should be given to addressing these questions if we hope to improve public health response to future index cases in new geographical areas	1
17471	It seems prudent to allocate resources to further globally enhance surveillance to quickly identify @DISEASE$ and to monitor for viral genetic changes as well as to conduct the necessary epidemiological studies to fill the aforementioned gaps in our knowledge regarding this new and dangerous threat .	1
17472	In recent years it has been well established that two major constituent parts of the @GENE$ system ( UPS ) - the @GENE$ and a number of @GENE$ - play a crucial role , not only in virus replication but also in the regulation of the immunogenicity of @DISEASE$ ( HIV - 1 )	1
17473	However , the role in HIV - 1 replication of the third major component , the deubiquitinating enzymes (@GENE$ rg@GENE$ nknown	1
17474	In this study , we show that the DUB - inhibitors ( DIs ) P22077 and PR - 619 , specific for the DUBs USP7 and USP47 , impair Ga@GENE$ cess@GENE$ d thereby@GENE$ uce the infectivity of released virions without affecting viral protease activity	1
17475	Furthe@GENE$ he replication capacity of X4 - and R5 - tropic HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 in human lymphatic tissue is decreased upon treatment with these inhibitors without affecting cell viability	1
17476	Most strikingly , combinatory treatment with DIs and proteasome inhibitors synergistically blocks virus replication at concentrations where mono - treatment was ineffective , indicating that DIs can boost the therapeutic effect of proteasome inhibitors	1
17477	In addition , P22077 and PR - 619 increa@GENE$ poly@GENE$ ation of Gag and thus its entry int@GENE$ e UPS and the major histocompatibility c@GENE$ ur data point towards a model in which specific inhibitors of DUBs not only interfere wi@GENE$ rus spread but also increase the immune recognition of HIV - 1 expressing cells .	1
17478	It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s population is infected with @DISEASE$ which is responsible for 2 - 3 million deaths annually [ 1 ]	1
17479	A study conducted by Valjee and van Dyk [ 2 ] in South Africa , reported that nurses caring for patients living with @DISEASE$ related illnesses , including @DISEASE$ expressed anxiety , helplessness , and vulnerability .	1
17480	HAdV - E ( HAdV - 4 ) types were also observed .	1

17483	Can reassortment explain these findings ? Based on our mutation count analysis , there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage , and it has gone extinct , apparently twice	1
17484	From other studies , various influenza strains are obviously derived from reassortment , but all this does is set the mutation clock back a little	1
17485	Any reassortment between a " fresh " virus and a high - mutation - count virus will inevitably lead to , at best , an averaging of the mutational load of the two	1
17486	The 2009 - 2010 " @DISEASE$ " virus shows evidence of multiple reassortment events in a limited portion of its genome , and it was more robust than the lingering human H1N1 strain that it replaced , but it carries a great number of non - adaptive and presumably deleterious mutations	1
17487	Reassortment between two viruses of different immunological character might preserve the less degraded genome , but only temporarily .	1
17488	The cells were incubated with @GENE$ ( 1 : 100 ) ( catalog no	1
17489	F2012 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and @GENE$ ( 1 : 100 ) ( catalog no	1
17490	T6778 ; Sigma - Aldrich )	1
17491	Subsequently , the cells were stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( 1 : 1000 ) ( catalog no	1
17492	D8417 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 15 min and examined using a Leica SP2 confocal system ( Leica Microsystems , GmbH , Wetzlar , Germany ) .	1
17493	HEK293T cells grown in 6 - well plates ( Nunc , Waltham , MA , USA ) were cotransfected with 5 µg of @GENE$ and 3 µg of @GENE$ using an X - tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent ( catalog no	1
17494	06366236001 ; Roche , Penzberg , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
17495	Briefly , the cells were transfected with 400 µL of serum - free DMEM containing 8 µg of @GENE$ and 12 µL of X - tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent	1
17496	At 6 h post - transfection ( hpt ) , the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and incubated for an additional 48 h before being assayed .	1
17497	Our microbiological culture method could detect bacterial pathogens in 21	1

17510	pneumoniae is a predominant cause of < 5 child mortality and despite the vaccination program , it is responsible for at least 18 % of severe @DISEASE$ and 33 % of deaths worldwide [ 25 ]	1
17511	Other studies conducted in Kenya , Zambia , Nepal , and Brazil reported S	1
17512	pneumoniae as the most frequently isolated bacteria and the isolation rate ranged from 15	1

17514	8 % [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]	1
17515	K	1
17516	pneumoniae had been described as the most common cause of @DISEASE$ in Jordan and India [ 30 , 31 ]	1
17517	It is known that bacterial colonization is mostly facilitated by physical damages of respiratory cells caused by @DISEASE$	1
17518	However , Yu et al	1
17519	reported that bacterial colonization following @DISEASE$ has no effect on clinical manifestation of @DISEASE$ [ 32 ]	1
17520	Furthermore , the role of bacterial pathogens in @DISEASE$ symptoms is ambiguous as recent studies of asymptomatic @DISEASE$ cases reported frequent bacterial colonization [ 33 ] and our study also found comparable detection rates of S	1
17521	pneumoniae in both asymptomatic and symptomatic children	1
17522	Many of the bacteria found as coinfection partners with virus in this study , are pathogenic	1
17523	When bacteria enter a body , the host must elicit immune responses against the invading organisms	1
17524	However , the immune responses are not always beneficial and sometimes these responses can be harmful , such as in case of hyper immune responses	1
17525	Even the immune responses elicited by one organism may compromise the immune responses elicited by another organism	1
17526	Although the pathogenic role of bacterial coinfections with viruses is unclear , they might have involvement in disease pathogenicity	1
17527	One study reported that , colonization of pathogenic bacteria in airway stimulate topical immune responses [ 34 ] and this phenomenon may play important role in compromising host immune responses	1
17528	Most of the bacteria isolated during the study period including S	1
17529	pneumonia , K	1
17530	pneumaniae , H	1
17531	influenzae , and E	1
17532	agglomerans fall in either community - acquired or nosocomical categories , suggesting appropriate preventive measures could limit bacterial involvement in ARIs .	1
17533	Previous studies have shown that ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway plays an important role in mammalian cells during @DISEASE$ [ 25 , 31 ]	1
17534	Studies have also shown that ubiquitinre@GENE$ ated following bacterial infection in mosquito cells [ 32 ]	1

17558	It is therefore reasonable to ask if the striking reduction in H1N1 mortality might be due , in part , to natural attenuation resulting from deleterious mutation accumulation	1
17559	Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918 , but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1 - related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain	1
17560	Likewise , improved medical treatments , such as antibiotic treatment for @DISEASE$ , were certainly a significant factor reducing H1N1 mortality , but these do not appear to fully explain the nature of the pattern of mortality decline seen for H1N1	1
17561	For example , the exponential decline in mortality began before the invention of antibiotic treatment .	1
17562	Conventional oilseed rape ( OSR ) seed , variety ' Hearty ' was a gift from Christine Lewis , NIAB	1

17568	After centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 mins , the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and @GENE$ from the oilseed rape @GENE$ was extracted from seedlings from a selfed MS8 / RF3 plant [ 17 ] using DNeasy Plant DNA Extraction Kit ( QIAGEN , Crawley , UK )	1

17575	Five R5 clade C transmitted / founder Env pseudotyped strains were constructed as described [ 71 , 72 ]	1
17576	Briefly , @GENE$ from the transmitted founder strains were cloned into @GENE$	1
17577	The pseudotyped viruses were then produced by co - transfecting 293T cells with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ - , and fugene 6 ( Roche ) .	1
17578	Our results indicate that @GENE$ may be responsible for shuttling IgG - bound HIV - 1 across epithelial cells in the genital tract	1
17579	This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for @GENE$ in @GENE$ shuttling across tissues [ 34 , 35 , 43 ]	1
17580	Mice expressing @GENE$ in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver @GENE$ to the luminal intestinal surface , which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the @GENE$ back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4 + T cells [ 34 ]	1
17581	In addition , @DISEASE$ ( CMV ) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti - CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages [ 35 ]	1
17582	Under these conditions , the virus did not replicate	1
17583	However , in explants from @DISEASE$ women with low or undetectable neutralizing an@GENE$ tion readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact , uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer	1
17584	Thus , it appeared that neutralizing an@GENE$ tion after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer	1
17585	On the other hand , non - neutraliz@GENE$  promoted infection	1
17586	Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn , and when@GENE$  on explant@GENE$  blocked , IgG - virion co@GENE$ orted across the surface [ 35 ]	1

17589	For example , it was mentioned that private practitioners make substantial profits when dispensing antibiotics as it added to their income .	1
17590	The energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth , resulting in a 0	1
17591	33 million tons decrease , accounting for 64	1
17592	95 % of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value .	1
17593	Inadequate infrastructure to facilitate optimal infection prevention and control measures was the most commonly cited challenge in addressing @DISEASE$	1
17594	Though infection prevention and control efforts were highly regulated in both the public and private hospital settings , certain contextual factors such as lack of sufficient single room facility were highly challenging to overcome	1
17595	A few participants mentioned that the design of hospital wards with one room having six beds or eight beds was not conducive to prevent infections : " It ' s not really our fault	1
17596	You are sitting here scolding us , that we have a lot of MRSA but it ' s because , it ' s not poor infection control	1
17597	You are making us take care of patients in overcrowded hospitals	1
17598	You know , it ' s very different from the US or Europe where most of their rooms are two - bedders	1
17599	If you have a six - bedder , even if I wash my hands , the uncle there who has a maid , and the maid is talking to the other maid and they all share , you know	1
17600	.	1
17601	and it ' s practically , it ' s all crowded , all these infrastructure issues	1
17602	" - I04 , Human Health	1
17603	Recent work indicates that persistent phagocytic microglia contribute to prolonged @DISEASE$ following @DISEASE$ [ 8 ] , and thus , limiting microglial activation may alleviate the associated @DISEASE$ sequelae .	1
17604	Identity and purity ( > 95 % ) of all compounds were determined by chromatography ( silica or RP - 18 HPLC ) , by fully assigned 1 H - and 13 C NMR spectra ( see supplementary NMR spectra ) and by high - resolution mass spectra	1
17605	Solvents were purchased in p	1

17607	quality by VWR	1
17608	Study participants ( n = 1455 ) were recruited from the @DISEASE$ susceptibility ( @DISEASE$ ) cross sectional study querying @DISEASE$ burden in an adult population in South - Baden , Germany [ 16 ]	1
17609	The study protocol was approved by community officials and the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg ( Ref	1
17610	No	1
17611	258 / 11 _ 120365 )	1
17612	Based on the RTI history - score individuals of putative low , medium and high risk of future @DISEASE$ were invited to the actual sub - cohort	1
17613	The RTI history score is summarizing information on the frequency and severity of @DISEASE$ and antibiotics use over the past two years , selfassessed @DISEASE$ susceptibility , and occurrence of selected severe infections [ 16 ]	1
17614	Study participants were requested to fill - in an additional questionnaire ( baseline questionnaire ) on lifestyle factors and co - morbidities and to complete monthly diaries registering the monthly occurrence and the duration ( < 2 weeks , > 2 weeks ) of @DISEASE$ , namely @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$ , from the beginning of November to the end of April of three seasons : 2012 / 13 , 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15	1
17615	Furthermore , the intake of antibiotics , doctor visits , hospitalisation for @DISEASE$ and the impact of @DISEASE$ symptoms on their daily activities were queried	1
17616	Further recruitment details into the @DISEASE$ study and the present sub - cohort are presented under Additional files 1 and 2	1
17617	Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study .	1
17618	The @GENE$ data from cases analysed from a third country with contemporaneous @DISEASE$ outbreaks showed that the NZ FPV strains segregated with @DISEASE$ vaccine viruses	1
17619	The virological findings from these cases yet again highlight the difficulty of diagnosing @DISEASE$ in cats that have recently received MLV vaccines , as well as raising important questions about the potential capacity of reversion to virulence of MLV vaccines	1
17620	The diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in cases from NZ was initially based on consistent clinical signs and a positive faecal antigen test	1
17621	Point - of - care immunochromatographic assays designed to detect CPV faecal antigen also detect FPV , so are used in practice for the diagnostic investigation of cats with clinical signs consistent with @DISEASE$ [ 22 ]	1
17622	However , faecal antigen tests detect both field and vaccine strains of FPV and CPV	1
17623	In one stud@GENE$ rcial CPV faecal antigen kits , 20 % of cats vaccinated against FPV in the preceding 14 days returned positive test results [ 29 ] .	1
17624	With the moving person and the index patient excluded , the average infection risk of all the seated passengers is 0	1
17625	2015 , 0	1
17626	2051 and 0	1
17627	2096 for case 1 ~ 3 , respectively	1
17628	This result also proves that human movement may increase the infection risk in the airplane cabin	1
17629	Especially , in case 2 and 3 , the infection risk of the moving person is 0	1
17630	55 for moving speed of 0	1
17631	5 m / s and 0	1
17632	51 for 1	1
17633	0 m / s , significantly higher than most of the seated passengers ( 62 passengers for case 2 and 58 for case 3 )	1
17634	This result indicates that the infection possibilities of the crew members ( who need to walk in the airplane cabin frequently during the flight ) may be even higher than 50 %	1
17635	For the seated passengers , walking along the aisle ( e	1
17636	g	1
17637	go to the washroom ) and passing through the high - dose region ( around the index patient ) may also significantly increase their intake doses and result in much higher infection risks .	1
17638	where P I is the infection risk of the susceptible passenger after the flight , which demonstrates the infection possibility of the susceptible passenger ; t 0 is the exposure time interval of the flight , hr ; f s is the cough frequency , 18 / hr [ 46 ] ; r l is the infectivity of pathogens in the droplets of the lth size bin ; and r is the integrated infectivity factor for all pathogens	1
17639	For the SARS - CoV , the infectivity of pathogens contained in the droplets of different size classes show no differences , hence the infectivity r l can be expressed as r	1
17640	According to the experiments on mice for the development of vaccine , efficient replication of the virus is found in the respiratory tract of the mice after they are administered at a very low dose of the SARS - CoV [ 47 , 48 ] , indicating high infectivity of the SARS - CoV	1
17641	Since no other infectivity data is found , the infectivity factor r is assumed as 1 per pfu of virus in this work because of the high infectivity of the SARS - CoV	1
17642	In Eq	1
17643	( 2 ) , N c f s t 0 D ( x , t 0 ) can also be regarded as the intake dose of the passenger	1
17644	To evaluate the effects of different human movement behaviors , the intake fractions of the seated passengers can be expressed as followed :	1
17645	The data were double entered and compared on a daily basis using Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 6	1
17646	0 ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA , USA )	1
17647	Statistical analyses were performed using Stata / MP 10	1
17648	0 for Macintosh ( Stata Corporation , College Station , TX , USA )	1
17649	The 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for proportions were calculated with binominal exact confidence interval using the ' ci ' command	1
17650	Of the children included in this analysis , 274 were enrolled twice and 18 thrice	1
17651	We used the ' cluster ' option in Stata to adjust the confidence intervals of the proportions for repeated enrollments and thus allowed for possible dependence of observations in a child that was included more than once	1
17652	Anthropometric measures were expressed as Z - scores , which were generated using the WHO Child Growth Standards 2005 [ 23 ]	1
17653	Meteorological data for the Kathmandu airport weather station ( located approximately 10 km from Bhaktapur ) were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology , Ministry of Environment , Science and Technology , Kathmandu , Nepal	1
17654	Mean daily values for relative humidity and temperature were calculated as the average of two daily measurements ( relative humidity at 8	1
17655	45 AM and 5	1
17656	45 PM , and maximum and minimum temperature )	1
17657	We estimated the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient to describe the association between the monthly number of infections with each virus and meteorological factors .	1
17658	The control of this @DISEASE$ disease in Asia , the Middle East , and North Africa has been mainly restricted to the use of vaccines , and yet H9N2 viruses have evolved antigenically [ 56 ] and spread to new geographic areas , causing huge economic losses to the poultry industry	1
17659	H9N2 viruses have shown to be highly promiscuous and to be carriers of particularly advantageous genes for the emergence of LPAI reassortant strains with zoonotic potential , such as the H7N9 and H10N8 viruses [ 57 ]	1
17660	Moreover , there are serological and virological evidences	1
17661	Background : Improving accuracy and efficiency of computational methods that predict @GENE$ secondary structures is an ongoing challenge	1
17662	Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of @GENE$ that they can predict	1
17663	Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy ; however , there are not many methods for prediction of @GENE$ structures that can incorporate structural information as input	1
17664	There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information .	1
17665	Another sub - theme that emerged from the literature was the impact of globalization on local preparedness , prevention strategies , but more importantly , on the attribution of blame for the spread of the outbreak	1
17666	While there is emphasis , in the narrative on SARs , for municipal governments to consider the globalized nature of the outbreak ; ( Keil and Ali 2007 ) , consistent with the politics of epidemics literature , which asserts that blame is typically placed on cultural and ethnic minority groups , significant blame was placed on the Asian - Canadian community .	1
17667	@DISEASE$ has been predominantly reported in lowincome countries , with the last outbreak in 2014 reported to have caused 11 , 323 deaths worldwide and 4809 deaths in Liberia alone ( Abramowitz et al	1
17668	2015 )	1
17669	The most affected countries typically had poor health infrastructure ( Arima and Shimada 2014 ; Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; McNamara 2016 ; Maras and Miranda 2016 )	1
17670	It is only during the most recent outbreak that the virus spread to high - income countries ( Burkle and Burkle 2015 ; Stanturf et al	1
17671	2015 )	1
17672	Within these countries , and as was exemplified in Liberia , the outbreak mostly affected those populations that were very poor , remote , and lacked proper physical infrastructure , including roads , proper sanitation , and health facilities .	1
17673	To assess the role in @GENE$ of sequences 3 of the @GENE$ , a series of in - frame deletions were introduced into pDluc / PRRSV , starting from the 3 end of the inserted @GENE$	1
17674	RNAs transcribed from these @GENE$ were translated in @GENE$ in the presence of @GENE$ ( Figure 2A )	1
17675	@GENE$ was found to be unaffected until the length of the @GENE$ downstream of the @GENE$ fell below 21 nt , at which point @GENE$ was reduced ( 18 nt ) or abolished ( 15 or 9 nt )	1
17676	In the latter constructs , the @GENE$ is compromised , consistent with an important role in @GENE$ EASE$	1
17677	Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells ( Li et al	1
17678	, ( 19 ) )	1
17679	To investigate the function o@GENE$ egion specifically , we prepared a library of individual point mutations within , and flanking @GENE$ egion and assessed their effe@GENE$ n PRF ( Figure 2B )	1
17680	It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effe@GENE$ n PRF , with the exception of the final resi@GENE$  C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence ) , where the effect was more modest	1
17681	As an explanation for these observations , we speculated that the RNA downstream o@GENE$ uence may interact@GENE$ PCBPs @GENE$ egi@GENE$ V RNA required for full activi@GENE$ n @GENE$ 21 nt ) has onl@GENE$ tches , whereas previously establ@GENE$ ences more commonly have three ( or m@GENE$ plets , potentially with each triplet bindin@GENE$ omain ( ( 33 ) ; see below )	1
17682	Howe@GENE$ PCBP@GENE$ PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate@GENE$ [UNK] in association screens , and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown ( 34 , 3@GENE$ PCBPs could therefore bind t@GENE$  mRNA by virtue of an association@GENE$ [UNK] .	1
17683	We represent an @GENE$ by a sequence , S , of its four bases , Adenine ( A ) , Cytosine ( C ) , Guanine ( G ) and Uracil ( U )	1
17684	We denote the length of the @GENE$ by n and refer to each base by its index i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n .	1
17685	Although the overall structure of @GENE$ in complex with diplacone is similar to those of the @GENE$ and the complex with @GENE$ , there are interesting structural differences between the @GENE$ and the complexes with @GENE$ and diplacone that provide useful information regarding the development of natural geranylated flavonoid - based synthetic inhibitors ( Fig	1
17686	3b )	1
17687	Asp291 in the @GENE$ , which is a mechanistically important acid / base catalyst ( Crennell et al	1
17688	, 1993 ) , rotates by approximately 120 compared with the apo structure to make a hydrogen bond to the 3 0 - hydroxyl of diplacone or the 4 0 - hydroxyl of Neu5Ac	1
17689	Moreover , the rotation of Asp291 also induces a conformational change of Ile327 in the @GENE$ compared with both complexes	1
17690	Relative to the @GENE$ , in the @GENE$ Ile327 moves to make a suitable hydrophobic interaction with the - carbon of Asp291 and the 5 0 - acetamide moiety of the @GENE$ molecule	1
17691	@GENE$ and the @GENE$ complex showed a hydrogen - bond interaction mediated by one water molecule ( W1 ) , the position of which nearly overlaps with the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac	1
17692	On the other hand , the hydrogen bond between Asp328 and the 4 0 - hydroxyl group of The @GENE$ with diplacone	1

17696	Hydrogen bonds are displayed as dashed lines .	1
17697	We observed that 7 % of the reviewed sequences that contains at least one putative @GENE$ correspond to the @GENE$ from various viruses	1
17698	Because @GENE$ are processed co - and post - translationally by both @GENE$ , we ran a systematic PubMed search with the terms ' name of the virus C autophagy ' followed by ' name of the @GENE$ ' to restrain the result outcome as necessary , finally we looked for papers ( excluding reviews and commentaries ) that specifically mention proteins derived from the processing of the @GENE$ .	1
17699	Aerial parts and seeds of Foeniculum vulgare Mill	1
17700	oils possess different chemical compositions , nevertheless in what concerns the antioxidant activity , the authors in [ 57 ] found that for higher concentrations of essential oils ( > 750 mg / L for the aerial parts and > 1 , 000 mg / L for seeds ) a decrease of the activity was observed , suggesting that high concentrations of essential oils possess a pro - oxidant activity , independent of their richness in trans - anethole ( aerial parts ) or methyl chavicol ( seeds ) .	1

17714	Our BLAST procedure also identified weakly related Bartonella from rodents ( e	1

17718	, 89 % to Procyon lotor from the United States [ CP019786 ] )	1
17719	However , these livestock , rodent , and carnivore sequences formed separate phylogenetic clades from bat - and bat flyderived Bartonella sequences ( Fig 3 )	1
17720	Despite the geographic proximity of our field sites to Brazil , our BLAST procedure found no Bartonella seqeunces similar to those recently described in Brazilian bat or rodent species [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]	1
17721	An additional phylogenetic tree that includes these recently identified Bartonella is provided in S1 Fig .	1

17735	First , 600 l per well of basolateral supernatants from JEV - infected porcine NEC were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24 - well plates	1
17736	Next , 10 6 monocytes were added into Transwell inserts with 3 - m - diameter pores ( Becton , Dickinson ) and placed in the wells filled with the porcine NEC culture - derived basolateral medium	1
17737	After 3 h of incubation at 39 ° C and 5 % CO 2 , basolateral medium was harvested and total monocytes were harvested and quantified	1

17741	For monocyte quantification by flow cytometry , CountBright absolute counting beads ( Thermo Fisher ) were used following the manufacturer ' s manual	1
17742	Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward / side scatter plots , followed by exclusion of doublets .	1
17743	Given that HIV - 1 in genital tract secretions may be complexed with @GENE$ , that female genital tract secretions are acidic , and that @GENE$ has been demonstrated in genital tract tissues , we evaluated the role of pH and antibody on transcytosis of HIV - 1 through polarized epithelial cells .	1
17744	Of particular interest in our @GENE$ is the expression of @GENE$ which codes for the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ , a subunit that is highly and predominantly expressed in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes ( Marionneau et al	1
17745	2005 )	1
17746	This gene is expressed at low levels in our @GENE$ but is regulated from a suggestive @GENE$ on @GENE$ ( one of the three @GENE$ from which our gene network is coregulated )	1
17747	Since expression of this subunit is associated with nodal tissues , upregulation of @GENE$ , subsequent to dysregulation of our gene network , could predispose to gain of pacemaker activity	1
17748	In support of this , @GENE$ expression is reported to be highly sensitive to dosage of the transcription factor @GENE$ ( Mori et al	1
17749	2006 ) , another gene in our extended @GENE$	1
17750	@GENE$ is an essential factor for development of the cardiac conduction system including the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches ( Arnolds et al	1
17751	2012 ; Mori et al	1
17752	2006 ; Moskowitz et al	1
17753	2004 )	1
17754	@GENE$ has also been shown to interact and cooperate with both @GENE$ ( Hiroi et al	1
17755	2001 ; Puskaric et al	1
17756	2010 ) and @GENE$ ( Munshi et al	1
17757	2009 ) ( also in our @GENE$ ) to drive commitment to a nodal cell phenotype ( Stefanovic et al	1
17758	2014 )	1
17759	Since @GENE$ is known to suppress the nodal phenotype ( Ye et al	1
17760	2015 ) , a fine balance between @GENE$ interactions with @GENE$ vs	1
17761	@GENE$ may underlie the maintenance of the working myocardium in the pulmonary myocardium .	1
17762	The current therapy against @DISEASE$ , consisting of a combination of pegy@GENE$ N @GENE$ d ribavirin ( RBV ) , is limited by resistance , adverse effects , and high costs	1
17763	The absence of preventive regiment is a major limitation for patients undergoing LT for @DISEASE$	1
17764	Moreover , accelerated progression to @DISEASE$ after graft reinfection and limited efficacy of IFN - based therapies for re@GENE$ ent @DISEASE$ are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the @DISEASE$ recipients [ 80 ]	1
17765	Thus , novel preventive and therapeutic antivirals are urgently needed	1
17766	Viral entry is required for initiation , spread , and maintenance of infection	1
17767	HCV entry is a multistep process orchestrated by a number of viral and host c@GENE$ 	1
17768	To date , little data has been reported on the characteristics of @DISEASE$ during @DISEASE$ , especially in immunocompetent patients	1
17769	In this study , we compared the characteristics of @DISEASE$ in Adv and Non - Adv group patients	1
17770	The Adv group patients had a longer duration of @DISEASE$ and a higher proportion of peak body temperature than patients infected with other various @DISEASE$ or unknown pathogens	1
17771	Similarly , Ho et al [ 22 ] observed that viral mono - pathogen patients had a higher mean body temperature than bacterial mono - pathogen patients	1
17772	In addition , dualpathogen patients , such as S	1
17773	pneumoniae with either @DISEASE$ or B , had a higher mean body temperature , although not significantly different from the respective mono - pathogens	1
17774	However , there is still a lack of detailed data on the specific pathogen - related clinical characteristics , especially @DISEASE$ , in immunocompetent patients	1
17775	Thus , our data is more likely to aid physicians in determining further diagnostic or therapeutic considerations at the time of admission	1
17776	We also evaluated the response to antipyretic treatment between the Adv and Non - Adv groups	1
17777	Our data showed that the Adv group patients exhibited a higher proportion of individuals with no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non - Adv or unknown pathogen group patients	1
17778	Weisse et al	1
17779	[ 23 ] evaluated the effect of acetaminophen on fever in @DISEASE$	1
17780	viral infections in 100 children	1
17781	They concluded that there is no correlation between a fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the @DISEASE$ , revealing no usefulness in the response to antipyretic treatment in predicting etiologies of @DISEASE$	1
17782	However , our data suggest that there may be a difference in the antipyretic response to Adv compared to other etiologies , and this is the first such data reported for immunocompetent adults .	1
17783	@DISEASE$ mediated @DISEASE$ represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public health 1	1
17784	Common examples are @DISEASE$ , appearing in seasonal 3 and pandemic 4 forms , and bacterially - based @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , increasingly emerging in multi - drug resistant form .	1
17785	Media was cleared from cells and Trizol reagent ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA , USA ) directly added	1
17786	The lysate was then collected , and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer ' s protocol utilizing the Direct - zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit ( Zymo Research )	1
17787	Purified RNA was subsequently used for @GENE$ synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits ( Thermo - Fischer ) , according to the manufacturer ' s protocol , with 10 - 100 ng of RNA and @GENE$ .	1
17788	A previously healthy 4 - year - old girl became @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
17789	She had been febrile with chills for 4 days ( 39 • C ) , breathless and coughing for 2 days	1
17790	She had visited the general practitioners twice , and treated symptomatically but with no antibiotic prescription	1
17791	She had vomited and passed watery stool	1
17792	Her immunizations were up - to - date and she received one dose of 7 - valent pneumococcal vaccine at age 2 years	1
17793	The young brother had recovered from a recent febrile coughing episode	1
17794	Because of increasing @DISEASE$ of breath , the mother took her to the emergency department	1
17795	Her vitals were : heart rate 165 / min , respiratory rate 30 / min , tympanic temperature 36	1
17796	7 • C , SaO 2 79 % in room air , and decreased air entry to right lung	1
17797	Supplemental oxygen of 6 liter / min was immediately given	1
17798	Chest radiography showed @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ ( Figure 1 ) .	1
17799	Sequencing of primate PARP genes @GENE$ were amplified from DNA isolated from cell lines obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories ( Camden , NJ ) , the FrozenZoo ( San Diego , CA ) , ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) and the Tulane National Primate Research Center ( Covington , LA ) ( Table S1 )	1
17800	Sequences were amplified by PCR using @GENE$ using primers that anneal to the introns around @GENE$ ( primer sequences in Table S2 )	1
17801	@GENE$ were amplified from RNA isolated from cell lines ( Table S1 )	1
17802	Sequences were amplified by one step reversetranscription PCR using SuperScript III One - Step RT - PCR with @GENE$ ( Invitrogen ) to produce @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) using the primers listed in Table S2	1
17803	Repeated attempts to amplify @GENE$ from Siamang gibbon failed , supporting the conclusion that gibbons have lost @GENE$	1
17804	@GENE$ were directly sequenced using internal primers by Sanger sequencing	1
17805	Sequences from gorilla and squirrel monkey ( Saimiri boliviensis ) were obtained from publically available genome assemblies .	1
17806	Likewise , our data highlight @GENE$ as likely focal points of host - virus conflicts	1
17807	However , in contrast to @GENE$ , which we hypothesize is on the ' offense ' i	1
17808	e	1
17809	, specifically targeting @GENE$ , the widely distributed pattern of positively selected sites within the @GENE$ is reminiscent of other @GENE$ that are evolving on the ' defensive ' side ( i	1
17810	e	1
17811	, directly targeted by viral antagonists ) of evolutionary arms races [ 34 ]	1
17812	In these cases , the @GENE$ is performing a general antiviral function , such as shutting down host mRNA translation in the case of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , or transducing an antiviral transcriptional program as in the case of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
17813	As a result of their broad action , @GENE$ and @GENE$ are antagonized by an array of proteins from diverse viral lineages that interact with different regions on the proteins [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 ]	1
17814	The widely distributed pattern of positive selection in @GENE$ [ 58 ] and @GENE$ [ 59 ] likely reflects this ' defense ' against ( or escape from ) multiple antagonists	1
17815	We postulate that the dispersed pattern of selection we observe in @GENE$ similarly reflects selection to escape recognition by a variety of distinct viral antagonists of a hypothesized @GENE$ antiviral response ( see below ) , rather than selection to maintain or establish recognition of @GENE$ .	1
17816	We observed similar results in a different context	1
17817	Despite the dearth of vaccination against pneumococcus in our population , @DISEASE$ is a major segment of the @DISEASE$ burden	1
17818	Treatment of these infections is often problematic because the empirical use of antibiotics or antivirals is not consensual [ 25 ]	1
17819	Vaccine development , particularly against RSV , is warranted to prevent @DISEASE$ in children	1
17820	Moreover , the impact of influenza vaccine policies in developing countries should be evaluated because this virus often causes @DISEASE$ [ 26 ] .	1
17821	In cats , infection could be promoted by concurrent immunosuppressive infections such as FIV or FeLV [ 13 , 31 ]	1
17822	The fact that cats appear to better control the infection and more rarely manifest the disease is also in favour of a potential persistent source role of infected individuals	1
17823	Moreover , the population of pet and stray cats may be even larger than that of dogs in some endemic areas [ 44 ] .	1

17848	Univariate analysis revealed that S	1
17849	pneumoniae , human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus detection in nasal swabs were significantly associated with @DISEASE$ in Mali ( Table 3 )	1
17850	Multivariate analysis reinforced linkage of these pathogens with @DISEASE$ , independently of patient age , gender , period per quarter and the presence of other pathogens significantly coupled with increased risk of @DISEASE$ ( Table 3 )	1
17851	PAF was the highest for S	1

17867	The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO - specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR )	1

17873	The pathways were enriched and ranked according to their p - values by the Metacore TM database ( Supplementary Table S4 )	1
17874	These pathways are involved in processes of cell cycle regulation , cytoskeleton remodelling , cell apoptosis and survival , oxidative phosphorylation , and immune response	1
17875	Notably , eight @GENE$ were enriched in the pathway involved in the " @GENE$ folding and maturation " with a p - value of 9	1
17876	398E - 06 ( Supplementary Fig	1
17877	S1 )	1
17878	The detailed analysis depicted in Fig	1
17879	6 indicates that eight @GENE$ were directly or indirectly associated with the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ )	1
17880	Among them , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were up - regulated during infection , which can directly degrade the abnormal @GENE$ 35 , 36	1
17881	@GENE$ - MS data were verified by western blotting	1
17882	The verification of @GENE$ by western blotting was limited by the availability of @GENE$ to @GENE$	1
17883	Initial tests selected a set of proteins that were significantly changed during infection and also reliably cross - reacted with @GENE$ to the corresponding human protein	1
17884	As shown in Fig	1
17885	7 , the western blots confirmed the differential expression of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ or @GENE$ ) detected by @GENE$ .	1
17886	The nature of membrane rearrangements has been well studied in both @DISEASE$ CoV and @DISEASE$ infected cells by conventional transmission electron microscopy or by electron tomography	1
17887	Both viruses have been shown to induce double membrane vesicles ( DMVs ) as well as regions of convoluted membranes [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]	1
17888	Electron tomography data showed that the convoluted membranes in SARS - CoV infected cells were derived from and joine@GENE$ rough ER	1
17889	In addition , the outer membranes of the DMVs were interlinked , studded with ribosomes and were also joined to the convoluted membr@GENE$ s and ER	1
17890	Openings between the interior of the DMVs and the cytoplasm were not observed [ 7 ]	1
17891	In contrast , ribosomes were not seen on the membranes of MHV induced structures [ 8 ]	1
17892	Preliminary work presented here ( Figure 1 ) shows for the first time that IBV infection of mammalian Vero cells also results in the induction of DMVs	1
17893	However , a detailed analysis of the membrane rearrangements triggered by IBV infection of mammalian and avian cells remains to be performed	1
17894	The site of assembly of coronavirus RTCs is currently unclear	1
17895	During the process of transcription and replicatio@GENE$ l genom@GENE$ nse RNAs are synthesised	1
17896	As a @GENE$  , dsRNA can form , possibly as a replicative intermediat@GENE$ is dsRNA has been used as a marker for @GENE$ of viral RNA synthesis	1
17897	However , in SARS - CoV infected@GENE$  , dsRNA was found to predominantly locate on the interior of DMVs while the majority of the nsps were found to locate on the convoluted membranes	1
17898	High resolution immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a separation in the sig@GENE$ for @GENE$ nd dsRNA	1
17899	In addition , due to the lack of any connecting channels between the interior of DMVs and the cytoplasm , questions were raised about transport of RNA to sites of virus assembly at the ERGIC [ 7 ]	1
17900	Subsequent work using 5 - ethynyl uridine ( EU ) @GENE$ cent RNA demonstrated a degree of co - localisation betwee@GENE$ nd dsRNA signals at earlier time points of infection but this co - localisation was significantly reduced at later time points [ 10 ]	1
17901	Therefore , further evidence is required to determine the precise location of coronavirus RTCs and the site of RNA synthesis .	1
17902	Nurses who care for dying patients are under pressure emotionally because of their beliefs and values about death as well as the emotions and reactions of the patients and their families	1
17903	Despite @DISEASE$ being a curable disease , in almost all new cases , professionals such as psychologists , anthropologists , sociologists , and @DISEASE$ analysts have repeatedly indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population , especially within the poorer communities [ 26 ]	1
17904	@DISEASE$ is surrounded by intense grief , with implications to different spheres of life , including social relationships	1
17905	This is due to long - standing negative representations about this disease , which result in stigma and discrimination	1
17906	Healthcare professionals believe besides @DISEASE$ ' s ability to impact patients ' lives and causes death , it also has strong emotional impact on the life of a patient since it evokes disability , @DISEASE$ , and self - discrimination .	1
17907	The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest .	1
17908	The present paper analyzes 603 consecutive visits for @DISEASE$ exacerbations in our Pediatric ED	1
17909	The proportion of visits for @DISEASE$ that we describe ( 2	1
17910	6 % ) is similar to that reported by Nath and Hsia in 2015 in a United States study ( 2	1
17911	8 % ) [ 9 ]	1
17912	According to what is described by Bekmezian et al	1
17913	[ 10 ] , most patients were males and preschool - aged children	1
17914	" Green " and " yellow " triage priority labels were the most frequently assigned to our patients ; the severity was most often judged as mild or moderate and only in 4 % of the patients as severe	1
17915	Bekmezian et al	1
17916	studied 1249 Pediatric ED visits for moderate - to - severe @DISEASE$ exacerbations and reported that only 1 % of them had a triage priority code " 1 " ( comparable to our " red " ) ; in most cases , a " 2 " or " 3 " code was assigned and , less frequently , a " 4 or 5 " code [ 10 ] .	1
17917	Metabolic products can provide substantial information about the interactions of viruses and infected host cells , and the how immune system responds to infection [ 103 , 104 ]	1
17918	The field of metabolomics is young but potentially informative for understanding hantavirus / reservoir host interactions	1
17919	Many viruses metabolically remodel the host cell to optimize infection	1
17920	Because metabolic products ( e	1
17921	g	1
17922	, carbohydrates , lipids , prostaglandins , etc	1
17923	) are identical or highly similar between vertebrate species , this approach may help identify which @GENE$ , by virtue of their metabolic products , may be targeted by hantaviruses	1
17924	While there are no reports of metabolic assessment of @DISEASE$ infections , @DISEASE$ virus ( RVFV ) modulates the activity of adenosine@GENE$ in@GENE$ cted cells	1
17925	This enzyme is a regulator of several metabolic pathways , including enhancement of catabolic pathways such as autophagy and ATP production , but it represses anabolic pathways , such as lipid biosynthesis	1
17926	Infection of cells by several viruses , including RVFV , results in activation of AMPK and @GENE$ iction of viral replication , suggesting an antiviral role for this enzyme [ 105 ]	1
17927	Other studies have revealed metabolic pathway targeting by viruses [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] , thus efforts to examine how hantaviruses may manipulate the metabolomes of infected cells could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating @DISEASE$ .	1
17928	Detection of @GENE$ in clinical specimens	1
17929	A total of 300 clinical samples was analyzed by the new DAS - LFIA method as described above and the HCV ELISA test kit ( Shanghai Huaguan Biochip Co	1

17938	Two studies on the timing and rate of seasonal influenza transmission across the United States of America ( USA ) highlight the difficulty of using standard epidemiological data to disentangle the relative contributions of different human transportation systems to @DISEASE$ spread	1
17939	Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( P & I ) , Viboud et al	1
17940	[ 9 ] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces , and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation	1
17941	In contrast , Brownstein et al	1
17942	[ 10 ] concluded that the rate of inter - regional spread and timing of @DISEASE$ in the USA , as measured using weekly P & I mortality statistics , is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November	1
17943	These discordant findings generated significant debate [ 11 ] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [ 12 ] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions .	1
17944	Bat research networks and viral surveillance are assumed to be at odds due to seemingly conflicting research priorities	1
17945	Yet human threats that contribute to declines in bat populations globally also lead to increased transmission and spread of @DISEASE$ , which may pose a threat to global health and food security	1
17946	In this review , we discuss the importance of and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations between bat research networks and @DISEASE$ experts to tackle shared threats that jeopardize bat conservation as well as human and animal health	1
17947	Moreover , we assess research effort on bats and bat - associated viruses globally , and demonstrate that Western Asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research	1
17948	The lack of bat research in Western Asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region - specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover	1
17949	We detail a regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia ( i	1
17950	e	1
17951	, the Western Asia Bat Research Network , WAB - Net ) , with the aim of integrating ecological research on bats with virus surveillance to find " win - win " solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region .	1
17952	TBFVs are enveloped viruses around 50 nm in diameter	1
17953	The envelope carries two @GENE$ , the @GENE$ and the @GENE$	1
17954	The latter is derived from a @GENE$ , @GENE$	1
17955	The @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) lies inside the viral envelope and consists of multiple copies of @GENE$ and the @GENE$	1
17956	The @GENE$ are single stranded , @GENE$ of approximately 11 , 000 nucleotides	1
17957	It has a @GENE$ with a single @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
17958	The @GENE$ is flanked by @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
17959	The @GENE$ protein is encoded by the @GENE$ as a @GENE$ , which is co - and post - translationally cleaved by @GENE$ into individual @GENE$ ( three structural and seven non - structural )	1
17960	The @GENE$ is arranged in the order 5 - @GENE$ - @GENE$ [ 70 , 71 ] .	1
17961	Within the human lineage , there was a systematic decline in the Ti / Tv ratio ( Figure 5 )	1
17962	In addition , there was a very consistent loss of codon specificity over time ( Figures 6 and 7 )	1
17963	We show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s , its subsequent re - introduction in 1976 , and an apparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009	1
17964	Strain extinction has often occurred when new strains appeared , including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3 - like strains in 1917 , @GENE$ replacing H1N1 in 1957 , and @GENE$ replacing H2N2 in 1968 [ 5 ]	1
17965	To our knowledge , we are the first to document the replacement of the re - introduced human H1N1 with reassorted swine @GENE$ in 2009	1
17966	All this is consistent with the genetic attenuation hypothesis , and we feel this is the most fundamental explanation for the very smooth , systematic , and exponential decline in H1N1 mortality rates since 1918 [ 2 ] .	1
17967	In conclusion , the data indicate that cellular analysis of BAL fluid , alone or in combination with @GENE$ and @GENE$ concentrations , may rapidly provide valuable diagnostic information for the early differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in critically ill adult patients .	1
17968	The most obvious place to test how reassortment might affect the mutation accumulation curve is with the 2009 - 2010 " @DISEASE$ " outbreak samples	1
17969	Despite the fact that the viral line has been attributed to reassortment with swine viruses , with partial contribution from earlier reassortments between swine and avian strains [ 8 ] , it does not display a jump in mutation count	1
17970	Reassortment can produce novel antigenic variants , but it does not reverse the majority of mutations , for they have accumulated in the non - reassorted areas of the genome .	1
17971	The results described here identify a novel mechanism through which @GENE$ affect HIV - 1 infectivity during the late phases of the viral life cycle	1
17972	Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories , these results indicate that @GENE$ can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle , in target cells as well as in virus - producing cells	1
17973	These results raise the possibility that @GENE$ could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses .	1

17978	A BLASTn search ( Altschul et al	1

17984	The optimum @GENE$ annealing temperature ( T a ) was determined first using a 55 - 65 ° C temperature gradient , and amplicons were assessed also for specificity using a melt curve analysis ( a single melt point was shown within the temperature predicted by the PCR design software )	1
17985	Primer concentrations were varied between 50 and 500 nM , with the primer concentration that gave the lowest crossing point ( C p ) without the appearance of additional peaks in the no - template control ( NTC ) on the melt curve considered optimum .	1

17990	Among the bacterial culture positive patients described in Table 4 , 17	1
17991	5 % ( n = 35 ) had coinfections with viral pathogens .	1
17992	Recent studies of asymptomatic @DISEASE$ cases reported the frequent presence of respiratory pathogens like HRV , adenovirus , S	1
17993	pneumoniae etc	1
17994	In this study , we collected 30 asymptomatic specimens	1
17995	43 % ( n = 13 ) of those asymptomatic children were positive for pathogen ( s )	1
17996	However , the detection rate of pathogens in symptomatic specimens ( 82	1
17997	5 % ) was significantly higher than that of in asymptomatic specimens ( P < 0	1
17998	0001 ) ( Table 5 ) .	1
17999	We report a young girl who died of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ despite prior pneumococcal vaccination , appropriate antibiotics , and aggressive intensive care support	1

18002	The pneumococcus is penicillin sensitive	1
18003	Although infections with each of these pathogens alone are typically mild , this case highlights that co - infection with the triple respiratory pathogens possibly contributed to the fatal outcome of this child	1
18004	Also , the new policy in Hong Kong to use PCV13 may help prevent further cases of @DISEASE$ .	1
18005	it was referred to as human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center ( hCoV - EMC ) [ 5 ]	1
18006	Following that case , another patient from the Middle East with severe @DISEASE$ , who was transferred to the UK , was found to be infected with the same virus	1
18007	On analyzing and comparing the samples from the Jordan outbreak with the latter ones , the same virus hCoV - EMC was recognized as causing this new and severe form of @DISEASE$	1
18008	It was later titled as MERS - CoV [ 6 ]	1
18009	Since its first detection to this date , this virus has spread in countries across Middle East and Europe [ 7 ]	1
18010	The highest number of cases has been identified in Saudi Arabia	1
18011	Infections in European countries have been brought in by travel from the Middle East [ 7 , 8 ]	1
18012	From 2012 through the end of December 2018 , the number of confirmed cases of @DISEASE$ globally reported to the WHO was 2279 with 806 associated deaths , which corresponds to a fatality rate of approximately 35	1
18013	36 %	1
18014	Saudi Arabia was on the top of the list of countries with 1901 reports of confirmed cases , including 732 related deaths with a fatality rate of approximately 39 % [ 9 ]	1
18015	Due to its high mortality rate ( [UNK] 36 % ) [ 9 , 10 ] and pathogenicity , nonavailability of vaccine or any other definite treatment , @DISEASE$ is considered a major challenge to global health and presents a pressing need for the research and development of definite therapeutic options and adequate management to prevent its infection [ 11 , 12 ] .	1
18016	Conclusions : Cellular analysis of BAL fluid can aid early differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ from @DISEASE$ in critically ill patients .	1
18017	In conclusion , among 1 , 610 contacts , only 1 non - healthcare worker who was a patient in a @DISEASE$ - affected hospital had an asymptomatic @DISEASE$	1
18018	To understand new emerging @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , more intensive epidemiologic research is needed , including an analysis of asymptomatic infections .	1
18019	Spleens were harvested on day 8 post prime - boost vaccination	1
18020	Splenocytes were prepared by passing through a 70 µm strainer ( Falcon ® , A Corning Brand , Corning , USA ) and incubating with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer ( SIGMA - ALDRICH , Taufkirchen , Germany )	1
18021	Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium ( SIGMA - ALDRICH ) containing 10 % heat inactivated FBS and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin	1
18022	Splenocytes were further processed by using the QuadroMACS Kit ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) to separate CD8 + and CD4 + splenocytes with MACS Micro Beads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) .	1
18023	One - way ANOVA with the Kruskal - Wallis test was used to compare the results obtained from different groups with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$	1
18024	An unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used to evaluate the statistical differences of the RNA expression levels between the groups	1
18025	The log - rank test was used to evaluate differences in survival	1
18026	A p - value , 0	1
18027	05 was considered statistically significant	1
18028	The symbol * and * * were used to indicate p - values , 0	1
18029	05 and , 0	1
18030	01 , respectively	1
18031	These tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5	1
18032	0 for Windows .	1
18033	In China , the @GENE$ HB@GENE$ seropositive rate for the general population ( between 1 and 59 years of age ) is 7	1
18034	18 % ( 1 )	1
18035	Globally , there are ~ 93 million individuals with @DISEASE$ , 20 million of which are chronic ( 2 )	1
18036	@DISEASE$ is the most common risk factor for @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , and the mortality of @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) may exceed 60 %	1
18037	@DISEASE$ are not easy to cure , and the mechanisms of the virus are unclear , particularly with regard to protein expression and regulation function in the pathogenic process .	1
18038	His illness began abruptly with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , for which he received symptomatic treatment as an outpatient at a private medical centre during the first 2 days after disease - onset	1
18039	On the third day , his condition worsened as he fed poorly and was noted to have reduced activity , with persistence of the @DISEASE$	1
18040	A detailed history was then taken and revealed that the child ' s uncle , who lives with the family and had never received @DISEASE$ vaccination , had been admitted to the same medical centre 2 weeks earlier with a laboratory - confirmed diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
18041	Physical examination of the child revealed @DISEASE$ and he was then admitted to the medical centre	1
18042	Later that day , he developed a typical @DISEASE$ which began behind the ears and neck , and spread to his face and trunk	1
18043	The following day , he was referred to our hospital with a clinical diagnosis of @DISEASE$ .	1
18044	Genome sequences provide valuable resources for characterizing viral evolution and disease epidemiology , and for identifying transmission events and outbreaks , which is not always possible with @GENE$ [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
18045	The increased number of phylogenetically informative @GENE$ obtained from @GENE$ may allow better linking of cases and aid public health interventions in real time during epidemics [ 14 , 15 ]	1
18046	PCR approaches for targeted whole genome sequencing , in contrast to random amplification , can preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental nucleic acids [ 16 , 17 ] potentially focusing sequencing on the virus of interest	1
18047	To date , the largest dataset of HMPV @GENE$ ( n = 61 ) sequenced from any tropical country is from three Peruvian cities , Lima , Piura and Iquitos [ 18 ]	1
18048	In Africa , apart from one @GENE$ identified from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda ( GenBank accession number HM197719 ) , there are no @GENE$ reported according to the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource ( ViPR , http : / / www	1
18049	viprbrc	1
18050	org / , accessed April 30 , 2019 )	1
18051	This has led to limited understanding of the genetic and genomic diversity of HMPV in the continent .	1
18052	The F81 cells were selected because they efficiently support CPV replication and show specific cytopathic effects ( CPEs ) [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ]	1
18053	The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 and analysed between 0 and 60 h post - infection ( hpi )	1
18054	As shown in Fig	1
18055	1a , the mock - infected cells maintained growth without obvious CPEs	1
18056	In contrast , @GENE$ in the infection groups became noticeable at 36 hpi and progressed thereafter , and more than half of the cells had become detached at 60 hpi	1
18057	As shown in Fig	1
18058	1b , the viral titre reached a plateau between 24 hpi and 60 hpi , and then rapidly declined	1
18059	Using the dynamic changes in @GENE$ and viral titre as a guide , time points between 12 hpi and 60 hpi were selected for comprehensive proteomic analysis during which the viral titre remained high while the CPEs progressed in the infected cells .	1
18060	Comparison of @DISEASE$ patients @GENE$ dm09 between the post - pandemic seasons showed that median age was 1	1
18061	7 years in the third season and , thus , significantly lower than in the first season	1
18062	A significant age shift towards younger children , from a median age of 5 to 3 years , had already been observed in a comparison of the pandemic and the first post - pandemic season in Germany [ 20 ]	1
18063	The continued shift towards younger patients in the third season is likely to be due to increasing immunity in the older paediatric population , after previous contact @GENE$ dm09	1
18064	Seroprevalence data from Germany had already shown evidence@GENE$ dm09 infection in as many as 25 % of children aged 1 - 4 years and 48 % of 5 - 17 year - old children for the pandemic season 2009 / 10 [ 26 ]	1
18065	A similar shift towards younger hospitalized children [ 27 , 28 ] and towards younger children with severe paediatric @DISEASE$ from the pandemic season to the first post - pandemic season had also been detected in other European countries [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] .	1
18066	Establishing a successful bat One Health research program in Western Asia will require hands - on , hypothesis - driven research projects that integrate applied bat ecology with disease surveillance	1
18067	International collaborative research is most effective and relevant to policy makers when organized around specific hypotheses and validated with experimental data [ 146 , 147 ]	1
18068	Further , international research is most likely to be successful if the specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local ( in - region ) scientists and stakeholders	1
18069	Toward this aim , @GENE$ - Net is working with key personnel from throughout the region to develop a robust collaborative research program on bats and bat - associated CoVs	1
18070	This multinational research program will use a combination of field , laboratory , and analytical methods to address outstanding questions surrounding drivers of host - virus dynamics .	1
18071	To promote data sharing among its members , WAB - Net has initiated development of a database ( wabnet	1
18072	eha	1
18073	io ) that aims to serve as a multi - use One Health spatial database , storing ecological and viral data , and linking to other @GENE$  ecological , and biodiversity datasets .	1
18074	The H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic @DISEASE$ virus has frequently infected wild and domestic ducks in Asia , causing huge economic damage to both poultry farms and governments in the affected countries	1
18075	Most @DISEASE$ viruses do not infect humans , but the 1997 outbreak of the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong [ 1 , 2 ] alerted the medical community that some subtypes of avian influenza viruses include highly pathogenic strains that can affect humans	1
18076	In this @DISEASE$ outbreak , there were 6 deaths in the 18 human cases caused by the H5N1 subtype [ 3 ]	1
18077	As of August 2 , 2010 , WHO has identified 502 human cases of @DISEASE$ around the world , and 298 of these were fatal [ 4 ]	1
18078	In particular , H5N1 outbreaks have occurred recently in Egypt , Indonesia , and Vietnam	1
18079	Therefore , @DISEASE$ virus can cause serious public health problems in birds and humans and is one of the most infectious @DISEASE$ transmissible to humans .	1
18080	Bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse mammals with over 1300 species distributed globally and serve as a model taxonomic group for ecological and evolutionary research [ 1 ]	1
18081	Yet , population sizes are decreasing ( 22 % ) or unknown ( 57 % ) for a vast majority of bat species [ 2 ] , and there is limited capacity to manage and protect bat populations in much of the world [ 3 , 4 ]	1
18082	Bats are increasingly recognized as important reservoirs for @DISEASE$ , and as a result , research effort on bat - associated viruses and other pathogens has grown dramatically in recent years [ 5 , 6 ]	1
18083	Bats are reservoir hosts for several notable groups of viruses that pose significant threats to human and livestock health , including @DISEASE$ [ 7 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 8 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 9 ]	1
18084	Given the importance of protecting human health and global economies , disease surveillance has been the focus of a large body of bat research over the past 15 years	1
18085	While bat conservation and virus surveillance may appear at odds due to conflicting objectives and research priorities [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] , these two endeavors can be complementary and synergistic , especially if properly linked early on through collaborative research networks	1
18086	Adopting an ecologically - minded One Health approach to proactively identify bat - associated zoonoses and the specific human activities that contribute to increased spillover risk will also contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bat species in understudied regions	1
18087	One Health is the concept that the health of humans , animals , and the environment are inextricably linked , and requires multidisciplinary research and collaboration when put into practice [ 14 ]	1
18088	Inclusion of bat experts in initiatives to monitor bat - associated viruses will enhance our ability to derive and communicate meaningful information about potential risks to human and animal health but also inform intervention measures to reduce opportunities for virus spillover in degraded environments .	1
18089	In this work , we compared two different ways to generate pseudoknot - free input structures for input to Iterative HFold , namely the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by @GENE$ , and @GENE$	1
18090	On the HK - PK and HK - PK - free data sets , accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these	1
18091	An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable @GENE$ , as calculated using the partition function [ 43 ]	1
18092	Even better may be to calculate base pair probabilities for @GENE$ of @GENE$ ; however this requires ( n 5 ) time	1
18093	Since @GENE$ finds minimum free energy structure in O ( n 3 ) time , conditional on the given input structure , we are currently investigating ways to develop an O ( n 3 ) - time partition function version of @GENE$ that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure .	1
18094	A key advantage of the UVC based approach , which is in clear contrast to vaccination approaches , is that UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes	1
18095	For example , while there will almost certainly be variations in UVC inactivation efficiency as different @DISEASE$ strains appear , they are unlikely to be large 7 , 10	1
18096	Likewise , as multi - drug - resistant variants of bacteria emerge , their UVC inactivation efficiencies are also unlikely to change greatly 9 .	1
18097	Different RABV variants are associated with different reservoir hosts and geographical locations	1
18098	Typically , interspecies transmission of @DISEASE$ virus from reservoir to non - reservoir host produces a single fatal spillover event ; secondary transmission has rarely been observed [ 7 ]	1
18099	For example , a bat variant may infect and cause disease in skunks , but it does not transmit efficiently within the skunk population and skunks would be considered a ' ' dead - end host ' ' for this variant	1
18100	The exception to this would be the case of cross - species transmission ( CST ) where the variant from one species adapts to transmission by a new species [ 8 ]	1
18101	For example , in 2001 , bat variant @DISEASE$ adapted to transmission within the skunk population in Flagstaff Arizona [ 9 ] , and in 2009 this variant adapted to transmission by foxes [ 7 ]	1
18102	These events demonstrate the capacity of @DISEASE$ virus for CST which may lead to increased exposure of humans to the pathogen and increase the geographical range of the virus .	1
18103	This assay is convenient for evaluating the effects of antioxidants against slow oxidation phenomena occurring over prolonged periods of time , as shown in the shelf life of foods [ 59 ]	1
18104	The authors [ 43 ] using this method showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris , Eugenia caryophyllus , Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume	1
18105	, Ocimum basilicum L	1
18106	and Illicium verum Hook	1
18107	f	1
18108	were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system , after 40 days of storage	1
18109	The decrease of hexanal was followed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector	1
18110	Such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation , since Illicium verum oil was mainly cosnstituted by anethole [ 43 ] .	1
18111	To validate the significance of @GENE$ during viral infection of mosquitoes , female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
18112	As a control , mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against @GENE$	1
18113	The mosquitoes were infected with @DISEASE$ ( NY99 strain ) by blood - feeding 24 h post - microinjection	1
18114	At 10 days post - infection , saliva from individual mosquitoes was collected in a capillary tube ( see methods ) and total RNA was collected from whole mosquito carcass and midgut	1
18115	As a parallel experiment , mosquitoes were collected at day 2 and day 10 post - infection	1
18116	Western blot was performed on whole mosquito @GENE$  anti - CxSTA@GENE$ odies	1
18117	Results showed increased leve@GENE$ xSTAT by day 2 postinfection	1
18118	The levels decreased to baseline by day 10 post - infection in control mosquit@GENE$ dsRNA ) ; however in mosquitoes@GENE$ xCul4 ds@GENE$  STAT levels remained high ( Fig 5E )	1
18119	Real - time RT - qPCR results showed efficient knock - down ( > 60 %@GENE$  mRNA in carcass after Cul4 dsRNA microinjections ( Fig 6A )	1
18120	The results also showed a decrease ( > 50 %@GENE$ l @GENE$ ( NS1 ) in whole mosquito carcass ( Fig 6B ) and midgut ( Fig 6D ) in CxCul4 dsRNAinjected mosquitoes compared with the control , confirming pro - viral effe@GENE$ xCul4	1
18121	Interestingly , real - time RT - qPCR results also showed a significant increa@GENE$  mRNA expression in carcass ( 3 - fold ) ( Fig 6C ) and midgut ( 5 - fold ) ( Fig 6E ) in CxCul4 - knockdown mosquitoes , indicating increase@GENE$  STAT signaling	1
18122	Plaque assays performed on mosquito saliva showed a significantly lower virus titer in mosquito saliva microinjected@GENE$ dsRNA ( 88 pfu / mosquito ) compared with control ( GFP dsRNA ) ( 429 pfu / mosquito ) ( Fig 6F ) , indicating a lower likelihood of virus transmission by CxCul4 silenced mosquitoes	1
18123	It should be noted that saliva from 3 mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA injection showed higher viral titers ( similar to controls )	1
18124	Further analysis showed that CxCul4 was not efficiently knocked down in these three mosquitoes ( Fig 6A , inset )	1
18125	These results further validate that CxCul4 has a proviral effect by inhibiting Jak - STAT pathway during WNV infection in mosquitoes	1
18126	It should also be noted that ~ 20 - 30 % of mosquitoes from each group did not show any virus in the saliva , possibly indicative of vector competence of these mosquito species .	1
18127	As reported for the DPPH method , there are also some authors that only used the ABTS method for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils [ 75 , 76 ]	1
18128	Ennajar et al	1
18129	( 2010 ) [ 75 ] studied the influence of organ , season and drying method on chemical composition and the ABTS - scavenging ability of Juniperus phoeniceae L	1
18130	. They found the highest and the lowest activities in the same part of the plant ( berries )	1
18131	Considering the drying method used , oven - drying was the best method to obtain an important activity for leaf and berry oils , followed by sun - dried essential oils and shade - dried samples	1
18132	Such variability seemed to be related to the chemical composition of the oils , wich having a similar profile , the main components were present in different proportions ( α - pinene , δ - 3 - carene , α - terpineol , β - myrcene , among other components )	1
18133	Rosa canina L	1
18134	also possessed capacity for scavenging ABTS , nevertheless the harvesting place was determinant in such activity , which seemed to be related to the presence of high percentages of vitispirane [ 76 ] .	1
18135	STAT activation experiments were performed as previously described [ 59 ]	1
18136	The @GENE$ were kindly provided by Prof	1
18137	Martin Zeidler ( University of Sheffield ) [ 60 ]	1
18138	In brief , Hsu cells were transfected with STAT reporter plasmid @GENE$ ( @GENE$ with a @GENE$ ) and a control plasmid , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ under control of the @GENE$ for constitutive expression )	1
18139	Cells were also transfected with dsRNA against @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
18140	Cells were stimulated with heat inactivated E	1
18141	coli , WNV ( MOI = 1 ) or PBS ( Control ) for 1h	1
18142	@GENE$ activity was measured at 16 h post - stimulation	1
18143	Heat - inactivated bacteria were prepared by incubating 1μl of E	1
18144	coli DH5α in 5 ml LB medium at 37 ° C for 16 h	1
18145	Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0	1
18146	5 ml of PBS	1
18147	Heat inactivation was achieved by incubating the cells for 10 min at 90 ° C	1
18148	1 μl of the suspension was used per well .	1
18149	@DISEASE$ , which is caused by infection with the @DISEASE$ ( HCV ) , is a global health problem	1
18150	Using a mouse model of @DISEASE$ , we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus ( rVV ) that encodes an HCV protein	1
18151	We gen@GENE$ ocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a C@GENE$ tching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains	1
18152	The HCV core protein was@GENE$ tently in the liver after polyinosinic acid - polycytidylic acid injection , and these mice showed @DISEASE$ - related pathological findings ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
18153	Immunization with one rVV strain ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins , suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and a@GENE$ athological @DISEAS@GENE$  injection	1
18154	Furthermore , HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T - cell - dependent ma@GENE$ stent with these results , we showed that rVV - N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T - cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2	1
18155	We also demonstrated that the onset of @DISEASE$ in CN2 - 29@GENE$  mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines , ( @DISEASE$ necrosis factor ) TNF - a and ( interleukin ) IL - 6	1
18156	Thus ,@GENE$ el@GENE$ stigat@GENE$ cal processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen	1
18157	In add@GENE$ opose that rVV - N25 could be developed as an effective thera@GENE$ ne .	1
18158	with @GENE$ at 48 h post transfection with @GENE$ ( Figure 1e ) .	1
18159	The contemporaneous re - emergence of @DISEASE$ in geographically distinct settings long considered FPL - free has raised questions as to whether virus - related or other unknown risk factors played a role in the observed @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
18160	Herein , case data and clinical samples from 989 and 113 cats , respectively , were analysed to identify the lineages of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 responsible for the outbreaks of @DISEASE$ in Australia ( 2014 to 2018 ) , the UAE ( 2017 ) and NZ ( 2017 - 2018 ) and evaluate epidemiological factors associated with these outbreaks , including vaccination status .	1
18161	Swab samples were inoculated in transport medium ( TRANS - WABSH , UK ) at the site , and transferred to the laboratory at HTD or stored at 4uC until transfer within 48 hours	1
18162	Samples were inoculated into selective Todd - Hewitt broth ( OXOID , UK ) , containing Streptococcal Selective Reagent ( Oxoid ) and crystal violet [ 8 ] and incubated overnight at 37uC , followed by real - time PCR for detection of S	1
18163	suis serotype 2	1
18164	Positive samples were cultured to retrieve S	1
18165	suis isolates .	1
18166	• There is a line on page 14 which states " substantial reductions have been proposed in the earlier work within the EU funded IAIAQ project "	1
18167	It is not clear what reductions are being referred to here	1
18168	Is it reductions in the burden of disease due to indoor exposures ? Why have reductions been proposed ?	1
18169	• I found some parts of the description of the risk model confusing , in particular towards the bottom of page 7	1
18170	Firstly , the text states that the models are based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease for each exposure and disease	1
18171	Is this simply referring to the calculation described later in the section ( bottom of page 8 ) ? Secondly , the text then states that " national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European indoor concentration estimates for each pollutant "	1
18172	I ' m afraid I could not follow the point being made here	1
18173	Which " European " estimates are being referred to ?	1
18174	On day 0 , all cats underwent a baseline physical examination and blood was submitted for complete blood count , serum chemistry panel , total serum thyroxine concentration ( Total T4 ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ and folate testing	1
18175	Viral screening consisted of @GENE$ by indirect fluorescent antibody and @GENE$ and @GENE$ by ELISA	1
18176	Fecal examination included wet smear and zinc sulfate centrifugation flotation and a feline @DISEASE$ PCR panel to detect Campylobacter coli , Campylobacter jejuni ,@GENE$  , Cryptosporidium spp	1
18177	, FCoV , feline @DISEASE$ , Giardia spp	1
18178	, Salmonella spp	1
18179	, @DISEASE$ gondii , and @DISEASE$ fetus	1
18180	Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any @DISEASE$ that could be associated with the clinical signs of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , including , but not limited to FeLV , FIV , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
18181	Cats were also excluded if they were @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or had a Spec fPL ≥ 5	1

18183	Cats that tested positive for FCoV antibody , C@GENE$ ngens enterotoxin gene , C	1

18185	All diagnostic analyses we@GENE$ ducted at a third party commercial laboratory	1
18186	1 Cats were randomized to be fed one of two commercial veterinary therapeutic dry gastrointestinal formulas , Diet A 2 or Diet B	1
18187	3 No additional foods or treats were permitted	1
18188	All investigators and participants were masked to the identity of the diet	1
18189	Study diets were re - packaged into white bags , sealed , and delivered directly to participating veterinary clinics by plant employees not participating in the study	1
18190	Nutrient analysis ( conducted internally at Iams Analytical Laboratory ) , caloric distribution , and ingredient composition is summarized in Table 1	1
18191	Cats were fed according to each product ' s feeding guidelines to maintain body weight .	1
18192	After PBS perfusion , spinal cords were fixed in 10 % zinc formalin , divided into six sections ( two per cervical , thoracic , and lumbar regions ) prior embedding in paraffin	1
18193	Then , 6 μm cross sections were stained with Luxol fast blue ( LFB ) to visualize @DISEASE$	1
18194	To determine the percentage of @DISEASE$ , LFB - stained sections of all six levels per individual mouse were scanned with an Aperio ScanScope ( Vista , CA , USA ) at 40 × and areas of @DISEASE$ within the white matter tracks were quantify using Aperio software .	1
18195	The open source read mapping software SHRiMP2 , which was shown to have high read mapping sensitivity [ 19 ] was chosen for the tool ' s ability to map as many reads as possible in the face of individual errors within each read [ 20 ]	1
18196	All @GENE$ ds were initially mapped to GenBank rabies reference sequence GI : 260063801	1
18197	This reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames	1
18198	Based on a later observation that this newly sequenc@GENE$ enome could differ by approximately 9 % relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox @DISEASE$ sequence , we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9 % of the control reference sequence , however , no noticeable increase in error rates were observed , suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence	1
18199	The Binomial error model defines the expected n@GENE$ us bases that should occur given the assumed PCR and sequencing error rate for a given number of observed reads , using a preset P - value ( set to 0	1
18200	01 with a Bonferonni correc@GENE$ se calls were made when the number of reads with the rare variant exceeded the expected count threshold [ 17 ]	1
18201	The sequencing data used in this study including reads and the analysis files used to make all base calls is available at NCBI ' s archive BioProject # PRJNA216100 .	1
18202	Nowadays , @DISEASE$ are threatening the life of humans around the world [ 1 ]	1
18203	Almost 4 million deaths due to @DISEASE$ and 1	1
18204	5 million deaths due to @DISEASE$ are reported every year [ 2 ]	1
18205	In the past four decades , airborne transmission of @DISEASE$ within enclosed environment has been widely reported by many epidemiology reports [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]	1
18206	In an airplane cabin , the airflow from front to back of the cabin ( longitudinal ) is minimal due to the ventilation system , which means in - flight transmission of disease contaminants should be confined within two rows of an infected passenger [ 6 , 7 ]	1
18207	One possible cause of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient might be the movements of the walking crew members or passengers along the aisle in the airplane cabin [ 8 ]	1
18208	The walking persons might also get infected when they move close to the infector [ 5 ] .	1
18209	Moreover , effective diagnostic tools are essential for veterinarians to confirm the bacterial etiology of @DISEASE$ and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the identified bacterial strain	1
18210	The laboratory diagnosis is particularly important in @DISEASE$ to avoid the inappropriate use of antimicrobials	1
18211	DNA - based molecular detection methods such multiplex PCR based on the d@GENE$ lence genes are rapidly becoming part of the routine laboratory diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , and these genes are used as a biomarkers of ETEC strain [ 7 , 58 ] .	1
18212	ETEC isolates from pig farms with @DISEASE$ may show a high frequency of resistance to multiple antimicrobials [ 1 , 68 ]	1
18213	Nevertheless , there is no indication that drug resistance enhances the virulence of ETEC , alt@GENE$ genes are sometimes associated with drug resistance genes [ 56 ] .	1
18214	The values of A , U , C , G and C + G were compared with the values of A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , ( G + C ) 3 , respectively	1
18215	An interesting and complex correlation was observed	1
18216	In detail , the ( C + G ) 3 have highly significant correlations with A , U , C , G and C + G , respectively , indicating C + G may reflect interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection	1
18217	However , the A have no correlation with A 3 , G 3 and C 3 , and U have no correlation with A 3 ( Table 4 )	1
18218	Both cases suggested that the nucleotide constraint possibly influence synonymous codon usage of polioviruses	1
18219	In addition , the correlation between the Axis 1 ( calculated by PCA ) and the values of A , C , G , U , A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , ( G + C ) , ( G + C ) 3 of each strain was also analyzed	1
18220	The significant correlation was found between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to some extent excluding @GENE$ 1 and the value of A ( Table 4 )	1
18221	The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among @GENE$ of @DISEASE$ strains was directly related to the base composition	1
18222	Finally , the ENC - plot [ ENC plotted against ( G + C ) 3 % ] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve ( Figure 1 )	1
18223	These imply that the codon bias can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition , in other words , by mutation pressure rather than natural selection	1
18224	Effect of other potential factors on codon usage	1
18225	The procedure was performed as previously described [ 16 ]	1
18226	Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio - Rad protein assay	1
18227	5 μg protein from whole - cell lysates were solubilized in 5 × SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS 10 % polyacrylamide gels	1
18228	Blots were incubated with antibodies against @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the concentrations of 1 : 1 , 000 for 2 h ; @GENE$ in the concentration of 1 : 10000 for 1 h ) at room temperature	1
18229	After washing several times , the blots were followed by incubation with a @GENE$ raised against @GENE$ conjugated to @GENE$ ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; Santa Cruz )	1
18230	The blots were washed , transferred to fresh chemiluminescence solution ( Amersham ) for about 1 - 2 min , and exposed to X - ray film	1
18231	In controls , the @GENE$ were omitted or replaced with a control @GENE$	1
18232	for Western blot and cell growth and gel mobility shift assays .	1

18235	Emerging @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) can cause a significant impact on human - and animal health [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and are often the product of a host shift , where a pathogen jumps from its original host to new species [ 4 ]	1
18236	Prominent examples include severe @DISEASE$ or the still ongoing @DISEASE$ ) pandemic [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
18237	Pathogens and their novel hosts lack a co - evolutionary history , which can lead to drastic effects on host populations [ 6 ]	1
18238	In particular , RNA viruses have a high potential to cross species barriers because of high mutation rates that enable fast adaptive changes [ 7 , 8 ] , which make them prominent among @DISEASE$ [ 9 ]	1
18239	Such RNA viruses have also been suggested to contribute to the recent decline of wild pollinators and losses of managed ones , thereby potentially endangering valuable pollination services [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
18240	Thus , it is not surprising that virus transmission between managed honeybees , Apis mellifera , and wild bees has recently been speculated [ 14 , 15 ] .	1
18241	Infection of epithelial cells with the @DISEASE$ induce slow , but significant , IFN type I and II responses [ 36 ]	1
18242	Macrophages release p@GENE$ nd c@GENE$ uch as I@GENE$  I@GENE$ nd I@GENE$ pon @DISEASE$ infection [ 37 ]	1
18243	Similarly , @DISEASE$ infection in blood monocyte - derived macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the release of che@GENE$  cyt@GENE$ or example , IL @GENE$ L @GENE$ CL@GENE$ CL@GENE$  RAN@GENE$ 7 , 48 ]	1
18244	Infection of activated T cells induces apoptosis via different pathways which may also explain the occurrence of @DISEASE$ [ 52 ]	1
18245	With the present available knowledge , it is difficult to describe the exact pathogenesis of @DISEASE$ , but it seems that viral replication in the macrophages results in extreme cytotoxicity and triggers the induction of pro - inflammatory chemicals which may lead to @DISEASE$ .	1
18246	The antioxidant and anti - inflammatory activities of the essential oils are well documented ; nevertheless their uses can be hampered due to the chemical variability of the oils	1
18247	Several factors including harvesting time of the aromatic plant , climatic and agronomic conditions , vegetative development of the plant , the plant part used , type of extraction used can be considered as responsible for fluctuations in their chemical compositions .	1
18248	Overall , these results indicate that the incorporation of @GENE$ onto HIV - 1 viruses interferes with the ability of viral particles to enter in target cells .	1
18249	The findings of this study revealed that patients continued to default treatment for different reasons , such as experiencing side effects , @DISEASE$ , cultural and religious beliefs , and lack of access to healthcare facilities	1
18250	Some default because they wanted to continue receiving the @DISEASE$ grant	1
18251	The findings of this study concur with those of a study that was done by Herrero et al	1
18252	[ 17 ] , which listed the barriers contributing to poor @DISEASE$ treatment compliance , such as communication difficulties , low literacy level , inadequate knowledge and low awareness of @DISEASE$ disease , patients ' attitudes and beliefs in treatment efficacy , @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , unstable living conditions , negative health provider attitudes , stigma and discrimination , overcrowding , and access to medicine .	1
18253	Anonymity was also ensured in which the participants did not write down their names or any personal identification	1
18254	This allowed the participation to be anonymous	1
18255	The researcher respected the choices and agreements made with the participants	1
18256	The initial agreement was not changed without the knowledge of the participants	1
18257	The participants were not victimized for refusing to participate in the study .	1
18258	However , in mice lacking either CD4 or CD8 T - cells , the pathological changes associated with @DISEASE$ were resolved following rVV - N2@GENE$ tion , and the @DISEASE$ score of rVV - N2@GENE$ treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice ( Figures 4C - E )	1
18259	These results indicated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were not responsible for the rVV - N25 - induced amelioration of histological findings and that other inflammatory cell types may play an as - yet - unidentified role in the resolution of the pathological changes in these mice .	1
18260	To ensure that the binding profile was not biased by the amount of virus used for the incubation step , three doses of 5 , 50 and 100 HAU were used	1
18261	The specificity of the staining was the same from 5 to 100 HAU in the infundibulum and magnum , while non - specific staining was slightly increased at the level of the isthmus and uterus ( Additional file 3 )	1
18262	Nevertheless , irrespective of the amount of virus used , positivity at the level of the epithelia was maintained .	1
18263	It is commonly accepted that @GENE$ plays an important role in retrovirus budding , but its mode of function , particularly in HIV - 1 late replication steps , has been controversially discussed [ 38 , 69 , 70 ]	1
18264	Although some studies suggest that the monoubiquitination of @GENE$ contributes to efficient virus particle release via the @GENE$ required for transport ( @GENE$ ) [ 31 , 71 , 72 ] more recent studies indicate that ubiquitination of @GENE$ can occur independently of the @GENE$ and might be dispensable to drive viral particle release [ 26 , 32 , 34 , 73 , 74 ]	1
18265	Moreover , it was demonstrated that the mutation of the @GENE$ within @GENE$ causes enhanced ubiquitination of @GENE$ due to its prolonged membrane association [ 25 , 26 ]	1
18266	This process has been ascribed to the interaction of @GENE$ with a complex consisting of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and the E3 ligase @GENE$ at the plasma membrane [ 34 ]	1
18267	In addition , it has been shown very recently that the highly conserved @GENE$ and the glutamic acids within @GENE$ can regulate the association of @GENE$ with membranes and thus its entry into the UPS and @GENE$ pathway [ 32 , 33 ]	1
18268	Mutation of these motifs leads to a prolonged membrane association of @GENE$ and thus an enhanced entry into the UPS	1
18269	These observations led us to speculate that in the wt situation certain @GENE$ interact with @GENE$ or other domains of @GENE$ , remove @GENE$ , and thereby regulate its entry into the UPS	1
18270	In this study , we could show that DIs , especially those inhibiting @GENE$ and @GENE$ , enhance the entry of @GENE$ into the UPS and thus into the @GENE$ pathway , indicating that specific @GENE$ play an important role in the regulation of @GENE$ ubiquitination	1
18271	Moreover , @GENE$ processing was impaired upon DI treatment , resulting in a reduced infectivity and replication capacity of HIV - 1 , which can be boosted by combinatory treatment with proteasome inhibitors .	1
18272	In light of these data , we speculate that the proportion of birds with severe histopathological changes in the mucosa of the infundibulum ( 29 % ) on days 4 and 6 pi closely related to the proportion of hens with @DISEASE$ ( 30 % ) on days 18 and 80 pi , suggesting a causal link between the two pathological processes .	1
18273	and Dupays et al	1
18274	( 2015 ) data sets , we also investigated their enrichment in the @GENE$ proximal to our genes of interest	1
18275	Either one or both factors were enriched in 17 out of 21 genes ( Table 4 )	1
18276	Therefore , these @GENE$ could form part of a regulatory network that directs or maintains the identity of the pulmonary myocardium .	1
18277	To identify the genomic intervals harboring genes that mediated variable expression , we performed genome - wide interval mapping and marker regression analyses for each transcript	1
18278	The expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between @DISEASE$ strains ( Table 2 )	1
18279	All transcripts except @GENE$ ( @GENE$ lipin ) had either a suggestive ( LRS	1
18280	10	1

18301	Viral replication often is integrally associated with the cell cycle status of host cells ( Feuer et al	1
18302	, 2002 )	1
18303	To explore the possible benefits of different cell cycle phases for EV - D68 viral replication , we synchronized cells in different phases and then assessed viral replication and virulence	1
18304	First , we assessed the effects of G0 / G1 synchronization by serum deprivation ( Darzynkiewicz et al	1
18305	, 1980 )	1
18306	@DISEASE$ cells were cultured in either serum medium ( control ) or serum - free medium ( G0 / G1 synchronization ) for 24 h	1
18307	Then the cells were infected with the same titer of 0	1
18308	8 MOI of EV - D68 ( Fermon strain ) or were mock - infected for 2 h , and either serum medium or serum - free medium was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1A )	1
18309	As previously reported ( He et al	1
18310	, 2010 ) , serum deprivation induced obvious G0 / G1 arrest as assessed by flow cytometry ( P < 0	1
18311	001 ; Figure 1B )	1
18312	At 2 h post - infection ( viral entry stage )@GENE$ ic RNA levels were not significantly different in the control and serumstarved cells ( Figure 1M ) ; however , at 18 h post infection ( viral replication stage ) 13	1
18313	55 time@GENE$ al RNA was detected in the serum - starved cells than in the control cells ( P < 0	1
18314	01 ; Figure 1C )	1
18315	Furthermore , at 24 h ( viral production stage ) the TCID50 / mL of infectious EV - D68 particles was 348	1
18316	84 times higher for supernatant from G0 / G1 phase - synchronized cells ( 202	1
18317	17 ± 42	1
18318	60 × 10 5 ) than for supernatant from control cells ( 0	1
18319	59 ± 0	1
18320	08 × 10 5 ) ( P < 0	1
18321	01 ; Figure 1D )	1
18322	These results suggest that G0 / G1 - phase arrest does not affect viral entry , but promotes EV - D68 viral replication and production .	1
18323	The published information on the treatment of @DISEASE$ is extremely limited because it is available from only 20 case reports and only some of them were followed up ( Table 7 )	1
18324	Allopurinol is the most frequently used drug followed by meglumine antimoniate , but information is lacking on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of these drugs in cats and also about their safety .	1

18340	The Sapling Server offers access to the underlying integration of @GENE$ data - including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , annotations , subsystems , @GENE$ , and co - occurrence data	1
18341	On the server side , the Sapling Server accesses a database implemented by an entity - relationship data model ( ERDB )	1

18347	In pteropid bats , immunological stress was suggested as a contributing factor in henipavirus shedding [ 41 ]	1
18348	As described earlier , Sohayati et al	1
18349	[ 41 ] suspected that the recrudescence of @DISEASE$ infection was triggered by waning antibody levels and an increased level of stress due to a combination of factors such as confinement in a cage , and physiological and behavioral changes during breeding season .	1
18350	Instead of using the region - based approach of Buckeridge , et al	1
18351	, we use the individual - based infection scheme of Brookmeyer , et al	1
18352	[ 17 ]	1
18353	Although it is known that @DISEASE$ spores can survive for long periods of time in the environment , we consider a small scale scenario	1
18354	Since the population of interest is the individuals attending children ' s emergency departments , we assume an outbreak that affects a fixed number , N say , of children	1
18355	Brookmeyer , et al	1
18356	[ 17 ] define the infection probability of an individual exposed to @DISEASE$ using a competing risk model , modeling the dynamics of spore clearance and germination	1
18357	Let θ represent the hazard rate per unit time ( days , say ) that a spore is cleared from the lung and λ be the rate of germination	1
18358	Suppose that each individual inhales a dose of D spores	1
18359	Then , the probability that at least one spore germinates is called the attack rate ( AR ) and is calculated using a Poisson approximation , as	1
18360	We simulated an outbreak , as previously described , 500 times on 500 individuals using an attack rate of 0	1
18361	5	1
18362	The first day of the outbreak was randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the period December 5th , 2003 to June 22nd , 2004	1
18363	( Making the earliest date later than November 1st , 2003 , guarantees enough data for the filter - based methods to work with a prediction window of m = 28 days )	1
18364	In the absence of other information ( e	1
18365	g	1
18366	, Buckeridge , et al	1
18367	[ 16 ] do not report their probabilities ) we set the ED utilization probabilities to be : P d = 0	1

18369	4 ( weekend entry probability at the prodromal stage ) and P f = 0	1

18382	We performed a retrospective analysis of all the Pediatric ED visits for @DISEASE$ in the past year in our hospital to analyze the differences among age groups in terms of triggering Table 1 : Classification of @DISEASE$ severity according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics [ 8 ]	1

18388	Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17	1
18389	0 software	1
18390	Student ' s t - test or one - way analysis of variance was used to compare the @GENE$ genomic copies	1
18391	A p - value of < 0	1

18393	Transgenic mice that express @GENE$ have been generated to study HCV expression [ 3 , 4 ] ; however , in each of these cases , the relevant transgenes is expressed during embryonic development ; therefore , the transgenic mice become immunotolerant to the transgenic products , and consequently , the adult mice are not useful for investigations of the pathogenesis of @DISEASE$	1
18394	To address this problem , we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transg@GENE$ em involves the Cre / loxP@GENE$ tem and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recomb@GENE$	1
18395	Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV protei@GENE$ ce immune responses [ 5 ] and , therefore , obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on @DISEASE$	1
18396	Therefore , here , we used a Cre / loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression ; with this system , we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins	1
18397	Folgori e@GENE$  ) reported effective vaccination of chimpanzees with an adenoviral vector and plasmid DNA encoding the@GENE$ ctural region@GENE$ ed the liver tissues from @DISEASE$ , which results when whole animals are challenged with virus [ 7 ]	1
18398	However , this vaccine has not yet been shown to be effective against @DISEASE$ .	1
18399	He was treated with oral vitamin A and intra - venous fluids	1
18400	His condition began to improve on day 6 of illness , with a resolution of the @DISEASE$ and improvement in feeding and activity	1
18401	By the 7th day of illness , both the generalized @DISEASE$ as well as the BCG inoculation site @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ appeared to be resolving , leaving some @DISEASE$ ( Fig	1
18402	1c , d )	1
18403	He was then discharged home .	1
18404	Given that the @GENE$ of both SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV were capable of antagonizing @GENE$ production through highly similar Innate immunosuppression by @GENE$ P - Y Lui et al mechanisms , 30 it will be of interest to analyze the sequence and domain architecture of the two proteins	1
18405	Sequence alignment of @GENE$ - CoV and @GENE$ revealed a strikingly high sequence similarity ( 470 % ) and the presence of three @GENE$ at the @GENE$ ( Figure 5A )	1
18406	According to the prediction results , we have initially constructed two truncation mutants for @GENE$ , an @GENE$ and a @GENE$ , and tested their inhibitory capacity in suppressing @GENE$ expression using a @GENE$ reporter assay	1
18407	However , neither exhibited an inhibitory effect ( data not shown ) , possibly due to unstable expression or aberrant localization .	1
18408	Some studies have reported that @GENE$ can inhibit transcytosis [ 9 , 60 , 61 ]	1
18409	One of these studies found that @GENE$ inhibited transcytosis of cell - free virus on HEC - 1 cells , whereas none of 13 @GENE$ did ; in fact , some of the @GENE$ might have increased transcytosis , although by no more than about 50 % [ 61 ]	1
18410	To our knowledge , none of these studies was carried out under the acidic conditions that characterize female genital tract secretions .	1
18411	Several countries in Western Asia face a multitude of economic , political , and security challenges that can hinder wildlife research , and likely contribute to a lack of research effort across the region	1
18412	To highlight the gap in research effort on bats and their associated viruses , including coronaviruses , in Western Asia we conducted a literature review of specific search terms by country in PubMed ( see Figures 3 , 5 and 6 )	1
18413	PubMed is a freely available literature database containing nearly 30 million citations dating from 1948 to 2019 , and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) [ 120 ]	1
18414	We extracted the number of publications per country indexed in PubMed using package rentrez [ 121 ] based on the following combinations of search terms : ( 1 ) ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " [ All Fields ] ) , ( 2 ) ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " [ All Fields ] ) AND ( " virus " OR " viruses " [ All Fields ] ) , and ( 3 ) ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " [ All Fields ] ) AND ( " coronavirus " OR " coronaviruses " [ All Fields ] ) ( Table 1 )	1
18415	Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [ 122 ] and viridis [ 108 ] in R version 3	1

18417	3 [ 109 ] .	1
18418	As expected , Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications returned when searching for bat - associated CoV research in Western Asia ( Table S4 ) , likely because bats are the presumed evolutionary source of the @DISEASE$ , a virus that still infects a large number of people each year in the country due to the transmission from @DISEASE$ camels to humans [ 40 , 43 ]	1
18419	In the absence of many primary studies on CoVs in bats from the region , our PubMed searches would have also identified publications that mention bats in the abstracts and titles , e	1
18420	g	1
18421	, of review papers [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ]	1
18422	Bat - CoV characterization from Saudi Arabia [ 40 ] and Lebanon [ 130 ] are two of the notable studies that reported primary results from on - the - ground virus surveillance efforts	1
18423	More than half of the countries in Western Asia had no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table 1 ) , demonstrating a significant gap for a viral family that can cause severe morbidity in human and domestic animal populations .	1
18424	cOnclUsiOn Results of this study suggest that gastrointestinal therapeutic diets alone can be effective in the management of cats with @DISEASE$ associated with a chronic @DISEASE$	1
18425	Cats that do not respond to dietary therapy require further diagnostics and / or medical therapy to adequately characterize and manage the underlying disease	1
18426	Additionally , cats that do not respond to gastrointestinal formulas may respond to diets formulated with limited novel ingredients or hydrolyzed protein sources .	1
18427	White - eyed honeybee pupae were obtained from sealed worker brood frames of two local @DISEASE$	1
18428	mellifera colonies and then microinjected laterally between the second and third segment of the abdomen with 2 µL of a solution containing DWV [ 52 ]	1
18429	The pupae were then incubated at 34	1
18430	5 • C , ≥ 50 % relative humidity and darkness for seven days [ 53 ] and afterward frozen at − 80 • C	1
18431	The DWV solution was prepared by homogenizing a DWV symptomatic honeybee in PBS and chloroform , followed by centrifugation ( 15800 rcf for 10 min )	1
18432	The supernatant was collected , diluted 1 : 1000 , and frozen at − 80 • C before injection into the pupae [ 52 ]	1
18433	For the injected honeybee pupae used as food and positive controls for the virus detection , the logarithmic mean number of viral copies was 11	1
18434	49 ± 0 .@GENE$ primers showed a ratio of 5	1
18435	88 / 1 for DWV - B to DWV - A , but no DWV - C .	1
18436	@GENE$ sensitivity was assessed by the detection of ten @GENE$ in a background of 100 ng of @GENE$ ( Figure 3 )	1
18437	Since the C value of both species is approximately 1 pg [ 12 ] , this background DNA represents a GMO level of 0	1
18438	01 % for both Tnos and P - 35S assays	1
18439	@GENE$ was used because we did not have any @GENE$ free from RoundUp Ready [UNK]	1
18440	DNA extracted from our 0 % CRM was shown to contain 0	1
18441	002 % GMO [ 13 ]	1
18442	The use of 100 ng of this sample would be equivalent to adding 200 copies of the @GENE$ , considerably more than the experimental input of 10 copies	1
18443	We believe the use of @GENE$ to be a valid substitute since none of the @GENE$ for either assay will be present in non - transgenic soya or oilseed rape .	1
18444	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St	1
18445	Louis , MO , USA )	1
18446	@GENE$ and @GENE$ were purchased from Life Technologies ( Grand Island , NY , USA ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Dallas , TX , USA ) , respectively	1
18447	@GENE$ were purchased from IBL - America ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) .	1
18448	In this study , we report an outbreak of fatal @DISEASE$ among captive Southeast tigers ( Panthera tigris altaica ) in the Zhengzhou Zoo in central China	1
18449	A novel @DISEASE$ strain was successfully isolated from these tigers	1
18450	The tigers had been administered two doses of a vaccine ( Nobivac Tricat , Intervet ) against FPLV at three and four months of age	1
18451	On 6 June 2016 , a 5 - month - old tiger presented with non - specific signs of infection , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
18452	Subsequently , the tiger began to vomit and developed watery to @DISEASE$ later in the course of the disease , and transmitted the disease to nine additional tigers and lions ( all between five to eight months of age ) that were housed in the same or adjacent rooms	1
18453	The animals failed to respond to antibiotic and supportive therapy , and five tigers died less than two days after the onset of @DISEASE$	1
18454	The gross findings at necropsy in the tigers revealed @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ primarily affecting the ileum	1
18455	The intestinal lumen contained a dense pinkish liquid with abundant epithelial debris and fibrin , as well as severe @DISEASE$ with marked turgidity of the wall of the ileum	1
18456	In addition , there was @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ the lungs , diffuse bleeding in the kidneys and bleeding spots and @DISEASE$ foci on the surface of the heart ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .	1
18457	The Bartonella genotypes we identified were paraphyletic and closely related to those from other vampire bat populations , other Neotropical bat species , or bat flies	1
18458	Although BLAST also identified Bartonella spp	1
18459	sequenced from rodents , carnivores , and livestock within our hit selection criteria , these consistently formed separate phylogenetic clades that did not contain bat - or bat fly - derived Bartonella ( Fig 3 )	1
18460	These phylogenetic patterns indicate that Bartonella has commonly shifted between bat host species in the Americas but do not support frequent transmission between bats and other host groups	1
18461	Our BaTS analysis also showed that vampire bat Bartonella sequences clustered by country more than expected by chance	1
18462	However , given that several Bartonella genotypes were present in vampire bats from both Central and South America , we suspect this clustering mostly resulted from variation in locally abundant genotypes rather than true barriers to the spread of @DISEASE$	1
18463	Because vampire bats are largely sedentary and non - migratory [ 45 ] , dispersal of these Bartonella genotypes across large distances is unlikely to be attributable to bat movement alone	1
18464	Bartonella genotypes may also have infected vampire bats over long evolutionary timescales , and thus the biogeography of the pathogen may have followed that of its host	1
18465	Alternatively , Bartonella dispersal by other arthropod vectors ( e	1
18466	g	1
18467	, ticks ) or other bat species that share Bartonella genotypes with vampire bats may be conceivable and could be resolved by further field surveys combined with population genetic analyses of alternative bat host species , arthropod vector species , and Bartonella genotypes .	1
18468	At the monthly level ORs were computed using a logistic regression model with a random intercept applied to the individual data for each month taking the 18 months as a categorical covariate into account in addition to the @DISEASE$ status indicator	1
18469	Due to its small prevalence , @DISEASE$ was not considered as single outcome in these analyses	1
18470	Outcomes at the seasonal level were analysed accordingly with the individual data for each winter season and taking into account the three seasons as a categorical covariate	1
18471	Outcomes at the individual level were analysed using a logistic regression model	1
18472	Results are ORs and 95 % CIs	1
18473	Adjusted ORs are based on including age groups and education as simultaneous categorical covariates	1
18474	Furthermore , in order to study the stability of the @DISEASE$ - RTI association with respect to potential confounders , ORs were adjusted by respective variables	1
18475	Subjects with incomplete covariate data were excluded from multivariate analyses .	1

18482	Sesquiterpenoids dominated the oils	1
18483	Furanodiene and germacrene D predominated in the oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora , whereas furanodienone and curzerenone constituted the major components of the Lindera pulcherrima oil [ 44 ]	1
18484	The oils of Persea gamblei were constituted by β - caryophyllene , γ - gurjunene and β - cubenene	1
18485	Such activities were independent on the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils	1
18486	Mighri et al	1
18487	( 2010 ) [ 45 ] studied the antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Artemisia herbaalba Asso	1
18488	cultivated in Southern Tunisia	1
18489	Diverse methods were used , and one of them was the βbleaching test	1
18490	They found four oil types : β - thujone , α - thujone , thujones ( α + β ) , and 1 , 8cineole / camphor / thujones ( α + β )	1
18491	All of these oils exhibited weak antioxidant abilities for preventing the linoleic acid oxidation	1
18492	The β - thujone - rich oil showed the best inhibition percentage ( 12	1
18493	5 % ) , nevertheless much lower than BHA ( 89	1

18500	Experiments were carried out in 96 - well plates and cells were treated with 100 μL of supernatants or relevant controls immediately prior to inoculation	1
18501	Every second day thereafter , 50 μL culture medium was replaced by the same volume of fresh supernatant	1
18502	At appropriate time points , cells and supernatants were harvested and total nucleic acid was extracted from both the cells and supernatants using the @GENE$ Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit I and @GENE$ Pure LC Instrument ( Roche Diagnostics )	1
18503	Viral replication in supernatants and proviral loads in cells were measured by real - time RT - PCR and real - time PCR respectively , with assays previously described [ 63 ]	1
18504	The time course experiments were conducted with supernatants derived from PBMCs of three cats and the measurements on day 8 post inoculation were carried out with material derived from two additional cats	1
18505	In order to facilitate interpretation of the figures illustrating measurements of @GENE$ loads , 45 cycles - cycle threshold ( Ct ) values were calculated and means of duplicate wells are depicted .	1
18506	Antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet was evaluated [ 52 ] through the thiobarbituric acid reactive species ( TBARS ) test using egg yolk as substrate	1

18513	Terpinen - 4ol , γ - terpinene , cis - sabinene hydrate , linalool and p - cymene predominated .	1
18514	The objective of this study was to screen for antigens of the @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) to establish a new double antibody sandwich - lateral flow immunoassay ( DAS - LFIA ) method for testing the presence of an@GENE$  human serum or plasma	1
18515	A series of different re@GENE$  Escherichia coli cells were constructed , expressed , purified and the new DA@GENE$ rip was developed	1
18516	The sensitivity and specificity of new the DAS - LFIA strip were evaluated by detecting 23 HCV - positive sera , a set of quality control references for anti - HCV detection that contain known amounts of an@GENE$ and 8 HCV - negative sera	1
18517	A total of 300 clinical serum samples was examined by both the new DA@GENE$ rip and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA )	1
18518	Data were analyzed using SPSS 11	1
18519	5 software	1
18520	The sensitivity and specificity of the new DAS - LFIA strip were 100 %	1
18521	The lowest test line of the HCV DAS - LFIA strips was 2 NCU / ml	1
18522	Additionally , the concordance between the new DA@GENE$ rip and ELISA methods was 94	1
18523	33 %	1
18524	In conclusion , our new testing method is rapid , simple , sensitive and specifically detects the presence of an@GENE$  human serum or plasma	1
18525	Therefore , it may be used for monitoring HCV .	1
18526	Moerdyk - Schauwecker et al	1
18527	tackled the reactivation of another DNA virus , the @DISEASE$ virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) [ 86 ]	1
18528	They investigated the antiviral activities of five ( RXR ) 4 XB - conjugated PMOs directed against three HSV -@GENE$ 0 @GENE$ 4 @GENE$ CP27@GENE$ al for HSV - 1 replication	1
18529	The most potent PPMOs designed against ICP0 @GENE$ P27@GENE$ gly inhibited HSV - 1 replication in cell culture by reducing viral protein expression ( Figure 1 )	1
18530	In particular , ICP0 @GENE$ was able to suppress the replication of several HSV - 1 strains , including an acyclovir - resistant strain	1
18531	The authors also tested ICP0 @GENE$ in a mouse model of ocular @DISEASE$	1
18532	Topical application of 10 μg ICP0 PPMO to the eyes of HSV - 1 infected mice inhibited virus replication in mouse eyes and reduced the incidence of @DISEASE$ by 37	1
18533	5 - 50 % , thereby preventing death associated with @DISEASE$	1
18534	To evaluate in vivo PPMO toxicity , the investigators applied 100 μg ICP0 PPMO ( ten times the antiviral dose ) daily to the eyes of uninfected mice	1
18535	No gross or microscopic eye damage , no effect on body weight and temperature and no change of behavior were observed following the seven - day treatment	1
18536	These results strengthen the potential of PPMOs as a treatment for recurring @DISEASE$ from HSV - 1 reactivation .	1
18537	ZIKV challenge studies in IFNAR − / − mice For the ZIKA challenge studies , IFNAR − / − mice ( n = 10 / group ) were immunised once or twice with the ZIKA - prME vaccine or pVax1	1
18538	The mice were challenge with either 1 × 10 6 PFU or 2 × 10 6 PFU ZIKV - PR209 virus on day 15 ( single immunisation group ) or day 21 one week after the second immunisation ( two immunisation groups )	1
18539	Post challenge , the animals were weighed and body temperature was measured daily by a subcutaneously located temperature chip	1
18540	In addition , they were observed for clinical signs of disease twice daily ( @DISEASE$ mobility ; hunched posture ; hind - limb knuckle walking ( partial paralysis ) , @DISEASE$ or both hind limbs ) and blood was drawn for viral load determination	1
18541	The criteria for killing on welfare grounds consisted of 20 % @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ in one or both hind limbs .	1
18542	The potential ability of a single immunisation with the @GENE$ - prME DNA vaccine to protect @GENE$ − / − mice from @DISEASE$ challenge was evaluated	1
18543	Groups of 10 mice were immunised i	1
18544	m	1
18545	with electroporation once with either control plasmid or ZIKV - prME vaccine and challenged 2 weeks later with a total dose of 2 × 10 6 PFU ZIKV - PR209	1
18546	Three weeks post challenge , 100 % of the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals survived , whereas only 10 % of the control animals survived ( Figure 6a )	1
18547	To determine gross histopathological changes , brain tissue was sectioned into 5 μmthick sagittal sections , stained for nuclear structures and counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin ( Figure 6b )	1
18548	The mice were killed at day 7 or 8 post challenge for the analysis of histology and viral load	1
18549	The @DISEASE$ infection caused severe @DISEASE$ in the mice	1
18550	The unvaccinated control ( pVax1 ) mice brain sections showed nuclear fragments within neutrophils ( Figures 6b - i ) ; perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex , lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells of the cerebral cortex ( Figure 6b - ii and iii ) and degenerating neurons within the hippocampus ( Figure 6b - iv )	1
18551	In contrast , the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals presented with normal histopathology in brain tissues ( Figures 6b - v and vi ) supporting that protective responses induced by immunisation with the synthe@GENE$ rME vaccine could limit viral - induced disease in the brain	1
18552	This observation demonstrates the potential for vaccination to protect the brain in this model	1
18553	Consistent with the amelioration of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in vaccinated mice following ZIKV challenge , a significantly lower viral load was noted in the blood ( Figure 6c ) and brain ( Figure 6d ) of the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals compared with viral challenged pVax1 vaccinated animals in the high ( 2 × 10 6 PFU ) dose challenge groups	1
18554	Taken together , these data illustrate that ZI - prME DNA vaccine - mediated immune responses can protect mice against ZIKV challenge .	1

18558	Afterwards 10 µL of this solution were handled as stated in the mass spectrometry of proteininhibitor samples part .	1
18559	The evidence and the diversity of causal explanations of the @DISEASE$ are arguably political	1
18560	There are competing narratives that , if considered , justify different responses	1
18561	These are exemplified in relationship to international human travel , climate change , ecosystem , and socioecology	1
18562	The following is a brief overview of some theories of causation of the @DISEASE$ epidemic .	1
18563	Peptide synthesis and inhibitor testing	1
18564	The peptides used in this study were custom synthesized by AAPPTEC of Louisville , KY using traditional Fmoc solid - phase peptide synthesis 40	1
18565	All of the peptides were purified and characterized by AAPPTEC	1
18566	The peptides used in all of the studies were greater than > 95 % purity as determined by high - performance liquid chromatography	1
18567	Inhibition assays were performed in triplicate in a 100 mM Tris pH 7	1

18571	Values were recorded by Infinite pro plate reader every 2 minutes for 30 minutes with laser parameters set for excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm	1
18572	As the inhibition of APN was competitive , the values for the inhibition constant , K i , were determined from the IC50 using the Cheng - Prusoff equation : K i = IC 50 / ( 1 + [ S ] / Km ) .	1
18573	During a 3 - year period from 29 June 2004 to 30 June 2007 , we collected 2 , 230 nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA ) specimens from equally many cases of @DISEASE$ in 1 , 909 children ( some children were included more than once )	1
18574	These children were , after obtaining informed parental consent , included in a study on zinc as adjuvant therapy for @DISEASE$ ( to be presented elsewhere )	1
18575	All included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days	1
18576	Cases with very severe @DISEASE$ / disease , that is , cough or difficult breathing with @DISEASE$ when calm or any general danger signs ( inability to drink / breastfeed , persistent vomiting , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or unconsciousness ) were not included in the study , but instead referred to a tertiary level hospital after initial treatment	1
18577	Other exclusion criteria are listed in the study profile ( Figure 1 )	1
18578	Children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6 - month follow - up scheme of the clinical trial .	1
18579	Exposures to environmental pollutants are associated with increased mortality and morbidity	1
18580	Traditional risk assessment methods estimate these separately as numbers of cases	1
18581	The results from such incidence - based models are not comparable over different types of health endpoints and to improve comparability of impacts on various types of diseases and including mortality , disability adjusted life years ( DALY ) has been proposed as a common metric [ 22 ]	1

18584	Framework for developing European health - based ventilation guidelines was created in 2010 - 2013 in the EU - funded HEALTHVENT project	1
18585	As a part of the project potential of efficient control policies to reduce the burden of disease caused by indoor exposures was estimated	1
18586	Analysis was based on scenario comparison using a model , which was based on mass - balance framework and changes in ventilation level .	1
18587	In this work , the steady - state airflow pattern in the cabin was used as the initial condition for the transient simulation	1
18588	In steady - state , the cold air comes into the airplane cabin from the supply inlets , flows downward and sideward through the cabin and exits from the outlets located at the bottom of the sidewalls	1
18589	No symmetrical recirculation zone exists , unlike the airflow pattern in the twin - aisle airplane [ 18 , 19 , 22 ]	1
18590	Downward airflow can be found on both sides of the aisle , which is induced by the ventilation system	1
18591	The human thermal plume is not apparent because of the significant downward airflow induced by the ventilation system	1
18592	The heat effects of the human body can influence the temperature distribution in the local area around the human body	1
18593	The influence area of these downward airflow is also larger than that of the respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers , which indicates that the influence of the personal respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers on the airflow field is insignificant comparing with that induced by the ventilation system	1
18594	When the standing person moves along the aisle , the airflow pattern in the airplane is affected by human movement , similar to the results given by previous studies [ 8 , 11 ]	1
18595	Significant downward airflow exists in the wake behind the torso , which enhances the downward movement of the room air induced by the ventilation system	1
18596	Hence human movement can disturb the air distribution in a local region and influence the airflow motion in the airplane cabin	1
18597	More details about the airflow pattern in the airplane cabin , and discussions on the human thermal plume and the effects of human movement on the flow field can be found in the Additional file 1 .	1
18598	In this paper , we use data from the 2010 @GENE$ EASE$ database for Great Britain , provided by the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) via the Animal and Plant Health Agency	1
18599	If multiple animals were moved on the same day from one farm to another , this was treated as one movement ; markets were initially not explicitly included	1
18600	Slaughterhouses were considered as sinks , and therefore movements to slaughterhouses were ignored even when going through a livestock market	1
18601	In total , there were 70 243 farms and 327 markets in our dataset , with 856 454 movements in total	1
18602	A total of 635 016 movements passed through markets , with 47 692 farms using cattle markets at least once during 2010 .	1
18603	Immunoassay of the 300 clinical specimens	1
18604	A total of 300 samples was measured using the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and anti - HCV ELISA immunoassays	1
18605	In these 300 cases , we found that the rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and the ELISA - negative one was 78 % ( 234 / 300 )	1
18606	The rate of anti - HCV @GENE$ - negative but ELISA - positive was 2 % ( 6 / 300 )	1
18607	The rate of the anti - HCV @GENE$ - positive strip but the ELISAnegative one was 3	1

18609	The rate of the @GENE$ and ELISA - positive was 16	1
18610	33 % ( 49 / 300 )	1
18611	The concordance between the ELISA and @GENE$ methods was 94	1

18616	Nurse ( N3 ) said that : " Most of the patients who are admitted in our wards are being transferred from other wards due to their critical conditions	1
18617	When some wards such as medical wards realize that @DISEASE$ patients ' condition has deteriorated , they transfer them to our wards , and by then you will find that they cannot do anything on their own	1
18618	They need us to feed them , bath them and take them to the toilet	1
18619	" Nurse ( N4 ) said : " Myself , I feel like I am putting myself in danger to be honest	1
18620	I am scared to come into contact with those patients because most of them are rude and dangerous	1
18621	"	1
18622	Nurse ( N5 ) indicated that : " our biggest challenge in the wards , is that we only have one nurse who is knowledgeable about @DISEASE$	1
18623	She is the only specialist in the wards ; the rest of us know @DISEASE$ a bit because we read about it and from the experience that we have as nurses , even though some of us have attended workshops but I do not recall having to go for training	1
18624	@DISEASE$ patients undergo different stages and it is important for us to understand them	1
18625	Hmm some of the behaviors that we see in the wards shock us and we do not understand why patients could behave like they are insane	1
18626	"	1
18627	A summary of the 615 quantitatively @GENE$ obtained by method 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1	1
18628	The quantitatively @GENE$ selected at each time point by method 2 are listed in Supplementary Tables S2	1
18629	1 To analyse the potential functions of the significantly @GENE$ at each time point , we then performed a gene ontology enrichment of biological processes using DAVID software for the proteins obtained by method 2	1
18630	Generally , @GENE$ are enriched by David software without fuzzy heuristic clustering	1
18631	So , an overwhelming number of terms were generated , which were too difficult to analyse	1
18632	In order to reduce the redundant terms , we re - analysed them by " Functional Annotation Clustering , " and only the term with the minimum p - value in each cluster was reserved	1
18633	As a result , 60 / 79 , 57 / 77 , 22 / 33 , 119 / 166 , and 91 / 135 of the @GENE$ terms at each time point were removed .	1
18634	Categorical data are reported as numbers and percentages , and continuous data are summarized with the median and range ( i	1
18635	e	1
18636	, the minimum and maximum values ) unless otherwise indicated	1
18637	To compare categorical variables or outcomes , such as the occurrence of infection or in - hospital death , between the IVIG group ( n = 28 patients ) and the control group , which included 29 patients who did not receive IVIG therapy , the chisquared test was used	1
18638	For inter - group comparisons of continuous data , the two - tailed two - sample t test was generally performed	1
18639	If the original data exhibited a lognormal distribution , e	1
18640	g	1
18641	, ICU length of stay ( LOS ) , then raw data were log - transformed prior to analysis with the t test	1
18642	A p value < 0	1
18643	05 was assumed to indicate a statistically significant difference between the groups	1
18644	The data analysis was performed using JMP ® 11	1
18645	0 statistical software ( SAS Institute Inc	1
18646	, Cary , NC , USA ) .	1
18647	Quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR )	1
18648	Total RNA from the astrocyte cultures was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen Inc	1
18649	, Tokyo , Japan )	1
18650	The RT reaction with 100 ng of total RNA was carried out with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit ( ReverTra Ace ; Toyobo Co	1
18651	, Ltd , Osaka , Japan )	1
18652	The expression levels of @GENE$ encoding @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ were evaluated by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) using the Thermal Cycler Dice ( Takara Bio Inc	1
18653	, Tokyo , Japan ) and SYBRII Premix Ex Taq ( Takara Bio Inc	1
18654	) reagents	1
18655	Primers for qRT - PCR are listed in Table 1 .	1

18657	What is the prevalence of @DISEASE$ in endemic regions ?	1
18658	Finally , in order to provide a global perspective of the molecular evolution of @GENE$ , the dataset of 909 sequences of @DISEASE$ viruses rather than H5@GENE$ one has been utilized	1
18659	The objective of this macro level analysis is to signify the fact that this approach may lead to the nearest neighbors of some of the lethal clades which may be kept under observation for further evolution	1
18660	Again , the large dataset was analyzed using the three algorithms ProtPars , NJ and UPGMA	1
18661	The results obtained are shown in the additional files 11 , 12 , and 13	1
18662	As per the core and medium sized datasets , the macro dataset also conforms Distributed ML Workflow Distance - based Parsimony to the clustering of H5@GENE$ ong the spatial lines rather than temporal or host range lines .	1
18663	The sequencing protocol consisted of four steps as follows : ( i ) primer design , ( ii ) preparation of primer mixes , ( iii ) @GENE$ and PCR ( iv ) Illumina sequencing and data analysis .	1
18664	Evidenced - based guidelines for management of infants and children with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) were prepared by an expert panel comprising clinicians and investigators representing community pediatrics , public health , and the pediatric specialties of critical care , emergency medicine , hospital medicine , @DISEASE$ , pulmonology , and surgery [ 5 ]	1
18665	Amoxicillin should be used as first - line therapy for previously healthy , appropriately immunized infants and preschool - aged children with mild to moderate @DISEASE$ suspected to be of bacterial origin	1
18666	Amoxicillin provides appropriate coverage for S	1
18667	pneumoniae , the most prominent invasive bacterial pathogen	1
18668	Macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children ( primarily school - aged children and adolescents ) evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with @DISEASE$ caused by atypical pathogens	1
18669	Laboratory testing for M	1
18670	pneumoniae should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame	1
18671	Ampicillin or penicillin G should be administered to the fully immunized infant or school - aged child admitted to a hospital ward with @DISEASE$ when local epidemiologic data document lack of substantial high - level penicillin resistance for invasive S	1
18672	pneumoniae	1
18673	Empiric therapy with a third - generation parenteral cephalosporin ( ceftriaxone or cefotaxime ) should be prescribed for hospitalized infants and children who are not fully immunized , in regions where local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal strains documents high - level penicillin resistance , or for infants and children with life - threatening infection , including @DISEASE$	1
18674	Empiric combination therapy with a macrolide ( oral or parenteral ) , in addition to a beta - lactam antibiotic , should be prescribed for the hospitalized child for whom @DISEASE$	1
18675	pneumonia and @DISEASE$	1
18676	pneumoniae are significant considerations ; diagnostic testing should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame	1
18677	Accordingly , earlier initiation of antibiotics might have increased the chances of survival in this child .	1
18678	We employ a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct spatiotemporal history and test the contribution of potential predictors of spatial spread	1
18679	The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [ 21 ] into a generalized linear model ( GLM ) , by parameterizing each rate of among - location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors	1
18680	For each predictor j , the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient @GENE$ , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor ( in log space ) , and a @GENE$ d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model	1
18681	We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection ( BSSVS ) [ 22 , 23 ] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor	1
18682	This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre - defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among - location movement while simultaneously	1
18683	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a global public health threat that warrants urgent attention	1
18684	However , the multifaceted nature of @DISEASE$ often complicates the development and implementation of comprehensive policies	1
18685	In this study , we describe the policy context and explore experts ' perspectives on the challenges , facilitators , and strategies for combating @DISEASE$ in Singapore	1
18686	We conducted semi - structured interviews with 21 participants	1
18687	Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed thematically , adopting an interpretative approach	1
18688	Participants reported that the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) has effectively funded @DISEASE$ control programs and research in all public hospitals	1
18689	In addition , a preexisting One Health platform , among MOH , Agri - Food & Veterinary Authority ( restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency and the Animal & Veterinary Service under NParks in April 2019 ) , National Environment Agency , and Singapore ' s National Water Agency , was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore ' s @DISEASE$ strategies	1
18690	Nonetheless , participants highlighted that the success of @DISEASE$ strategies is compounded by various challenges such as surveillance in private clinics , resource constraints at community - level health facilities , sub - optimal public awareness , patchy regulation on antimicrobial use in animals , and environmental contamination	1
18691	This study shows that the process of planning and executing @DISEASE$ policies is complicated even in a well - resourced country such as Singapore	1
18692	It has also highlighted the increasing need to address the social , political , cultural , and behavioral aspects influencing @DISEASE$	1
18693	Ultimately , it will be difficult to design policy interventions that cater for the needs of individuals , families , and the community , unless we understand how all these aspects interact and shape the @DISEASE$ response .	1
18694	In this experiment , 28 layers were challenged in the H9 - group , and 12 birds served as negative controls , in the K - group	1
18695	On days 4 , 6 , 10 and 18 pi , seven and three birds were randomly selected and euthanized in the H9 and K groups , respectively	1
18696	Each of the seven birds in the H9 - group , was necropsied and the oviducts were collected for virological , bacteriological and histological analyses , while for 4 / 7 of these animals a more comprehensive set of tissues was analyzed including , lungs , duodenum , cecal tonsils , spleen , kidney and brain , to evaluate the tissue tropism of the challenge virus	1
18697	All of the birds in this experiment were sampled for tracheal swabs on day 4 pi , to confirm that the challenge had been followed by an infection	1
18698	To evaluate the viral shedding , we randomly selected nine animals in this group and collected tracheal and cloacal swabs on day 2 , 4 and 6 pi .	1
18699	Numerous studies now indicate that polymorphisms in genes encoding the cardiac transcription factors @GENE$ and @GENE$ increase susceptibility to @DISEASE$ ( Huang et al	1
18700	2013 ; Qiu et al	1
18701	2014 ; Wang et al	1
18702	2014 ; Xie et al	1
18703	2013 ) , suggesting the potential involvement of disrupted gene netwo@GENE$ sorder	1
18704	Both factors are required for development of the pulmonary myocardium ( Mommersteeg et al	1
18705	2007 ; Ye et al	1
18706	2015 ) , which is also thought to have a pathological role in @DISEASE$ ( Chen et al	1
18707	1999 )	1
18708	A large body of literature has also been amassed to show that variants in genes regulating calcium handling lead to @DISEASE$ ( Table 6 )	1
18709	However , how the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker activity in @DISEASE$ patients is still unknown	1
18710	Further , the underlying molecular identity of the pulmonary myocardium , including which ion channels and transcription @GENE$ xpre@GENE$ has not been described in detail	1
18711	We have used a systems - genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneousl@GENE$ owledge of their identity , and have attempted to shed light on the relationships between transcriptional regulation , ion / calcium handling , contractile phenotypes , and the gene networks involved	1
18712	By cor@GENE$ tion in gene expression and known @DISEASE$ genotypes in a genome - wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associate@GENE$ ssion of a cardiac gene network in t@GENE$ um .	1
18713	Using a functional RNAi kinase screen , recent study identified @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , two receptor @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) which regulate a number of key cellular functions , as host factors for HCV entry [ 103 ]	1
18714	The results showed that the identified @GENE$ mediated HCV entry by regulating @GENE$ associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion , implying that inhibition of @GENE$ function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of @DISEASE$ .	1
18715	In conclusion , the @GENE$ integration of genomic data now contains over 5 , 000 complete or nearly complete @GENE$ , a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded @GENE$ , and a derived set of @GENE$	1
18716	The client - server code discussed in this article gives users easy programmatic access to the data in the @GENE$	1
18717	It has already been successfully been used for building other applications , such as finding prophages in microbial genomes [ 43 ] , desktop - based @GENE$ annotation and comparison ( manuscript in preparation ) , and real - time annotation of metagenomes ( RTMG , URL : http : / / edwards	1
18718	sdsu	1
18719	edu / rtmg [ 39 ] )	1
18720	We encourage researchers to use this software to retrieve and analyze data from the @GENE$ database and we believe that the underlying implementation of these new servers is efficient enough to address the needs of most users and we will continue providing occasional stand - alone versions of the @GENE$ to users who need more performance or privacy .	1
18721	Programming using the servers	1
18722	The SEED servers provide all necessary network operations in a client package that can be used to access the server functions	1
18723	One uses these like any other Perl package	1
18724	For instance , to find all genomes in the @GENE$ , one does the following :	1
18725	Since virus - infected brood and adults are often expelled from honeybee colonies [ 33 - 36 ] and ants are often seen foraging such bees in apiaries ( personal observations ) , it appears as if ants are very likely to consume @DISEASE$ - infected food	1
18726	However , there are only few studies on virus transmission between honeybees and ants	1
18727	@DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( KBV ) presence plus replication was detected in invasive argentine ants ( Linepithema humile ) as well as presence of @DISEASE$ ( BQCV ) in Linepithema humile and Anoplolepis gracilipes [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ]	1
18728	Further , @DISEASE$ and other honeybee viruses ( BQCV , Israeli @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ) were detected in Camponotus sp	1
18729	ants [ 19 ]	1
18730	Similarly , @DISEASE$ virus seems to be able to replicate in ants Camponotus vagus [ 29 ]	1
18731	So far , no study has yet experimentally addressed the efficacy of foodborne virus transmission between honeybees and predators / scavengers	1
18732	Since ants are ubiquitous and play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] , virus transmission from managed honeybees might pose a considerable threat , given the virus is able to exploit the novel hosts	1
18733	On the other hand , viruses and other pathogens may help limiting the spread of invasive @DISEASE$	1
18734	rubra populations [ 37 , 44 ]	1
18735	Novel hosts can be biological vectors that support virus replication or reservoirs and mechanical vectors without virus replication [ 4 ]	1
18736	Further , spillover events can also be bidirectional , from the novel host back to the initial host [ 1 ] , possibly resulting in altered virulence and respective consequences as e	1
18737	g	1
18738	, for @DISEASE$ [ 45 ] .	1
18739	There are some similarities in the shapes of the three quantiles presented in Figures 4 and 5	1
18740	Namely , the filtered signals increase over the first week , and then slowly decrease	1
18741	The spikes in the distributions of the original signal are preserved for the 1 - day filter , smoothed out for the @GENE$ , and partial smoothed over for the linear and exponential filters	1
18742	Smoothing out the spikes tends to lead more sustained peaks ( i	1
18743	e	1
18744	, wider periods of higher sensitivity )	1
18745	The power of detection is smaller for the 1 - day and 7 - day than the linear and the exponential ( as witnessed by smaller maximum heights in each of these stwo curves )	1
18746	For all filters , a drop below zero occurs immediately after the peaks ; the counts go slowly back to zero	1
18747	Periods for which the filtered signals are below zero inhibit detection and thus can mislead the prediction of the end of the outbreak signature .	1
18748	In terms of sensitivity , except for Chicago , Model 3 tended to outperform Model 2 for all filters in the cities we studied	1
18749	This is counter - intuitive , as we would expect that a model that includes the significant ARMA @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) should outperform one that did not contain any @GENE$ series components ( Model 3 )	1
18750	In practice there is a tradeoff between estimation and prediction	1
18751	Table 4 displays the Akaike information criterions ( AICs ) for the four models , fit to the training data of the five EDs	1
18752	For each ED , a smaller AIC denotes a model that better fits the data	1
18753	Model 3 performed better than Model 2 in one - step - ahead predictions ( Figure 9 ) , but Model 2 better explains the training data than Model 3 ( Table 4 ) .	1
18754	An initial assessment of the ability of the assays to be multiplexed was carried out by comparing C p values obtained with the same @GENE$ but with primers used in uniplex , duplex and triplex reactions	1
18755	A mixture of previously identified positive samples was used to create a @GENE$ that was positive for the IC and both of the @GENE$	1
18756	Multiplex qPCRs were run as 20 μl final reaction volumes that contained 4 μl 5 × QuantiTect ® virus Master Mix ( Qiagen , Manchester , UK ) , appropriate amounts of each primer and probe ( Table 1 ) and ca	1
18757	50 ng @GENE$	1
18758	Thermal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95 ° C , followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 ° C and 75 s at 60 C	1
18759	PCR efficiencies of reliable multiplex qPCRs were assessed using serial dilution of standards ( 10 7 - 10 2 copies and 5 7 - 5 2 copies ) with five reactions per dilution	1
18760	As neither virus is readily isolated in cell culture , we modified the qPCR protocol of O ' Callaghan and Fenech ( 2011 ) to quantify the amount of @GENE$	1
18761	Briefly , known quantities of synthetic oligonucleotides ( Eurofins MWG Operon , Edersberg , Germany , or Integrated DNA Technologies , Leuven , Belgium ) ( see Online Resource S2 ) for calculations to determine number of copies based on molecular weight of the oligonucleotides ) , whose @GENE$ are those of the control and @GENE$ that binds the probe , are used to create a standard curve against which the amount of @GENE$ in the unknown samples can be calculated ( O ' Callaghan and Fenech 2011 )	1
18762	With no gold standard assay for either target and therefore no confidence about a ' truly negative ' sample , @GENE$ ( Fisher Scientific , Loughborough , UK ) was added to the serial dilutions to ensure the same quantity of DNA overall in each qPCR ( Online Resource S3 )	1
18763	Only multiplex qPCRs with efficiencies between 90 and 110 % for all assays were retained .	1
18764	Conclusion : Respiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40 % of @DISEASE$ cases in our study	1
18765	The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV , InfA , and PIV3	1
18766	RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed @DISEASE$ epidemics	1
18767	The occurrence of @DISEASE$ in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro - epidemics with several @DISEASE$ , highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures .	1
18768	In arthropods , such as mosquitos and ticks , RNA interferences ( RNAi ) are the most important antiviral defense and tick cells have been shown to mount RNAi responses against LGTV and TBEV [ 93 ]	1
18769	Proteins involved in the @GENE$ mediated response such as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were subsequently identified as inhibitors of LGTV [ 93 ]	1
18770	Furthermore RNA - seq and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that when challenged by @DISEASE$ infection , tick cells upregulated genes involved in immunity and metabolism , whereas genes involved in cellular stress were downregulated [ 94 ]	1
18771	Using gene silencing approaches , this study confirmed the antiviral effec@GENE$ o 30@GENE$ r 90 in tick cells	1
18772	Furthermore , n@GENE$ enes suc@GENE$ or@GENE$ d 90@GENE$ psin was found to inhibit LGTV in tick cells [ 94 ]	1
18773	Taken together , studies so far have identified activation and antiviral actions of the RNAi mediated response in tick cells as well as o@GENE$ eins suc@GENE$ SP@GENE$ SP90 ,@GENE$ psin .	1
18774	It is our contention that all human @DISEASE$ strains undergo natural attenuation due to mutation accumulation	1
18775	It is too early to tell if the remaining versions of the 2009 - 2010 outbreak viruses will do the same , but it is likely given the known history of change in the various @GENE$ .	1
18776	A strength of the current study is the relatively strict enrollment criteria used	1
18777	To minimize bias associated with antimicrobial therapy , all patients who received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours were excluded , regardless of the adequacy of prior antimicrobial therapy	1
18778	By using strict enrollment criteria , however , only a small proportion of @DISEASE$ patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL was finally included ( Figure 1 ) , which might have influenced on the results	1
18779	However , positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio , which are not influenced by disease prevalence , were good , which supports the validity of the data	1
18780	In clinical practice , the results might be applied to patients who have received antimicrobial therapy more than 24 hours	1
18781	That is , if BAL fluid cellular analysis shows evident @DISEASE$ even after antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours , it would be a strong suggestion for bacterial etiology .	1
18782	Our data show that the lineage re - introduced in 1976 was the only significant human H1N1 strain from 1976 until 2009	1
18783	The mutation count trajectory of the H1N1 lineage The data in Figure 3 can be used to estimate the time of arrival into the human population of the first H1N1 virus	1
18784	Extrapolating total mutation count linearly backwards to zero yields a year of first introduction into the human population of approximately 1893	1
18785	Interestingly , this would be in time to explain the 1889 - 1890 " Russian " flu outbreak , which has been considered by some to possibly be the first H1N1 outbreak ( no sequence or serotype data are available for that event )	1
18786	While our data strongly suggest that the ancestral genotype for all human and porcine @DISEASE$ strains ( and by extension , all human influenza strains ) , entered the human population as early as the 1890s , others have estimated the arrival date to be one or more decades later [ 5 ]	1
18787	Our data strongly confirm that all human H1N1 viruses derive from a single , very recent common ancestor , just as others have concluded prior to this study [ 1 ]	1
18788	Given an estimated arrival date of 1893 , we infer that , by 1918 , H1N1 would have accumulated roughly 375 ( 25 years × 15 mutations / year ) mutations since the initial genotype invaded the human population	1
18789	This depends , of course , on the exact arrival date .	1
18790	Background : In 2014 , an outbreak of @DISEASE$ occurred in the Korean military training center	1
18791	However , there are limited data on the characteristics of the @DISEASE$ and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
18792	Methods : The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of @DISEASE$ between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed	1
18793	The patients were divided into three groups , namely , the adenovirus - positive ( Adv ) group , the adenovirus - negative ( Non - Adv ) group and the unknown pathogen group , according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens	1
18794	We evaluated and compared the demographics , clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups	1
18795	Results : Out of the 251 military personnel with @DISEASE$ during the study periods , 67 were classified into the Adv group , while 134 were classified into the Non - Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group	1
18796	The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of @DISEASE$ after admission ( 3	1

18852	Furthermore , no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups , and no patient died in either group	1
18853	Conclusion : In this study , Adv - positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment .	1
18854	For large enough m , since { E k , t } is approximately a white noise process , { D k , t } is approximately a moving average process of order L - 1 with coefficients θ 0 = 1 , θ j = a j - 1 / a 0 for j = 1 ,	1

18862	On the other hand , the rates of coinfections of predominantly detected respiratory viral pathogens including HRV , RSV , HMPV , HPIV - 3 , HBoV , and adenovirus were 63	1

18865	In two cases , up to four pathogens were detected in each specimen	1
18866	Interestingly , coinfection partners of adenovirus were mostly confined to viruses including 5 RSV , 4 HRV , 3HPIV - 3 , 1 influenza A , 1 HMPV , 1 HBoV , whereas there was only one co - detection of bacterial isolates ( E	1

18869	Although major HPIV - 3 coinfection partners included HRV , RSV , adenovirus , S	1
18870	pneumoniae and K	1
18871	pneumoniae , one HPIV - 1 case was co - detected with RSV and HBoV	1
18872	On the other hand , 5 out of 11 HMPV coinfection partners included bacteria like S	1
18873	pneumoniae ( two ) , K	1
18874	pneumoniae ( one ) , and one Streptococcus species as well as viral pathogens including HRV ( five ) , HPIV - 3 , HBoV and adenovirus .	1
18875	In Fig 1 , we observed seasonal variation in terms of specimen collection rates but not the actual pathogen detection rates	1
18876	Therefore , it is important to know true seasonality for each of the individual viral and bacterial pathogens	1
18877	As we can see in Fig 4A , HRV reached its highest peak ( n = 15 ) in September and 2 nd highest peak in November ( n = 10 )	1
18878	In addition , there were six HRV positive specimens in October	1
18879	From January to August , HRV circulation was roughly constant , indicating HRV transmission throughout the year	1
18880	Similar to HRV , the number of @DISEASE$ - infected patients reached its peak in September , when 41 ( 66 % ) of 62 patients were hospitalized	1
18881	On the other hand , the hospitalization rates of @DISEASE$ patients were 26 % ( n = 16 ) , 4	1
18882	8 % ( n = 3 ) , 1	1
18883	6 % ( n = 1 ) , and 1	1
18884	6 % ( n = 1 ) in August , October , November , and December , respectively , whereas there were no detections of @DISEASE$ - infected patients in other months	1
18885	These findings suggest that @DISEASE$ circulation was highly confined in August and September	1
18886	In contrast to @DISEASE$ , HMPV circulation reached its peak ( 50 % , n = 13 ) in January , followed by 23 % ( n = 6 ) , 19 % ( n = 5 ) , and 8 % circulation in February , December , and September	1
18887	There were no enrollments of @DISEASE$ - infected patients in other months	1
18888	After HRV , RSV , and HMPV , HBoV had the fourth highest detection rates in terms of numbers of HBoV - infected patients and all of them were detected between September and March	1
18889	HPIV - 3 showed 2 peaks - 1 in September and another in November , each representing 6 patients , indicating hospitalization of 56 % ( n = 12 ) of HPIV - 3 - infected patients in these 2 months	1
18890	The rest 9 of 21 HPIV - 3 patients were hospitalized in August , October , December , January , and February with hospitalization rates of 10 % ( n = 2 ) , 14 % ( n = 3 ) , 5 % ( n = 1 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , and 5 % ( n = 1 ) , respectively	1
18891	On the other hand , hospitalization rates of adenovirusinfected patients were 36 % ( n = 5 ) , 21 % ( n = 3 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , 5 % ( n = 1 ) , 10 % ( n = 2 ) , and 5 % ( n = 1 ) in August , November , January , February , April , and June , respectively	1
18892	Other viruses of the viral panel including HPIV - 1 , HPIV - 2 , influenza A , and influenza B appeared in small numbers of patients and were not informative for determination of seasonality	1
18893	Next , we analyzed seasonality of ARI - causing bacterial pathogens	1
18894	Fig 4B demonstrates that the most prevalent bacterial pathogen S	1
18895	pneumoniae started appearing in August with four patients and the Acute respiratory infections in under - 5 children in Dhaka number of infected patients reached its peak in September , showing hospitalization of 9 ( 50 % ) out of 18 patients	1
18896	There was only one patient enrolled in each of the months of October , November , December , January , and February for S	1
18897	pneumoniae - associated hospitalization	1
18898	On the other hand , the number of second most prevalent bacterial pathogen K	1
18899	pneumoniae showed its peak circulation in September , as manifested by 5 cases ( 46 % ) of K	1
18900	pneumoniaeassociated hospitalization in this month , followed by 3 ( 27 % ) , 1 ( 9 % ) , and 2 ( 18 % ) hospitalized cases in October , November , and January	1
18901	Like S	1
18902	pneumoniae and K	1
18903	pneumoniae , Streptococcus species had a peak circulation in September with 4 ( 40 % ) hospitalized patients .	1
18904	Few studies have assessed the etiology of @DISEASE$ in sub - Saharan Africa	1
18905	Howie et al	1
18906	recently investigated @DISEASE$ etiology in children in Gambia , observing that S	1
18907	pneumoniae was the leading cause with a high rate of microbial agent co - detection [ 15 ]	1
18908	Conversely , they found that @DISEASE$ was not predominant whereas we observed that 3 viruses , namely human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus , were associated with @DISEASE$ in Mali	1
18909	Major differences between the 2 studies were sample type ( lung aspirates vs	1
18910	nasal swabs in our investigation ) and the lack of a comparative group in the study by Howie et al	1
18911	which did not permit comparison of microbial prevalence in @DISEASE$ patients and healthy subjects [ 15 ]	1
18912	In a Western Kenya case - control study , S	1
18913	pneumoniae , RSV , and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of @DISEASE$ in children [ 16 ]	1
18914	We noted almost similar results in Mali	1
18915	Thus , S	1
18916	pneumoniae and RSV could still be considered as the primary causes of @DISEASE$ in several sub - Sharan African countries	1
18917	All patients who died had severe @DISEASE$ , according to WHO criteria , with significant @DISEASE$ , very marked @DISEASE$ and severe @DISEASE$	1
18918	Two patients had confirmed @DISEASE$	1
18919	Two patients had @DISEASE$ linked with @DISEASE$	1
18920	In 2 cases , death occurred within 24 hours of admission	1
18921	Despite active treatment with antibiotics and oxygen , the management of severe @DISEASE$ is often difficult in this context because the hospital does not have assisted ventilatory support	1
18922	Mortality was higher than in a recent birth cohort in South Africa [ 17 ] , but was similar to what was reported previously in other developing countries [ 18 , 19 ] .	1
18923	Median white blood cell count was 15 , 750 [UNK] 10 9 cells / l ( IQR : 10 , 000 - 25 , 700 , mean : 20 , 600 [UNK] 10 9 cells / l ) , and median neutrophil percentage was 52	1
18924	5 % ( IQR : 31 - 68 , mean : 50	1
18925	3 % )	1
18926	X - rays showed generalized , dense , homogeneous opacification in 24 ( 20	1
18927	3 % ) patients , @DISEASE$ in 24 ( 20	1
18928	5 % ) , and @DISEASE$ in 65 ( 55	1
18929	1 % ) , without significant differences according to the pattern of infection ( viral , bacterial or mixed )	1
18930	No patient had @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , but 4 ( 3	1
18931	4 % ) had @DISEASE$ .	1
18932	In total , 76 ( 13	1
18933	8 % ) of 552 @DISEASE$ patients were positive for HAdV , and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20	1
18934	1 % ( n = 52 ) and 8	1
18935	2 % ( n = 24 ) , respectively	1
18936	HAdV co - infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent ( infection rates : Northern China , 90	1
18937	4 % ; Eastern China , 70	1
18938	8 % )	1
18939	The peak seasons for HAdV - B infection was winter and spring	1
18940	Additionally , members of multiple speci@GENE$  , D@GENE$  ONE |	1
18941	Tests for positive selection @GENE$ were aligned in Geneious [ 63 ] and alignments were edited to remove gaps and ambiguities	1
18942	Maximum likelihood ( ML ) tests were performed with codeml in the PAML software suite [ 40 ]	1
18943	Aligned sequences were subjected to ML tests using @GENE$ models disallowing ( M8a ) or allowing ( M8 ) positive selection	1
18944	The p - value reported is the result of a chi - squared test on twice the difference of the likelihood values between the two models using one degree of freedom	1
18945	All analyses were consistent when performed with varying models of codon frequency ( F61 and F364 ) and varied starting omega values ( 0	1

18947	5 )	1
18948	Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0	1
18949	95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes ( BEB ) analysis in PAML and the F364 @GENE$ frequency model	1
18950	A second set of maximum likelihood tests was performed using PARRIS in the HyPhy software suite [ 41 ] , which also compares models disallowing or allowing positive selection	1
18951	We report twice the difference in the log likelihood values ( LRT ) , and a p - value based on that difference	1
18952	Signatures of episodic positive selection were calculated in two ways	1
18953	Overall dN / dS ratios for each branch of the phylogenetic tree were calculated using the free ratio model in PAML	1
18954	A branch - site test ( Branchsite REL [ 42 ] ) for statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection was performed using the HyPhy software suite [ 41 ] .	1
18955	The exact antiviral consequences of @GENE$ action , and their cellular context , still remain unclear	1
18956	However , recent studies on @GENE$ implicate two candidate cellular processes	1
18957	First , several @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) have been shown to be important for nucleation of stress granules in the cytoplasm , with ADP - ribosylation modulating @GENE$ activities [ 14 , 29 ]	1
18958	This suggests that ADP - ribose in stress granules , or the @GENE$ functions that are altered by ADPribosylation , are targets for arms races with viruses	1
18959	Stress granules have been shown to have antiviral properties stemming from mRNA sequestration , degradation and translational repression [ 60 ]	1
18960	In contrast , several viruses localize to stress granules and employ them for replication [ 60 ]	1
18961	Our model suggests that @GENE$ may be evolving to either combat the hijacking of stress granules or @GENE$ by viruses , or as direct mediators of the antiviral functions of stress granules or @GENE$	1
18962	Alternatively , @GENE$ may act at the level of gene expression , where ADP - ribosylation and @GENE$ may influence @GENE$	1
18963	Indeed , after the initial discovery that @GENE$ was highly expressed in aggressive @DISEASE$ [ 61 ] , PARP9 @GENE$  wer@GENE$ hown to regulate expression of several immuni@GENE$  62 ]	1
18964	Thus , one possible explanation for positive selection in the macro @GENE$ t viral antagonists target them to prevent transcription of antivi@GENE$  viral antagonism could not only inform us of the role for macro @GENE$  cells , but could also be used as a guide to devise useful interventions for treatment of the aggressive @DISEASE$ that are associated with high PARP9 @GENE$ sion	1
18965	Whether macro @GENE$ erating in stress granules or for antiviral transcription , or in both processes , our model suggest that host m@GENE$ ADP - ribosylation , play a critical role in formation of antivi@GENE$ eas viruses actively target these complexes for antagonism .	1
18966	To identify key factors in the seasonal dispersal of human @DISEASE$ viruses , we use a Bayesian model selection procedure to estimate the phylogeographic history of H3N2 viruses sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007 ( Text S1 ) , while concurrently evaluating the contribution of several potential predictors of spatial spread	1
18967	In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data , we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter - community connectivity ( Methods )	1
18968	Although this approach is blind to the airports ' geographic locations , the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions ( Fig	1
18969	1 )	1
18970	We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania , China , Japan , Sub - Saharan Africa , Mexico and Canada	1
18971	Madagascar , Réunion and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are , as non - European locations , connected to a @GENE$ .	1
18972	To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to analyze the characteristics of @DISEASE$ and response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adult patients with @DISEASE$	1
18973	Patients in the Adv group had some clinical characteristics that were significantly different from those in the Non - Adv group , including a longer duration of @DISEASE$ , a high fever ( over 39 ° C ) , and a higher proportion of no response to antipyretic treatment at admission .	1
18974	Owing to relatively poor efficacy and high adverse effect , most experts now delay antiviral therapy till a histological evidence of recurrent @DISEASE$ is established after LT	1
18975	However , for patients diagnosed with @DISEASE$ , antiviral therapy must be given as early as possible after LT because of the poor short - term prognosis and rapid @DISEASE$ progression	1
18976	Initially , conventional IFN - based therapy was u@GENE$ to treat recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
18977	A systematic review , consisted of 27 studies with a total of 689 patients , demonstrated a mean SVR rate of 24 % with conventional IFN - based therapy [ 70 ]	1
18978	@GENE$ ared to conventional IFN - based therapy , pegylated IFNbased therapy showed a significant improvement of SVR rate	1
18979	Three recent systematic reviews demonstrated 20 - 40 % of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50 - 100 % in genotype 2 / 3 subjects using Pegylated IFN - based therapy for recur@GENE$  @DISEASE$ after LT [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]	1
18980	The same result is also found in the histological improvement , regardless of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$	1
18981	The factors to predict a better SVR are also the same as in nontransplant patients	1
18982	Genotype non - 1 , low pretreatment HCV RNA , rapid virological response ,@GENE$ erence to therapy have been identified as the positive predictors [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]	1
18983	The association between response and recipient / donor liver IL - 28B genot@GENE$	1
18984	Charlton [ 26 ]	1
18985	@DISEASE$ is another poor predictor , and it is almost incurable with IFN treatment when @DISEASE$ develops [ 75 ]	1
18986	Safety and to@GENE$ nce for therapy are also among the major concern in @DISEASE$ recipients with @DISEASE$ recurrence	1
18987	Dose reduction , discontinuation , and acute rejection were noted in 44 % ( 38 - 50 % ) , 24 % ( 21 - 27 % ) , and 2 % ( 1 - 3 % ) of patients treated with conventional IFNbased therapy [ 70 ]	1
18988	For the patients treated with Pegylated IFN@GENE$ , a better SVR rate was noted in comparison to the IFN - @GENE$ d group	1
18989	Meanwhile , the rejection rate was also found to be elevated with a mean rate of 5 - 10 % ( highest 25 % )	1
18990	In addition , dose reduction was noted in over 50 % of patients , and treatment discontinuation was found in around 30 % of patients [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] .	1
18991	Introduction @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , in particular , @DISEASE$ , remain the persistent and pervasive deterrent to public health	1
18992	It is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide , especially in children < 5 years of age	1
18993	But the death rate due to @DISEASE$ is mostly concentrated in developing regions like Africa and Southeast Asia	1
18994	The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that @DISEASE$ account for 1	1
18995	9 to 2	1
18996	2 million childhood deaths annually , with 70 % occurring in Africa and Southeast Asia [ 1 , 2 ]	1
18997	The definition of @DISEASE$ includes all @DISEASE$	1
18998	However , a majority of respiratory deaths are attributed to @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
18999	The incidence of @DISEASE$ in children aged less than 5 years is estimated to be 0	1
19000	22 episodes per childyear , with most cases occurring in India , China , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Indonesia and Nigeria [ 3 , 4 ] .	1
19001	Here we use a model - based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data	1
19002	This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread	1
19003	We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of @DISEASE$	1
19004	Analysis of different sampling schemes , including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation , provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections	1
19005	Using epidemiological simulations , we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of @DISEASE$ in 2009 .	1
19006	Infection triggers a cascading host response that is highly orchestrated by the vertebrate immune system	1
19007	Many genes are modulated ( expressed or repressed ) during the course of infection and identification of @GENE$ and @GENE$ can be used to identify the mechanisms that control , or fail to control , disease	1
19008	Moreover , some @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ , have substantial immunopathologic components	1
19009	The quantitative assessment of the transcriptional landscape ( patterns of gene expression ) can be used to profile the host responses in infected and uninfected animals of the same species , or a disease model species to reservoir host species to identify mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance	1
19010	RNA - Seq is one su@GENE$ ethod for profiling transcriptional landscapes [ 89 ]	1
19011	The depth of coverage and costs of RNA - Seq have impr@GENE$ tically in the last few years , and it is likely to become less expensive	1
19012	However , the computational resources necessary for using RNA - Seq for study@GENE$ esponses is substantial , often requiring hundreds of gigabytes of RAM and multicore , multiprocessor systems typically found in servers running a Linux operating system [ 90 ]	1
19013	This depth is often necessary to detect RNAs that occur in @GENE$ mely low abundance because their proteins are highly potent ( e	1
19014	g	1
19015	, cytokines )	1
19016	Even @GENE$ is possible that differentially expressed genes may not be detected and other , more sensitive methods , such as real - time PCR , may be required to validate pathway signatures	1
19017	Despite these requirements , bioinformatics tools for RNA - Seq are now w@GENE$ lable , many of which are free	1
19018	A typical first step of differential gene expression profiling is the de novo assembly of all RNA - Seq samples f@GENE$ eriment , which represents the totality of expressed genes from the experiment	1
19019	There are several de novo assemblers available , including the Trinity suite [ 90 ] and Oases [ 91 ]	1
19020	Each of these packages has advantages and disadvantages , thus it is important to understand how each performs assemblies , particularly isoforms that may have specific activities	1
19021	Included in the Trinity package is RSEM [ 92 ] that es@GENE$ es transcript abundances , including isoforms , in experimental samples by counting reads from replicates against the de novo assembly	1
19022	An important feature of RSEM is that it doe@GENE$  require an annotated genome ; @GENE$  abundance of transcripts from the unannotated assembly , identifies differentially expressed transcripts , and provides a 95 % credibility interval for each gene	1
19023	Additional tools , such as DESeq and edgeR [ 93 , 94 ] provide statistical evaluation of differential gene expression between samples and provide quantitative ( higher / lower ) and qualitative ( on / off ) data	1
19024	The differentially expressed transcripts are subsequently identified by other means ( e	1
19025	g	1
19026	, BLAST ) and can then be mapped to pathways ( such as Reactome or KEGG ) [ 95 , 96 ] to visualize [ 97 ] where viruses may influence the host response and identify mechanistic targets of hantaviruses .	1

19032	Test principle and assay procedure	1
19033	Each test solution ( 50 µl ) was pipetted onto the sample pad and driven to migrate by capillary action along the strip	1
19034	If @GENE$ odies were present in the serum or plasma , they would react wit@GENE$ tigen to fo@GENE$ mplex	1
19035	This complex would flow through the absorbent device and bind to the antigen in the positive reaction test zone ( ' T ' area ) , form@GENE$ mplex , producing a pink - purple colored band	1
19036	A colored band in the control region of the device indicates adequate sample volume and capillary action	1
19037	The absence of a colored band in the control region is an indication of an invalid result	1
19038	Positive results were read as soon as two colored bands appeared	1
19039	Negative samples provided only one pink control band	1
19040	If no control band was present , the test was considered invalid	1
19041	Color formation for both reactions was complete after 5 - 10 min	1
19042	A schematic representation of possible test results is shown in Fig	1

19044	Silencing experiments @GENE$ were introduced into the desired cell types by HIV - 1 vector - mediated transduction [ 55 ]	1
19045	Briefly , selfinactivating ( SIN ) @GENE$ were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells using a @GENE$ bearing a @GENE$ ( a mixture of two target sequences per gene was used )	1
19046	Virions were then purified and normalized by exo - RT , so that an identical viral input was used to challenge target cells with control or with the overall pool of @GENE$ , 2 , 3 specific @GENE$	1
19047	The silencing procedure was then adapted experimentally for each cell type to reach the best possible compromise between high silencing efficiency and optimal cell survival	1
19048	In the case of HeLaP4 cells , after a short Puromycin selection ( 4 days ) , cells were seeded and used as virus producing cells	1
19049	To this end , cells were challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent HIV - 1 ( NL4 - 3 ) to obtain a substantial fraction of virus - producing cells	1
19050	After extensive cell washing and @GENE$ treatment to remove non - internalized virus , cells were seeded and newly produced viruses were harvested 2 to 3 days afterwards from the supernatant of knockdown cells	1
19051	Virions were normalized by exo - RT and used to challenge naïve HeLaP4 cells	1
19052	The amount of infectious viral particles present in the different preparations was then assessed 24 hours later following a MAGI assay on these cells	1
19053	For silencing experiments in primary macrophages , cells were similarly transduced in the presence of virion - like particles containing @GENE$ ( @GENE$ provided at an MOIequivalent of 0 , 5 ) that increase the overall transduction efficiency of lentiviruses in human myeloid cells by removing a restriction at reverse transcription , according to a well - established protocol [ 39 ]	1
19054	In this case , silenced cells were used in the absence of Puromycin selection and were challenged with an MOI of 1 of the @GENE$	1
19055	After extensive cell washing and @GENE$ treatment , virions were harvested 4 to 6 days afterwards and similarly normalized by exo - RT prior to challenge of HeLaP5 cells ( expressing the CCR5 co - receptor ) and MAGI assay	1
19056	In the case of Jurkat cells , silenced cells were kept in Puromycin selection and used in replicative infections using the NL4 - 3 virus	1
19057	Aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested at different time points and the extent of viral spread was assessed by exo - RT activity	1
19058	To determine the intrinsic infectivity of viral particles produced in Jurkat cells treated as mentioned in the text , viral particles were retrieved at day 9 post infection to obtain sufficient amount of virus for our analysis , then viral preparations were normalized by exo - RT activity and used to challenge naïve HeLaP4 reporter cells	1
19059	The infectivity of normalized viral particles was then determined by a MAGI assay 24 hours later .	1
19060	The properties of the underlying network may have a significant effect on epidemic dynamics [ 39 ]	1
19061	We therefore consider how network properties change as fewer data are used by the various sampling schemes	1
19062	We first consider the number of strongly connected components of the network	1
19063	A subset of nodes forms a strongly connected component if each of the nodes can connect to each other node by following a path which preserves edge direction	1
19064	If the largest of these components is of the same order as the complete network it is known as the giant @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and gives a lower bound to the maximum size of an outbreak on the network if the disease is perfectly transmissible [ 33 ]	1
19065	In addition , we explore the impact of the sampling schemes upon the mean and standard deviation of the weighted w and unweighted k degree of nodes in the @GENE$	1
19066	Finally , we investigate the tendency for similar nodes to connect to each other through degree assortativity [ 40 , 41 ]	1
19067	These statistics are averaged over 1000 realizations of the network for each sampling method	1
19068	The diameter of the @GENE$ was also measured but , owing to extensive computational time , this was only calculated for a single realization of the network	1
19069	The diameter of a network is the length of the longest shortest path across the network [ 40 ]	1
19070	As well as the network statistics mentioned previously , we also explore the number of nodes and edges captured by the various sampling schemes as the percentage of sampled data varies .	1
19071	Exacerbations	1
19072	The existence of seasonal cycles of @DISEASE$ exacerbations is well established [ 7 , 14 , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]	1
19073	Children frequently experience a worsening of @DISEASE$ when they return to school after the summer break ; the peak of this " September @DISEASE$ epidemics " is around 2 weeks after the start of school [ 7 , 14 , 16 ]	1
19074	In 2006 , Johnston and Sears examined data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and found a clear seasonal pattern in ED visits and hospitalizations for @DISEASE$ , showing , for the 5 - 15 years ' age group , a relatively stable trend for the first 6 months of the year , a trough in the summer months , and then a rapid and substantial increase in mid - August , reaching the peak 2 weeks after return to school ; in children aged 2 - 4 , the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [ 16 ]	1
19075	More recently , Cohen et al	1
19076	analyzed data from 82234 @DISEASE$ children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for @DISEASE$ were fluctuating during the first part of the year , had a decline in the summer months , and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [ 7 ]	1
19077	Similarly to what is reported in the literature , our data show an increase in ED visits for @DISEASE$ in early autumn , but with a difference between children aged 0 - 5 and ≥ 6 years ( Figure 4 )	1
19078	In the younger group , the peak starts in September , reaches its maximum in October , and then continues for the whole autumn and early winter	1
19079	In the school - aged children , there is a peak only in September which is , however , lower than that observed during the spring , mainly in April and May .	1
19080	Elongation of the autophagosome membrane and formation of the complete autophagosome requires the recruitment of 2 ubiquitin - like ( @GENE$ ) conjugation systems	1
19081	In the first , @GENE$ becomes conjugated to @GENE$ in a process requiring the E1 - like enzyme @GENE$ and the E2 - like enzyme @GENE$	1
19082	ATG12 @GENE$ then binds to @GENE$ and forms a large complex known as the @GENE$	1
19083	This complex localises to the phagophore and can determine the site of conjugation of the second @GENE$ system	1
19084	In this second system , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is initially cleaved by @GENE$ near the @GENE$ at position G120 to generate @GENE$	1
19085	This subsequently becomes lipidated with phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) in a process requiring @GENE$ and another E2 - like enzyme @GENE$ to generate @GENE$ [ 19 ]	1
19086	@GENE$ is inserted into both the inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome , and as such , remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway [ 20 , 21 ]	1
19087	As a result , @GENE$ has become an extremely valuable marker protein for studying autophagy	1
19088	Figure 2	1
19089	Schematic of mammalian autophagy pathway	1
19090	@GENE$ is the major control complex for autophagy	1
19091	@GENE$ senses levels of amino acids , glucose and growth factors , as well as genotoxic and ER stress	1
19092	Upon stimulatory signals , @GENE$ becomes inactivated and the @GENE$ becomes hypophosphorylated and relocalises to the phagophore , along with @GENE$ , produced by @GENE$	1
19093	The @GENE$ and @GENE$ are also recruited to the growing autophagosome , allowing expansion of the membrane and fusion to give a complete autophagosome , engulfing organelles , @GENE$ and intracellular pathogens	1
19094	The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome , resulting in the degradation of the contents and recycling of nutrients into the cytoplasm .	1
19095	The residue was purified with reversed phase - high performance liquid chromatography , furnishing 9 as a colorless solid .	1
19096	Several recent experimental studies have now shown that some alternatives ( Table 4 ) resulted in similar or superior clinical outcomes compared to colistin for improving growth performance and intestinal integrity and in reducing of incidence of @DISEASE$ in weaned pigs	1
19097	In fact , no difference was observed in growth performance of weaned pigs supplemented with hop β - acids ( 120 , 240 , or 360 mg / kg ) or colistin ( 40 mg / kg ) during a trial period of 35 days [ 151 ]	1
19098	Moreover , the supplementation of weaned pigs with two Macrocephala flavored powder ( 3000 mg / kg ) increased significantly villus height in the duodenum and jejunum compared to that observed in colistin ( 300 mg / kg ) supplemented pigs [ 152 ]	1
19099	However , these studies ( Table 4 ) , were conducted in experimental conditions and in most cases in healthy weaned pigs	1
19100	Thus , further research is needed to demonstrate the stability and the efficacy of such alternatives ( probiotics , AMPs , medicinal plants ) in field conditions as well as the safety of these substances in animals and for consumers	1
19101	Also , work is needed to optimize the doses of these substances to incorporate in the feed to ensure their effectiveness in @DISEASE$ control	1
19102	The financial cost and the ease of administration of such alternatives are the other important criteria that should be taken into consideration in pig production .	1
19103	Trans - activation of PRRSV @GENE$ by @GENE$ was previously demonstrated by co - expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in cultured cells and by site - directed mutagenesis of the @GENE$ ( 18 , 19 )	1
19104	To study the phenomenon in vitro , a @GENE$ encompassing the @GENE$ and @GENE$ was subcloned between the @GENE$ of a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) such that expression of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was dependent upon @GENE$ within the inserted @GENE$	1
19105	In RRL in vitro translations , @GENE$ transcribed from pDluc / PRRSV specified the synthesis of only the product of the @GENE$ of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and no frameshifting was evident ( Figure 1C )	1
19106	However , supplementation with recombinant , purified @GENE$ yielded two additional proteins , the most abundant corresponding to the product of @GENE$	1
19107	The second protein migrated more rapidly than that of @GENE$ and we surmised that this protein corresponded to the product of a @GENE$ , as a @GENE$ is present immediately downstream of the @GENE$ ( underlined in Figure 1A )	1
19108	To confirm this , the @GENE$ ( UGA ) was changed to UUA , which extends the @GENE$ by 56 codons and simultaneously introduces a @GENE$ UAA thus shortening the @GENE$	1
19109	As expected , this point mutation increased the size of the predicted @GENE$ , and slightly reduced the size of the @GENE$ ( stop )	1
19110	These experiments indicate that the @GENE$ cloned into @GENE$ likely contains all of the @GENE$ required for PRRSV − 2 / − 1 frameshifting and that supplementation of the @GENE$ translations with @GENE$ alone is sufficient to transactivate frameshifting to levels similar to those seen in infected cells ( − 2 @GENE$ , 17 % ; − 1 @GENE$ , 7 % ; see Supplementary Table )	1
19111	The stimulation of @GENE$ by @GENE$ was specific to the PRRSV signal in that the protein had no effect on frameshifting at a variety of well - established sites of viral − 1 PRF ( Supplementary Figure S1 )	1
19112	Furthermore , the protein was unable to promote stop codon readthrough at variants of the PRRSV signal with an in - frame stop codon placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would be decoded in the peptidyl - ( P ) or aminoacyl - ( A ) site of the ribosome ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .	1
19113	The narratives on attribution of responsibility for managing the @DISEASE$ outbreak is most prevalent in the literature , with the limited capacity of the Canadian Health Care System to prepare for and respond to an emerging @DISEASE$ as a main narrative	1
19114	Many scholars pointed to flaws in the funding and organization of Canada ' s health care system - federally , provincially , and municipally - to explain the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Toronto	1
19115	Some argued that information was communicated inefficiently and was often incorrect ( Silas et al	1
19116	2006 )	1
19117	Personal protective equipment was in short supply ( Summers 2009 ) , and the use of occupational health and safety in Toronto ' s hospital system was inefficient , leading to further spread ( Silas et al	1
19118	2006 )	1
19119	Toronto ' s hospital system was also blamed for lacking admission policies and public laboratories ( Wong et al	1
19120	2007 ) : an inability to supply health services when demand suddenly increased and a lack of quality leadership ( Arya et al	1
19121	2009 )	1
19122	Toronto was also ill - prepared to address the unique vulnerability of the homeless to @DISEASE$ ( Leung et al	1
19123	2008 ) .	1
19124	In addition to travel , other factors related to globalization , such as urbanization and human activities are also thought to have facilitated the spread of @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$	1
19125	The global movement of humans and goods via international trade and the convenience of air travel have supported the ongoing spread of the @DISEASE$ ( World Health Organization 2017e )	1
19126	Analyses of the number of international travelers departing from Brazil and of the direction of spread of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ suggest that @DISEASE$ will continue to spread across South America into the Caribbean and the Southern USA ( Gyawali et al	1
19127	2016 ) .	1

19133	As shown in Figure 7 , the relative intake dose of the moving person increases quickly after the person starts to move ( t ≥ 1 s )	1
19134	The peak value appears at t = 5 s and t = 3 s for case 2 and 3 , corresponding to a moving distance of 2 m , where the moving person is quite close to the index patient	1

19142	For the present work , we employed the same @DISEASE$ strains as in our previously published in vivo studies ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) : JEV Laos , belonging to genotype 1 ( CNS769 _ Laos _ 2009 ; GenBank accession number KC196115	1

19149	@DISEASE$ were generated from monocytes as previously described ( 70 )	1
19150	To this end , blood from 6 - to 24 - month - old specific - pathogen - free ( SPF ) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated using density centrifugation ( 1	1
19151	077 g / liter ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech )	1
19152	Then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting with an LS column ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) as CD172a [UNK] cells using monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) clone 74 - 22 - 15 ( ATCC )	1
19153	Sorted monocytes were seeded at 5 [UNK] 10 5 / ml in DMEM - 10 % FB@GENE$ ac@GENE$ - CSF ; 20 U / ml , produced in - house [ 70 , 71 ] ) and cultured for 3 days at 39 ° C and 5 % CO 2	1
19154	After MDM differentiation , medium was replaced with fresh MDM ( for nonpolarized MDM ) or with medium supplemented@GENE$ L - 4 ( 100 U / ml , produced in - house ; for IL - 4 - polarized MDM ) ( 72 , 73 ) and incubated for another 24 h .	1
19155	Similar prevalence of @DISEASE$ in saliva and feces suggests that direct contact and environmental exposure could serve as complemenry transmission routes to arthropod vectors	1
19156	The presence of Bartonella in saliva samples contrasts with previous work showing an absence of Bartonella in vampire bat saliva [ 44 , 81 ] , providing evidence for possible direct transmission	1
19157	Bartonella in fecal samples could also suggest environmental transmission between bats [ 18 ]	1
19158	Both saliva - borne and fecal - oral transmission of @DISEASE$ could further pose potential risks to humans or livestock , either through bites during feeding or by environmental exposure of humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [ 18 , 38 , 48 , 82 ]	1
19159	For the former pathway , however , a recent survey of Bartonella in Mexican ruminants did not identify being bitten by vampire bats as a risk factor for infection [ 81 ] , and our phylogenetic results provide relatively more support for the possibility of vector - borne transmission	1
19160	Vector - borne transmission of @DISEASE$ might reduce their potential to infect humans or livestock , given the high host specificity of most bat flies [ 31 , 32 ]	1
19161	However , ectoparasite transfer between individuals could still occur during pupal deposition and close contact [ 83 ] , facilitating Bartonella transmission within vampire bat colonies and to other bat species	1
19162	While our analyses of ectoparasitism only considered bat flies , we have observed heavy tick burdens of vampire bats in other field sites ( e	1
19163	g	1
19164	, Belize )	1
19165	Bartonella has been detected in ticks infesting other bats [ 28 ] , and these ectoparasites could also be more likely to facilitate cross - species transmission [ 30 ]	1
19166	Metagenomics also potentially identified Bartonella ancashensis and B	1
19167	bacilliformis in vampire bat fecal samples , and these species cause notable @DISEASE$ in humans likely through phlebotomine sand flies in Andean regions of Peru [ 84 , 85 ]	1
19168	Controlled infection trials and more extensive phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella in vampire bats , their various ectoparasites , and sympatric prey are therefore needed to examine the contributions of different transmission routes for bacterial spread within vampire bats and to recipient prey and to confirm whether saliva and feces represent viable transmission routes	1
19169	Given the high rates of bat bites and proximity to wildlife , humans , and domestic animals that define vampire bat ecology , such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures would elucidate Bartonella transmission dynamics in this common host species and the risks of cross - species transmission .	1
19170	Bartonella prevalence across the 193 vampire bats included in this study was 67 %	1
19171	Our phylogenetic analysis of 35 vampire bat Bartonella sequences showed 78	1
19172	8 - 100 % pairwise identity in @GENE$ and revealed at least 11 paraphyletic genotypes ( S2 Table )	1
19173	BaTS analysis of all Desmodus - associated Bartonella showed significant phylogenetic clustering by country ( association index = 3	1
19174	81 , parsimony score = 31	1
19175	51 , p < 0	1
19176	001 ) , although most vampire bat Bartonella genotypes were still widely distributed ( Fig 1 )	1
19177	For the 11 genotypes delineated from our 35 sequences , we observed no association with the geographic study region ( χ 2 = 23	1
19178	3 , p = 0	1
19179	27 )	1
19180	@GENE$ 1 and 2 were detected across all regions , and @GENE$ 7 - 10 were detected within both Belize and Peru , highlighting the broad distribution of @GENE$ genotypes ( Fig 2 ) ; however , genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru , genotypes 4 - 6 were unique to the western Peruvian Amazon , and @GENE$ 11 was only detected in Belize .	1
19181	A similar surprising result was found when studying the effect modification by dietary patterns	1
19182	Here we queried the participants ' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al	1
19183	[ 38 ]	1
19184	Aware of the limitations of a one - time assessment of a habitual diet , we found a more pronounced relationship between @DISEASE$ and infections among @DISEASE$ people who reported an apparent healthier diet	1
19185	Thus , again only the group of @DISEASE$ individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of @DISEASE$	1
19186	The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without @DISEASE$ may explain the puzzle	1
19187	One can imagine that @DISEASE$ individuals may have an increased perception of @DISEASE$ related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by @DISEASE$ and frequent infections	1
19188	On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non - obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation	1
19189	Alternatively , among the group of people with @DISEASE$ a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both , @DISEASE$ and proneness to infections .	1
19190	First , we use analytical methods to show that ( i ) ignoring the latent period or ( ii ) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods ( when including the latent period ) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data	1
19191	We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an @DISEASE$ outbreak	1
19192	Finally , we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options .	1
19193	The protein @GENE$ from @DISEASE$ virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes	1
19194	49 These results were further confirmed and extended by Beale and colleagues who show that the cy@GENE$  M2@GENE$ teracts in a LI@GENE$ dependent manner with LC@GENE$ d promotes the relocalization of LC@GENE$  the plasma membrane	1
19195	62 We have identified a Wx@GENE$  po@GENE$ at has the highest PSSM score ( 8 to 9 ) , and corresponds to the one experimentally verified ( FVSI )	1
19196	27 , 72 It is an F @GENE$ d the fact that M2@GENE$ s been shown to block the autophagosome - lysosome fusion suggests that it may act as a an ad@GENE$ 	1

19201	, 1983 ; Burmeister et al	1
19202	, 1993 ; Crennell et al	1
19203	, 2000 ) and humans ( Chavas et al	1
19204	, 2005 ) suggested that @GENE$ share a highly conserved @GENE$ located within the @GENE$ ( Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig	1
19205	S5 )	1
19206	To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme , we determined the structure of @GENE$ in complex with diplacone	1
19207	The structure of @GENE$ CD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures	1
19208	The @GENE$ within the @GENE$ structure ( PDB entry 2vk5 ; Newstead et al	1
19209	, 2008 ) and the structure of @GENE$ in complex with the substrate @GENE$ ( N - acetylneuraminic acid ; PDB entry 2bf6 ; Newstead et al	1

19218	Consistent with our kinetic analysis , diplacone was bound to the @GENE$	1
19219	The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions	1
19220	The 3 0 , 4 0 , 5 , 7 0 - hydroxyl - 4 - oxo group and the O atom at the 1 - position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) as well as residues Arg285 , Asp328 , Phe353 , Tyr485 , Gln493 , Thr538 , Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292 , in addition to three water molecules ( W1 , W2 and W3 ) ( Fig	1
19221	2b and Supplementary Fig	1
19222	S6 )	1
19223	The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327 , Phe347 , Phe460 , Tyr485 and Tyr655 , which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation .	1
19224	All of Iterative HFold ' s underlying methods use the energy model of @GENE$ V2	1

19226	One of Iterative HFold ' s underlying methods is HFold - PKonly , which given the input structure only adds @GENE$	1
19227	HFold - PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true @GENE$ - free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a @GENE$ since , if the input structure only has the specific stem in question , the output structure of @GENE$ will determine if the given stem can be part of a @GENE$ .	1
19228	For the immunofluorescence assay , the cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 5 μg of ZIKV - prME vaccine	1

19249	The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods	1

19251	Considering the high urbanization level in Guangzhou , the affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) was the most dominant positive driving factor on the carbon emissions increment , while the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth at the residential sector .	1

19255	As with publications on bats , research effort on bat - associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the United States , a country with a nationwide surveillance program for monitoring and reporting of @DISEASE$ since 1938 [ 50 ] , followed by Australia , China , northern and central Europe , Japan , and Brazil ( Figure 5 )	1

19277	We measured binding of @GENE$ either to virus directly coated on ELISA - plate wells or to @GENE$	1
19278	For the direct virus binding assay , plates were coated with HIV - 1 JR - FL ( 20 ng p24 / well ) for 2 hours at 37uC , washed with PBS and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk in PBS	1
19279	After 1 hour at 37uC , plates were washed , @GENE$ were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC	1
19280	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 45 min at 37uC	1
19281	Finally , plates were washed , developed ( TMB solution , Life Technologies ) , and read at 450 nm using a plate reader ( BioTek ) .	1
19282	@GENE$ expression was previously reported in human uterine and vaginal epithelial cells [ 19 ]	1
19283	Using immunohistochemistry to survey @GENE$ expression at various sites in the human genital tract , we detected abundant @GENE$ expression in columnar epithelial cells lining the human penile urethra ( Figure 5A and 5D ; Figure S7A and S7D ) and endocervix ( Figure 5B and 5E ; Figure S7B and S7E )	1
19284	In contrast , little to no @GENE$ was observed in @DISEASE$ , and expression occurred only in the basal epithelial layer ( Figure 5C and 5F ; Figure S7C )	1
19285	A similar staining pattern was observed in foreskin tissue ( data not shown ) .	1
19286	All the samples from T1 ( colonies fed for four weeks with DWV - infected honeybee pupae ) and T2 ( colonies fed for eight weeks with DWV - infected honeybee pupae ) were strongly positive , with two exceptions ( one pooled sample each during week 13 and 15 )	1

19311	The @GENE$ consists of eight @GENE$ totaling over 13 , 100 nucleotides	1
19312	These code for up to eleven distinct @GENE$ , two with @GENE$ and one through alternate splicing	1
19313	Each of the eight @GENE$ has its own history of reassortment , inheritance , and mutation [ 5 ]	1
19314	In the same way , each of the major serotypes ( e	1
19315	g	1
19316	, H1N1 , H2N2 , H3N2 ) has its own rate of mutation and history of reassortment	1
19317	Almost all of the @GENE$ is protein coding , and 5	1
19318	7 % ( 749 nucleotides ) of the genome codes for two @GENE$ simultaneously ( Table 1 )	1
19319	Currently , there are thousands of fully - sequenced @GENE$ available in public databases , including a reconstructed version of a @GENE$	1
19320	Most of these have collection dates and lineage information associated with them	1
19321	Given this large body of data , it becomes feasible to test the attenuation model using mutation accumulation rates , non - synonymous amino acid changes , changing dN / dS ratios , changing transition / transversions ratios , and changes in codon specificity over time .	1
19322	Using simulation experiments based on a stochastic model for an @DISEASE$ attack , we illustrate the effect of the choice of filter and the statistical models upon radiograph - attributed outbreak signature detection .	1
19323	All but one of the @GENE$ obtained from the New Zealand cases were identical to the FPV vaccine strain that the cats had been inoculated with	1
19324	Co - infection with other pathogens including Feline coronavirus or Giardia spp	1
19325	could account for the clinical signs in five of these cases , which , although consistent with @DISEASE$ , were non - specific	1
19326	However , in one cat , high loads of vaccine strain virus were detected concurrently in lymph node and faeces ( FPV _ 221 , Table 3 ) , which is more consistent with loads attained by pathogenic virus strains than with those attained by vaccine virus strains	1
19327	Further , unequivocal support of the diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in this case was obtained from histological examination of the intestine , where lesions pathognomonic for @DISEASE$ were identified ( Figure 5 )	1
19328	An FPV - vaccine strain was detected in this cat , and the sequencing chromatogram showed no evidence of a coinfecting FPV or @DISEASE$	1
19329	However , deep sequencing of the sample @GENE$ f t@GENE$ scriptome or metagenome would be required to rule out co - infection with other pathogenic viruses not included in the qPCR test panel	1
19330	An alternative explanation is that there was reversion to virulence of the vaccine strain , although this has not been described previously in cats .	1
19331	Flash chromatography was performed with an Isolera One System from Biotage ( Upsala , Sweden ) using pre - packed KP - Sil SNAP - cartridges .	1
19332	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) signaling is essential for the development of many mononuclear phagocytes including microglia	1
19333	Tissue - resident macrophages , such as microglia , fail to develop in Csf1r − / − mice [ 9 ] , but in contrast to many tissue macrophages , adult microglia can still form in Csf1 op / op mice , which carry a natural null mutation in the @GENE$ [ 33 ]	1
19334	This is due to an alternative @GENE$ , @GENE$ , which is highly expressed by neurons [ 34 , 35 ]	1
19335	Similar to Csf1 op / op mice , @GENE$ − / − mice develop fewer microglia but do not lack peripheral macrophages [ 36 ]	1
19336	These mice are more susceptible to lethal @DISEASE$ , which is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis without increased viral replication [ 36 ]	1
19337	In order to temporally control microglial depletion , pharmacologic agents that antagonize CSF1R have been @GENE$ ped , including antagonist PLX5622 , which depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [ 37 ]	1
19338	These agents are being investigated as therapeutics in models of @DISEASE$ in which microglial activation is considered a contributing factor , such as @DISEASE$ [ 38 , 39 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 40 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 41 ]	1
19339	Here , we used PLX5622 in a model of @DISEASE$ to examine the effect of CSF1R antagonism in the setting of @DISEASE$	1
19340	Our results show that mice treated with PLX5622 ar@GENE$  susceptible to lethal @DISEASE$ , which is associated with increased CNS viral burden and @DISEASE$	1
19341	PLX5622 also reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and B7 co - stimulatory molecules within the infected CNS by depleting cellular sources , including re@GENE$ trat@GENE$ ecreasing expression on peripheral antigen - presenting cells ( APCs )	1
19342	The loss of APCs in the CNS resulted in limited local reactivation of recruited antiviral CD8 + T cells , which are required for virologic control in the CNS	1
19343	Together , these data demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation during viral infection in both the CNS and periphery and highlight the importance of microglia in orchestrating cell - mediated antiviral immunity during neurotropic infection .	1
19344	A low pathogenicity AI ( LPAI ) virus of the H9N2 subtype belonging to the G1 lineage [ 22 ] , A / chicken / Israel / 1163 / 2011 was isolated at the Kimron Veterinary Institute from swabs collected during surveillance activities , in Israel [ 23 ]	1
19345	A viral stock was produced by inoculating 9 - to - 11 - day - old embryonated specific pathogen free ( SPF ) hen ' s eggs , via the allantoic cavity and was subsequently titrated according to the Reed and Muench method [ 24 ] , to determine the embryo infectious dose 50 % ( EID 50 )	1
19346	The stock was screened to exclude the presence of bacterial agents and common viruses of poultry as previously described [ 25 ]	1
19347	The low pathogenicity of the virus had already been confirmed in a previous experimental study by calculating the intravenous pathogenicity index [ 26 ] that resulted to be 0	1
19348	The @GENE$ of the @GENE$ was made available in the GenBank database under the Accession Number JQ973659 by Davidson et al	1
19349	[ 23 ]	1
19350	The virus stock used in this studies had a history of three passages in embryonated chicken eggs .	1

19353	Read and Taubenberger [ 69 ] called the origin of human H1N1 an " enigma " whose riddle was not yet solved	1
19354	Like them , we see this as an unsolved riddle and we can only hope that our data might bring us one step closer to understanding the origins of this important disease .	1
19355	In the Limpopo Province of South Africa , @DISEASE$ is ranked the fourth among the major causes of death [ 5 ]	1
19356	In 2009 , the Limpopo Provincial @DISEASE$ Annual Report [ 6 ] stated that the number of @DISEASE$ cases in Vhembe district was 2194	1
19357	In 2012 , Vhembe district had the highest number of @DISEASE$ patients in the Limpopo Province [ 7 ]	1
19358	Tshitangano et al	1
19359	[ 8 ] , further indicated that @DISEASE$ infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of @DISEASE$ patients	1
19360	Infection control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [ 8 ]	1
19361	In line with this assertion , Gursimrat [ 9 ] argues that one of the major challenges to control @DISEASE$ infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure	1
19362	In addition , shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [ 10 ]	1
19363	@DISEASE$ - associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers	1
19364	It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for @DISEASE$ patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district , Limpopo Province .	1
19365	Previous reports have indicated that HAdV - 37 was associated with epidemic @DISEASE$ [ 30 , 31 ] , and HAdV - 57 was isolated from stool specimens of healthy or @DISEASE$ - affected children [ 4 , 32 ]	1
19366	Surprisingly , we found HAdV - 37 ( KM378014 ) and HAdV - 57 ( KM377992 ) each in single respiratory samples of inpatient children with @DISEASE$ , suggesting that they may not be limited to the conjunctiva and the gastrointestinal tract .	1
19367	Abbreviations @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; @GENE$ : @GENE$ ; KD : @DISEASE$ 	1
19368	As the first cases of @DISEASE$ were identified , studies have postulated that camels are likely a reservoir for the virus in the Middle East	1
19369	5 , 6 , 9 , 10 Given that 17 % of participants of the animal - exposed participants reported daily contact with @DISEASE$ , we would have expected to find some serological evidence of infection if @DISEASE$ was readily able to infect humans	1
19370	Several other studies have reported similar results where no serological evidence of @DISEASE$ was detected in domestic animalexposed populations , including abattoir workers in sites where infected camels have been documented	1
19371	10 , 11 During October 2012 , researchers in KSA collected and tested serum samples from 226 abattoir workers in Jeddah and Makkah	1
19372	Using an immunofluorescence assay , none had evidence of elevated MERS - CoV antibody	1
19373	11 Simil@GENE$ , in another 2013 study where nasal swabs from Egyptian camels suggested @DISEASE$ was present , there was no evidence of seropositivity among the camel workers with intense contact to these same camels	1
19374	10 species are serving as additional reservoirs for this pathogen or serving as vectors in transferring infection from camels to humans	1
19375	Alternatively , perhaps our assay lacks sensitivity , or @DISEASE$ infection may produce a weak or transient immune response following mild or asymptomatic infection	1
19376	Finally , it is possible that only a subset of the human population has the predilection to be infected by @DISEASE$ , either because of genetic polymorphisms or unusual routes of exposure .	1
19377	Although there is some evidence for the increase in virus replication and shedding in bats under stress , a direct link of this to spillover events has yet to be discovered	1
19378	Future controlled experiments aimed at studying transmission dynamics in the presence and absence of stress in bats would lead to a more definitive answer	1
19379	It is also important to look into various factors that might stress bats such as habitat destruction ( deforestation ) , pregnancy , change in seasons , and climate change	1
19380	Additionally , the molecular mechanisms leading to the waning of @GENE$ and other aspects of adaptive immune response in bats are not known	1
19381	A holistic picture of bat immune systems and the factors leading to an increase in viral replication might help us further understand viral spillovers .	1
19382	Single - plex reverse transcription real - time PCR ( RT - qPCR ) method could detect the presence 213 viruses in 158 ( 79 % ) children	1
19383	The findings corroborate the concept of viruses being the most common causative agent of @DISEASE$ and the data are consistent with hospital - based findings in Bangladesh reported by Homaira et al	1
19384	[ 11 ] and the comparable ' s were also published from Laos and Egypt [ 35 , 36 ]	1
19385	However , many studies in other regions including Brazil , Niger , Zambia , Spain , and Mexico reported higher viral detection rates ranging from 65 - 87 % [ 26 , [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ]	1
19386	The disparity in viral detection rates among these study findings might be due to variation in numbers of viruses that were included in the viral panel of each study group	1
19387	Our viral panel included ten common respiratory viruses including @DISEASE$ ( RSV ) , human rhinovirus ( HRV ) , influenza A and B viruses , human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 ( HPIV1 , HPIV2 , HPIV3 ) , human @DISEASE$ ( HMPV ) , human bocavirus ( HBoV ) , and adenovirus	1
19388	However , the panel did not include coronavirus which may account for a certain percentage of infections	1
19389	31	1
19390	5 % specimens were positive for HRV , which was predominantly detected as a viral pathogen	1
19391	However , the incidence rate of HRV was also higher in asymptomatic cases ( 23 % )	1
19392	Interestingly , the detection rate of adenovirus was higher in asymptomatic cases ( 10 % ) than the symptomatic specimens ( 7 % )	1
19393	A study conducted by Singleton et al	1
19394	also frequently identified HRV and adenoviruses in healthy children [ 41 ] , which makes it difficult to make any inference regarding the association of these two viruses with @DISEASE$	1
19395	RSV was the second most prevalent virus identified in 31 % cases	1
19396	However , unlike HRV , RSV has been reported as a recurrent cause of @DISEASE$ in both children younger than five years old and adult , with incidence reaching 26 % ( Laos PDR ) , 33 % ( Mexico ) , 35 % ( Niger ) , 37 % ( Brazil ) , 51 % ( Germany ) , 57 % ( India ) , and 76 % ( Spain ) of the investigated cases [ 35 , 37 - 40 , 42 , 43 ]	1
19397	RSV can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections	1
19398	After RSV , HMPV ( 13 % ) , HBoV ( 11 % ) and HPIV - 3 ( 10	1
19399	5 % ) came out as the third , fourth , and fifth most prevalent viral agents	1
19400	However , we observed relatively low pathogen detection rates for HPIV - 1 , HPIV - 2 , influenza A , and influenza B viruses	1
19401	Thus after RSV , HMPV , HBoV , and HPIVs came out as the frequent causes of hospitalization of children with respiratory illness and the findings are consistent with other published data [ 24 ]	1
19402	Approximately 70 - 89 % cases of bronchiolitis had been reported to associate with RSV infection and 3 - 25 % with parainfluenza viruses and there werek very few cases of bronchiolitis which could be attributed to human influenza virus and adenovirus [ 44 , 45 ]	1
19403	Several studies have described frequencies of 3	1
19404	3 - 19 % for HMPV infections in hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections [ 7 , [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] , although HMPV has been known to cause severe respiratory infections in the elderly [ 48 , 49 ]	1
19405	The frequency of HBoV identified in this study ( 11 % ) was also comparable with HBoV detection rates in Spain ( 9	1
19406	9 % ) and Vietnam ( 7	1
19407	2 % ) [ 50 , 51 ] .	1

19410	We subtract an average of the past values ( mostly days 6 - 11 in the past ) .	1
19411	For Co - IP assay , the @GENE$ and @GENE$ were cotransfected into HEK293T cells as described above	1
19412	The cells were collected at 48 hpt , washed two times with cold PBS , and lyzed with the CHAPS lysis buffer ( 1 % CHAPS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7	1
19413	5 ] ) containing 1 mM PMSF ( catalog no	1
19414	ST506 ; Beyotime ) and 1 mg / mL protease inhibitor cocktail at 4 [UNK] C for 1 h	1
19415	The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13 , [UNK] for 20 min at 4 [UNK] C	1
19416	The clarified lysate was treated with a mixture of @GENE$ ( 25 U / mL ) ( catalog no	1
19417	2158 ; TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) and @GENE$ ( 1 U / µL ) ( catalog no	1
19418	PF0059 ; Fermentas , Burlington , Canada ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to Co - IP analysis	1
19419	The lysate was precleared with the @GENE$ ( catalog no	1
19420	11243233001 ; Roche ) at 4 [UNK] C for 4 h followed by incubation with the indicated @GENE$ at 4 [UNK] C for 4 h , and the @GENE$ was then added and incubated at 4 [UNK] C for 2 h	1
19421	The @GENE$ was washed three times with PBS , and the bound proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated @GENE$ .	1
19422	The @GENE$ ( GenBank accession no	1
19423	NM _ 001097418	1
19424	2 ) and its various domains were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCMV - Myc vector ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) to generate @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , respectively	1
19425	The @GENE$ ( GenBank accession no	1
19426	EU497410	1
19427	1 ) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the [UNK] - CMV - 10 vector ( Sigma - Aldrich , ST	1
19428	Louis , MO , USA ) or pCMV - Myc to generate @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
19429	The primers for amplifying @GENE$ are listed in Table 1 .	1
19430	There are mainly two possible explanations for the synergistic effect of DIs and proteasome inhibitors : First , the amount of free ubiquitin is significantly reduced by the accumulation of @GENE$ and the lack of recycling of @GENE$	1
19431	This might interfere with the function of the @GENE$ as early acting @GENE$ like @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) possess @GENE$ , and thus ubiquitin may play an important role in their substrate recognition [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]	1
19432	Second , the addition of DIs together with proteasome inhibitors might lead to the accumulation of so - called @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
19433	@GENE$ are de novo synthesized @GENE$ , which are rapidly degraded via the UPS	1
19434	Originally , it was shown that the @GENE$ is a bona fide substrate for the @GENE$ - pathway [ 94 ] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of @GENE$ [ 38 ]	1
19435	Combinatory treatment of cells with DIs might lead to a further enhancement of accumulated @GENE$ within the cell	1
19436	Thereby , those @GENE$ interfere with virus release by disturbing the highly ordered assembly of @GENE$ in a prion - like manner [ 38 ] .	1
19437	The other intriguing feature of this virus is the strong tropism for the oviduct tissues , and in particular for the infundibulum	1
19438	This feature might be a strain - specific characteristic , depending on either the ability to spread systemically , the cleavability of the @GENE$ by unknown @GENE$ [ 42 ] , or the @GENE$ binding preference that determines the attachment of the virus to the epithelia	1
19439	Besides @DISEASE$ viruses , known to replicate in the reproductive tract of chickens [ 43 ] , @DISEASE$ viruses have been associated with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ but mostly in turkey breeders [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] , while only few reports describe the colonization of the oviduct by non - H9 subtypes of LPAI viruses upon either natural or experimental infection [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] .	1
19440	As treatment with P22077 or @GENE$ led to reduced @GENE$ processing , which should also reduce virus infectivity [ 61 ] , we next determined the impact of these DIs on the infectivity of released HIV - 1 virus particles	1
19441	To perform single round infections , we generated @GENE$ lycoprotein ( VSV - G ) pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs by transfecting HEK293T cells that were either	1
19442	Cells were pulse - labeled for 20 minutes with 250 μCi of [ 35 S ] - cys / met labeling mix and chased in complete medium for the indicate time periods , followed by immunoprecipitation , as described before [ 23 ] .	1
19443	Cloning of @GENE$ and @GENE$ in @GENE$ has been described earlier [ 15 ]	1
19444	@GENE$ tagged @GENE$ [ 12 ] , @GENE$ containing @GENE$ cloned upstream of the @GENE$ ( NF - κB @GENE$ ) [ 10 ] , @GENE$ in @GENE$ [ 20 ] and @GENE$ [ 21 ] constructs were gifts from Drs	1
19445	Rene Bernards , Ranjan Sen , Richard Benarous and Vijay Kumar , respectively	1
19446	All @GENE$ used for mammalian cell transfection were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation [ 22 ]	1
19447	All @GENE$ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc	1
19448	( California , USA ) ; TPA and MG - 132 were purchased from Calbiochem Chemicals ( California , USA )	1

19451	Generally , lycorine was detected in the extracts of all different parts of H	1
19452	littoralis	1
19453	As shown in Table 2 , the highest content of lycorine was found in the bulb	1
19454	This finding is in agreement with that of Abou - Donia et al	1
19455	[ 13 ] that the bulbs of Narcissus cv	1
19456	Breath of Spring plants possess higher amount of lycorine	1
19457	Nevertheless , flower and anther extract also contained high amount of lycorine of 2	1
19458	43 and 2	1
19459	13 g per mg of extract , respectively	1
19460	Stem and leaves extracts of H	1
19461	littoralis had lesser lycorine content compared to previous plant parts , while the least amount of lycorine was found in the root extract .	1
19462	Development of @GENE$ against emerging @DISEASE$ requires a significant production cost and poses as a major drawback	1
19463	To overcome this obstacle and to reduce the cost , extremely powerful neutr@GENE$  can be given in smaller doses without compromising the efficacy is needed	1
19464	One strategy to achieve this could be to design human@GENE$ exceptional binding attraction and targeting them against the potential targets , such as RBD .@GENE$ 	1
19465	In conclusion , our study uncovers a novel interesting aspect of the biology of @GENE$ and provides an interesting example of how a single @GENE$ may interfere at two different steps of the viral life cycle using a seemingly similar mechanism	1
19466	These findings may apply to other pathogens and yield a more complex view of the manner in which this emerging family of @GENE$ can interfere with viral pathogens .	1
19467	Primers were designed to target either the @GENE$	1
19468	@GENE$ containing either the @GENE$ or @GENE$ were used to clone the @GENE$	1
19469	To target the @GENE$ , the primers included @GENE$ ( Table 1 )	1
19470	Primers against the @GENE$ included @GENE$	1
19471	@GENE$ sequences were amplified via PCR and cloned into the @GENE$	1
19472	Clones were verified for sequencing ( GenScript , Piscataway , NJ , USA )	1
19473	Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequence for the @GENE$ were designed and cloned into the @GENE$ and verified by sequencing ( GenScript ) .	1
19474	To determine whether endogenous @GENE$ could be incorporated into HIV - 1 particles , we first compared virions issued from HEK293T versus HeLa cells treated or not with @GENE$ ( Figure 4B )	1
19475	Twenty - four hours after transfection with @GENE$ , cells were washed and then treated with 1000U / mL of @GENE$ for further 48 hours , prior to virion particle purification	1
19476	Virion particles were then either analyzed by WB or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells upon exo - RT purification to determine their infectivity by flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards	1
19477	When HIV - 1 virions were produced in HEK293T cells , no detectable amounts of @GENE$ were found , irrespectively of @GENE$ stimulation suggesting that @GENE$ may have to reach a certain amount to be promptly incorporated into virions	1
19478	In contrast , virion produced in HeLa cells incorporated readily detectable levels of @GENE$ and this incorporation was increased upon @GENE$ stimulation	1
19479	When virion particles produced in these conditions were normalized and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells , a drastic decrease in infectivity was observed in virions produced in HeLa cells versus viruses produced in HEK293T cells and @GENE$ stimulation did not grossly modify these differences .	1

19482	The section on the " Risk model " directs the reader to several references of previous work	1
19483	However , the reader may not be familiar with these methodologies and , most importantly , this significant part of the paper should stand alone	1
19484	To enable a more friendly reading , the authors are kindly required to provide the data used in the methodology , step by step , as supplementary data ( i	1

19487	This would improve a lot the quality and value of this publication .	1
19488	The results of this work imply that the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient	1
19489	Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers into consideration is necessary	1
19490	A better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient is also important for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin	1
19491	To reduce the pathogen concentration in the high - dose region close to the index patient , a personal ventilation system may be a feasible solution which is still needed to be carefully designed and verified in airplane cabin operation	1
19492	Using N95 respirator masks of the index patient or the passengers can also be a simple and viable method to prevent exposure from inhalation the expiratory aerosols	1
19493	In future studies , investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control .	1

19502	This likelihood value is much higher than that of the previous cases	1

19506	Reduced colistin usage in livestock and particularly in swine is highly promoted worldwide and is required in Europe as a public health measure to reduce colistin resistance spread , and to prevent the loss of polymyxins effectiveness in human medicine [ 25 ]	1
19507	Furthermore , concurrent treatment with colistin in piglets was associated with the isolation of resistant bacteria from the earliest days of treatment [ 28 ]	1
19508	Almost all studies conducted on isolates from pigs worldwide to screen @GENE$ presence in enterobacterial species reported that colistin resistant isolates harboring this gene also showed resistance to one or several classes of antimicrobials conventionally used in swine such as : aminoglycoside , sulphonamide , trimethoprim , tetracycline , quinolone , lincosamide , β - lactam , and third generation cephalosporin [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] .	1
19509	where s represents the given ( G + C ) 3 % value [ 21 ] .	1
19510	Considering these observations , the present study addressed the potential role of the nasal epithelium in contact transmission	1
19511	Our hypothesis was based on the observation that after oronasal @DISEASE$ challenge of immune pigs , it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia indicating local virus replication ( 9 )	1
19512	While @DISEASE$ is also found in tonsils ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) , immune animals ' tonsils were found to be protected from infection , indicating that this organ is infected only following @DISEASE$ ( 9 ) and would therefore not represent the point of @DISEASE$ entry	1
19513	On the other hand , a recent study demonstra@GENE$ esence of viral RNA in the nasal epithelium as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelium ( 11 )	1
19514	We therefore investigated whether the nasal epithelium can be infected from the apical surface and whether this infection would cause both apical and basolateral virus shedding	1
19515	This would indeed represent a prerequisite for the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract to play a role in direct transmission of @DISEASE$	1
19516	The present work included ex vivo and in vitro experimental models as porcine nasal explants and well - differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells ( NEC ) cultured at the air - liquid interface ( ALI )	1
19517	In fact , our data demonstrate that JEV has the ability of infecting apically , resulting in both apical and basolateral virus shedding in swine nasal epithelial cells and indicating that the porcine nasal mucosa could represent a gateway for @DISEASE$ entry and exit in pigs	1
19518	Furthermore , we demonstrat@GENE$ l cells release soluble factors favoring subsequent infections of macrophages known to be present in the lamina propria of the mucosa .	1
19519	Having shown the important role of @GENE$ in PGE 2related @DISEASE$ proliferation , we further investigated whether the PGE 2 - mediated up - regulation@GENE$ DK1 reflected transactivation of the gene	1

19560	We have previously suggested that the maternal administration of molecular hydrogen ( H 2 ) plays a neuroprotective role in the fetal brain against injury caused by @DISEASE$ and inflammation 12 - 14	1
19561	Ohsawa et al	1
19562	discovered that H 2 acts as an antioxidant that selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radicals ( • OH ) and protects the brain from injury 15	1
19563	H 2 reacts with strong oxidants , such as • OH , but remains mild enough to neither disturb the metabolic redox reactions nor affect ROS signaling	1
19564	Several subsequent studies have explored the therapeutic and preventive effects of H 2 , and have indicated that H 2 has other properties as well , including anti - inflammatory and anti - apoptotic effects 16 , 17	1
19565	The safety and some promising benefits of H 2 have already been demonstrated , not only in animal models but also in patients , including those with @DISEASE$ 18 , @DISEASE$ 19 and mild @DISEASE$ 20 , although no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to date	1
19566	Recently , we demonstrated that the administration of H 2 to pregnant mouse dams significantly increased H 2 concentration in the fetal brain , through the maternal - fetal interface , in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced @DISEASE$ 12	1
19567	@DISEASE$ damage in this MIA model and the effect of maternal H 2 administration on this damage can be summarized as follows 12 : ( 1 ) high mortality rate of @DISEASE$ fetuses , ( 2 ) @DISEASE$ associated with elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytoki@GENE$ ivation , and oxidative damage in the MIA fetal brains , and ( 3 ) attenuation of these adverse outcomes by maternal H 2 administration	1
19568	Thus , the protective effect of maternal H 2 administration on short - term outcomes in the @DISEASE$ offspring has been demonstrated	1
19569	However , long - term outcomes of the surviving offspring are yet to be investigated	1
19570	Therefore , the present study investigated long - term neurological outcomes in the MIA mouse model and the efficacy of H 2 administration in pregnant dams , using both histological and behavioral examinations	1
19571	Astrocytes , which are the most abundant cell population in the CNS , play a key role in normal brain development 21 , 22	1
19572	However , when astrocytes are exposed to maternally - derive@GENE$  , they secrete various cytokines tha@GENE$ neurodevelopmental impairments 23	1
19573	Moreover , activation of astrocytes is known to be a factor in the prolongation of brain damage , and contributes to the formation of glial scars that limit neuronal plasticity 24	1
19574	Thus , in the present study , the MIA - related astrocytic activation and its modification by H 2 administration were also investigated , both in vivo and in vitro .	1
19575	However , other proposed causes of the @DISEASE$ epidemic included seasonal triggers , infection of nonhuman primates , landscape modification by humans , poverty , inadequate public health infrastructure , conflict , and population growth ( Farmer 1996 )	1
19576	Failure to focus on these and narrowly focusing on cultural practices politicizes the @DISEASE$ epidemic ; yet , public health authorities , governments , and academics have largely attributed disease responsibility to local culture .	1
19577	Ironically , disease outbreaks facilitated the development of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network ( GPHIN ) , an information sharing platform whose aim is to improve the credibility and authority of public health specialists to manage an outbreak	1
19578	The platform is thought to have reduced the time between the outbreak and reporting and is thought to contribute to 40 % of WHO ' s early warning and played a role in @DISEASE$ notification , and subsequent outbreaks ( Huff and Winnebah 2015 ) .	1
19579	When reporting on time and memory consumption of Iterative HFold and @GENE$ on the HK - PK data set , we did not include the time and memory required to get the input structures to Iterative @GENE$	1
19580	Since we only run @GENE$ V2	1
19581	0 partially to produce @GENE$ it does not take as long as running @GENE$ and does not consume as much memory	1
19582	For example , for the @GENE$ in our data set ( A	1
19583	tum	1
19584	@GENE$ ) , it only takes 0	1
19585	5 seconds time and 4 MB of memory to produce the @GENE$	1
19586	( The time required to get the @GENE$ for all RNA sequences in this data set is provided in Additional file 4	1
19587	) We also note that since calculating @GENE$ and running Iterative @GENE$ are done sequentially , the memory consumption is calculated as the maximum of the two , so the memory consumption of Iterative @GENE$ for this sequence is still the same even including the memory needed for calculating @GENE$	1
19588	As we can see based on this example , even including time and memory requirements of calculating @GENE$ , Iterative HFold is still faster than @GENE$ and uses less memory .	1
19589	The confidence intervals for HFold and Iterative @GENE$ with @GENE$ are ( 73	1
19590	35 % , 83	1
19591	53 % ) and ( 72	1
19592	83 % , 83	1
19593	37 % ) , respectively , and on pseudoknot - free structures they are ( 75	1
19594	53 % , 80	1
19595	79 % ) and ( 74	1
19596	93 % , 80	1
19597	26 % ) respectively	1
19598	Again , based on the result of the permutation test , the difference in the results of @GENE$ and Iterative @GENE$ on pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures are not significant	1
19599	Similarly , the permutation test shows that the difference in prediction accuracy of @GENE$ and Iterative @GENE$ on @GENE$ input is not significant .	1

19605	, 2011 )	1
19606	A recent study using cultured rodent neurons showed that @GENE$ regulation of @GENE$ is conserved in mammals	1
19607	Mammalian @GENE$ can deubiquitinate both @GENE$ and @GENE$ subunits and protect @GENE$ from degradation ( Huo et al	1
19608	, 2015 )	1
19609	@GENE$ is expressed throughout the brain , including the hippocampus , amygdala , cerebellum and prefrontal cortex , and colocalizes with @GENE$ and @GENE$ at synapses in cultured neurons ( Tomida et al	1
19610	, 2009 ; Huo et al	1
19611	, 2015 )	1
19612	Knock - down of @GENE$ , but not @GENE$ , results in increased levels of ubiquitinated GluA1 , decreased surface and total levels of @GENE$ , and reduced mEPSC amplitudes , consistent with a role for @GENE$ in deubiquitinating @GENE$ ( Huo et al	1
19613	, 2015 )	1
19614	Interestingly , @GENE$ is preferentially modified with @GENE$ , which typically promotes endo - lysosomal trafficking ( Huo et al	1
19615	, 2015 ; Widagdo et al	1
19616	, 2015 )	1
19617	Prior studies showed that @GENE$ have promiscuous chain selectivity and recombinant @GENE$ prefers @GENE$ in vitro ( Faesen et al	1
19618	, 2011 )	1
19619	In contrast , Huo et al	1
19620	( 2015 ) showed that @GENE$ preferentially deubiquitinates @GENE$ with @GENE$ in HEK293 cells , suggesting that @GENE$ chain specificity is controlled by other factors in vivo	1
19621	Together , these data reveal a conserved mechanism where @GENE$ deubiquitinates @GENE$ at synapses to protect them from degradation and promote their recycling to the cell surface to affect synapse function	1
19622	In addition to @GENE$ , @GENE$ can also deubiquitinate mammalian AMPARs indicating that multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control AMPAR ubiquitination levels ( Scudder et al	1
19623	, 2014 ) .	1
19624	The dynamical consequences of these differences in the distribution of infectious and latent periods have received some attention over the past two decades	1
19625	It has been shown , for example , that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [ 21 , 24 ] , though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [ 22 , 26 ]	1
19626	When contact rates vary seasonally , for example , to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [ 28 , 29 ] , changes in p ( t ) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [ 25 , 26 , 30 ]	1
19627	An issue that has received surprisingly little attention , despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible ' ' deliberate exposure , ' ' is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population	1
19628	This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within - host dynamics of @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$ , for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [ 31 , 32 ]	1
19629	In particular , Lloyd [ 33 ] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions	1
19630	Here we are interested in the application of this work to between - host transmission dynamics	1
19631	As can be seen in Figure 1B , changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve : in comparison to a gamma - distributed model , the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model ( i ) takes off at a dramatically slower rate , ( ii ) predicts a significantly smaller ( approximately 56 % ) peak number of cases , and ( iii ) lasts much longer ( almost twice as long ) .	1
19632	During the tick bite , the virus is inoculated into the skin of the vertebrate host	1
19633	The initial replication is believed to occur locally in the dendritic cells	1
19634	This is followed by infection of the draining lymph nodes , resulting in the primary viremia and subsequent infection of the peripheral tissues , where further replication maintains the viremia for several days [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ]	1
19635	The disease course of @DISEASE$ is biphasic ; the initial phase is characterized by flu - like symptoms and is followed by a second phase involving @DISEASE$ , with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$ [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]	1
19636	The mortality rate of @DISEASE$ varies from 1 to 20 % depending on the subtype , in which the European TBEV subtype has shown lower mortality rates compared to the Siberian and Far Eastern [ 23 , 40 , 44 ]	1
19637	Among the patients that experience neuroinvasive @DISEASE$ , approximately 25 - 40 % of the survivors suffer from long lasting @DISEASE$ [ 45 , 46 ]	1
19638	No antivirals are available for treatment of @DISEASE$ but there is an effective vaccine [ 25 , 47 ]	1
19639	LGTV , which is closely related to TBEV , is found in south east Asia and Russia [ 17 ]	1
19640	LGTV has not been associated with human disease under natural infections although it shares 84 % sequence identity with TBEV [ 17 ]	1
19641	Because of its avirulence in humans and close similarity to TBEV , LGTV is often used as a model virus for TBEV under biosafety level - 2 conditions .	1
19642	The survey response rate varied slightly by study region	1
19643	Excluding calls to ineligible participants ( i	1

19645	, did not meet inclusion criteria ) and disqualified numbers ( e	1
19646	g	1
19647	, not in service , wrong number , fax / computer / business line ) , the final response rate was 27 % for the City of Toronto and 31 % for York Region .	1
19648	The @GENE$ immunohistology technique was described previously ( [ 75 ] )	1
19649	Two @GENE$ were used : 1 ) @GENE$ purified from rabbit serum raised against @GENE$ and @GENE$ of @GENE$ ( provided by Neil Simister , Brandeis University ) for use on frozen sections ( Figure 5 ) , and 2 ) @GENE$ obtained from Novus Biologicals for use on paraffin sections following citrate buffer ( pH 6	1
19650	0 ) antigen retrieval ( Figure S7 )	1
19651	Sections were blocked with serum - free protein solution , and optimally diluted @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( negative control ) were added and incubated for 1 - 2 hours at RT	1
19652	Binding of @GENE$ to @GENE$ in tissues was visualized using an @GENE$ detection system that stains positive cells bright red	1
19653	Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover - slipped using aqueous mounting medium .	1
19654	Participants articulated that highlighting the increasing cost of managing patients infected with resistant organisms and the economic loss from @DISEASE$ could be a potential way of drawing attention to the topic and getting funds to drive programs	1
19655	As specific examples , participants illustrated not just the costs of treating resistant infections , but also the costs associated with implementing stricter infection control measures .	1
19656	As mentioned and reviewed in Table 1 , the LMDI methods based on the IDA theory , were used frequently to quantitatively analyze the drivers of carbon emissions at the city - level	1
19657	The LMDI technique based on the IDA theory and an extended Kaya identity was conducted to uncover the main driving forces for energy - related carbon emissions in Guangzhou city	1
19658	The Kaya identity [ 18 , 64 , 80 , 81 ] expresses carbon emissions as a product of four underlying driving factors :	1
19659	Then , the changes of regional carbon emissions between two years can be decomposed as :	1

19662	Quantitative RT - PCR was performed to investigate how @GENE$ protected against virus infection in relation to the virus infection cycle	1
19663	The amounts of @GENE$ and RNA isolated from cells grown with or without HSV DNA polymerase inhibitor ( Phosphonoacetic acid , PAA ) in the culture media were analyzed by quantitative real - time PCR ( Figure 5 )	1
19664	PAA inhibited the synthesis of @GENE$ in infected cells and the activity of the @GENE$ in vitro [ 33 ]	1
19665	PAA was used to investigate the antiviral effects by 3D8 scFv @GENE$ activity in the immediate early stage before de novo viral DNA replication	1
19666	The changes in @GENE$ content in HeLa , SCH07072 , and muSCH cells were traced at immediate early ( 2 hr after virus challenge , @GENE$ ) , early ( 6	1
19667	5 hr after virus challenge , UL9 ) , and late ( 25 hr after virus challenge , UL19 ) stages of infection ( Figure 5A )	1
19668	Viral DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells was reduced by up to 94	1
19669	2 % under the PAA - untreated condition , compared to HeLa cells at each stage	1
19670	Virus DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by up to 80 % compared to that in HeLa cells at all stages of infection	1
19671	In contrast , muSCH cells under the PAA - untreated condition showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at the early stage of infection , but 68 % more @GENE$ was detected in muSCH cells compared to HeLa cells at the late stage	1
19672	The accumulation of @GENE$ in SCH07072 indicates that nuclear @GENE$ can degrade @GENE$ directly , resulting in less accumulation of @GENE$ ( Figure 5B ) .	1
19673	All 307 samples were subjected to canine Kobuvirus identification by one step RT - PCR using primers specific to @GENE$ of CaKoV [ 21 ]	1
19674	First , RNA extraction was performed using the QIAsymphony DSP Viral / Pathogen mini kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) following manufacturer ' s instructions	1
19675	To detect CaKoV , RNA samples were screened for @GENE$ of CaKoV by using one step RT - PCR assay .	1
19676	Histopathology of the small intestine was performed in six cases , including five in which samples were collected for PCR and sequencing ( Table 4 )	1
19677	In four of these , lesions of mild @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 ) or @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) were present	1
19678	In one case ( 221 , Table 3 ) , histological lesions were typical of @DISEASE$ ( Figure 5 ) , with multiple sections of jejunum and ileum showing mild multifocal loss and replacement of crypts by karyorrhectic and cellular debris ( necrosis ) and low - to - moderate numbers of neutrophils within the lamina propria	1
19679	Low numbers of the remaining crypts were variably lined by degenerate or necrotic epithelium with intraluminal degenerate neutrophils , debris and sloughed necrotic epithelial cells ( crypt abscesses )	1
19680	Neutrophils frequently invaded the remaining crypt epithelium	1
19681	Rare epithelial cells contained 4 - 6 µm - diameter polygonal - to - ovoid , eosinophilic - to - amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies that occasionally marginated the chromatin	1
19682	The@GENE$ erate multifocal crypt regeneration , and crypts were frequently lined by large epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei that were piled up or in mitosis	1
19683	Intestinal lymphoid tissue appeared mildly depleted	1
19684	The morphological diagnosis was moderate diffuse @DISEASE$ with @DISEASE$ , epithelial regeneration and rare intranuclear viral inclusions	1
19685	These findings were consistent with @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$	1
19686	( Table 4 )	1
19687	Of the cases where sections of mesenteric lymph nodes ( n = 3 ) or thymus ( n = 1 ) were available , lesions of mild @DISEASE$ were present in one case , which was the same animal with @DISEASE$ consistent with @DISEASE$ ( case 221 )	1
19688	Affected cortical follicles were small and poorly populated .	1
19689	No littermates were affected , the cat recovered , and no other cases of suspected @DISEASE$ were encountered in this region	1
19690	Another sequence in this clade was from a 14 - week - old stray kitten with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and failure to gain weight	1
19691	The kitten , from a shelter in Melbourne , had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine	1
19692	It also tested positive on a multiplex qPCR faecal panel for Giardia spp	1
19693	and Canine protoparvovirus 1	1
19694	The third sequence was from an owned 8 - week - old kitten in Sydney with acute onset @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , vaccinated 3 days before ( vaccine type unknown )	1
19695	Of the two closely @GENE$ quences @GENE$ e ( FPV _ 260 ) was from a 10 - week - old kitten vaccinated 4 days before with the same vaccine strain , which presented for @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
19696	It also tested positive for Giardia spp	1
19697	on a faecal antigen test	1
19698	The other ( FPV _ 254 ) was from an unvaccinated stray 8 - month - old cat that presented with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ and tested positive @GENE$ CPV antigen test	1
19699	Finally , two other Australian sequences - FPV 193 / 170 and Tasmania / 2010 - did not fall into a distinct clade but were relatively closely related to each other and to the vaccine cluster ( clade D ) .	1
19700	Unfortunately , there have also been few published reports on the peripheral blood dynamics during @DISEASE$	1
19701	Reports do show inc@GENE$ plexes and levels [ 9 ] , al@GENE$ plexes do not necessarily portend worse prognosis [ 98 ]	1
19702	Peripheral lymphocyte analysis did not indicate an increase in IgA + cells in acute , subacute and convalescent @DISEASE$ patient samples [ 3 ]	1
19703	In fact , there was actually a relative paucity of IgA + peripheral B cells from @DISEASE$ samples compared to controls	1
19704	Interestingly , the lack of IgA + peripheral B cells continued through convalescence	1
19705	Other studies have shown no changes in acute and convalescent B cell subgroups , but increases in CD69 + natural killer and γδ T cells were observed [ 99 ]	1
19706	Recently , the@GENE$ l marker CD 19 + was used to show an increase in both number of B cells and relative percentage in @DISEASE$ compared to controls	1
19707	The percent of ' activated ' CD86 + B cells was also significantly elevated [ 100 ]	1
19708	There was also a global increase in the ability of B c@GENE$  t@GENE$ crete @GENE$ , IgG @GENE$ A after TLR - 9 stimulation , something that has been previously unexplored in the literature	1
19709	Overall , in the small number of studies relating to the peripheral blood B cell compartment , there is not a consensus as to whether B cells are responsible for enhanced pathogenesis .	1
19710	The exact role of microglia during @DISEASE$ has been difficult to define because infiltrating monocytes can mask the impact of resident microglia	1
19711	In a previous report , IL34 − / − mice , which have significantly reduced development of @DISEASE$ , are more susceptible to lethal infection after WNV - NS5 - E218A i	1
19712	c	1
19713	inoculation [ 36 ]	1
19714	Similar to results reported here , IL34 − / − mice exhibited increased @DISEASE$ death compared with wildtype controls	1
19715	In contrast with PLX5622 - treated mice , IL34 − / − mice exhibited similar levels of viral burden compared with wildtype controls in the brain at 3 and 6 dpi	1
19716	Numbers of infiltrating monocytes / macrophages and WNV - specific T cells were also similar between IL34 − / − and wildtype controls ; however , the authors did not investigate antiviral T cell activation in this model [ 36 ]	1
19717	In another model of @DISEASE$ , in which suckling mice were infected with @DISEASE$ , depletion of microglia with liposome - encapsulated clodronate resulted in increased viral replication and reduced infiltration of IFNγ + CD8 + T cells [ 70 ]	1
19718	Here , we report no reduction in CD8 + T cell infiltration ; however , this difference may be due to the age of mice , virus , and / or method of microglial depletion	1
19719	Another recent study reported use of PLX5622 in a model of @DISEASE$ , mouse @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
19720	Similar to our results , PLX5622 treatment resulted in increased viral replication and lethality	1
19721	In contrast to our results , PLX5622 treatment reduced expression of MHCII on microglia and macrophages and reduced C@GENE$  cell response [ 60 ]	1
19722	While CD4 + T cel@GENE$ an improve CD8 + T cell response , the dependence of CD8 + T cells on CD4 + T cells varies by virus , antigen exposure , tissue environment , and effector sites [ 71 ]	1
19723	In models of @DISEASE$ , control of viral replication requires a collaborative effort between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 71 ]	1
19724	However , when virus replication induces activation of APCs , activation of CD8 + T cells is relatively CD4 + T cell - independent [ 71 ] .	1
19725	Viral and @GENE$ have been focused on as drug targets for the treatment of human infections ( Soong et al	1
19726	, 2006 ; Memoli et al	1
19727	, 2008 )	1
19728	@GENE$ are critically required for viral propagation because they are required for release from the host cell	1
19729	Drug discovery of inhibitors targeting @GENE$ has focused on either synthetic compounds through random screening or substrate ( N - acetylneuraminic acid ) mimics	1
19730	However , these studies have mainly been targeted against @GENE$ from the @DISEASE$ virus	1
19731	There are several inhibitors that mimic the substrate , including zanamivir ( Relenza ) , oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ; a cyclohexene derivative ) , peramivir ( a cyclopentane - based inhibitor ) and A - 315675 ( a pyrrolidine - based inhibitor ; Kim et al	1
19732	, 2013 )	1
19733	All of these compounds are based on 2 - deoxy - 2 , 3 - dehydro - Nacetylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Ac2en ) , a putative transitionstate analogue	1
19734	At present , the existence of drug - resistant strains against zanamivir ( Gubareva et al	1
19735	, 1998 ) , oseltamivir ( Gubareva et al	1
19736	, 2001 ) and other antivirals ( Tambić Andrasević , 2004 ) have spurred on the need to discover innovative antiviral agents .	1
19737	Apart from those to confirm the @DISEASE$ , no laboratory investigations were undertaken to determine if additional viral pathogens were present in the patient and contributed to the development of the BCG reactivation	1
19738	Human herpes virus 6 infection has been reported in an infant with a @DISEASE$ presenting with BCG reactivation [ 17 ]	1
19739	In addition , various respiratory viruses including enterovirus , adenovirus , human rhinovirus and coronavirus have been isolated significantly more frequently in children with @DISEASE$ than in controls [ 18 ] , although no direct association with BCG reactivation have been documented	1
19740	As viral co - infections have been identified in children with @DISEASE$ [ 19 ] , a more extensive virology work - up may have been warranted in our patient when the unusual finding of BCG reactivation was discovered .	1
19741	It appears that the H1N1 strains currently in circulation are significantly attenuated , and cannot reasonably be expected to back - mutate into a non - attenuated strain	1
19742	The greatest @DISEASE$ threat , therefore , is the introduction of a non - attenuated strain from some natural reservoir	1
19743	This suggests that a better understanding of the origin of such non - attenuated strains should be a priority [ 5 ]	1
19744	Our findings suggest that new strategies that accelerate natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses may prove useful for managing future pandemics and , perhaps in the long run , precluding the genesis of new @DISEASE$ strains .	1
19745	The study the target population comprised of all nursing staff in all @DISEASE$ wards caring for @DISEASE$ patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe District in Limpopo Province at the time of this study	1
19746	The total population of nurses working in the @DISEASE$ ward was 22 nurses .	1
19747	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) is a major public health problem ; approximately 170 million people are infected with @DISEASE$ worldwide [ 1 ]	1
19748	@DISEASE$ causes persistent infections that can lead to chronic @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 2 ]	1
19749	Antiviral drugs are not highly effective in individuals with a chronic infection ; furthermore , an effective vaccine against @DISEASE$ has not been developed	1
19750	A convenient animal model of @DISEASE$ infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective @DISEASE$ vaccine .	1
19751	The parameter estimates for each city are summarized in	1
19752	3	1
19753	When { a l } is the linear filter , { f k , l } is an average of 6 days in the past	1
19754	Far more weight is put on the current day relative to the previous 6 days	1
19755	From this we subtract an average of values previous to the 6 days	1
19756	Most of the weight from the second average comes from around days 8 - 10 in the past .	1
19757	Dealing with @GENE$ of genes or the @GENE$ they encode is often nontrivial	1
19758	In the @GENE$ database , we use @GENE$ that specify @GENE$ in a rapidly growing set of @GENE$ , and we support correspondences between these @GENE$ and those used by other annotation efforts	1
19759	The @GENE$ has two notions of equivalence : ( i ) two @GENE$ that represent either @GENE$ or @GENE$ are said to be sequence equivalent if the @GENE$ sequences are identical and ( ii ) two @GENE$ that represent either exactly the same @GENE$ or the precise protein encoded by the gene ( that is , ' ' the @GENE$ of @GENE$ in @GENE$ ' ' ) are said to be precisely equivalent	1
19760	Unfortunately , in the presence of multiple versions of thousands of @GENE$ , perfect maintenance of the ' ' precisely equivalent ' ' correspondence is virtually impossible .	1
19761	The SEED database also contains a large number of genomescale metabolic models , including 14 published models [ 28 ] and approximately 11 , 000 models generated from the annotated genomes stored in the SEED [ 29 ]	1
19762	The Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server also provides the user with an API to remotely obtain a list of the models in the SEED and to download data on the compounds and reactions in each SEED model	1
19763	The server returns the following data for each reaction in a specified model : ( i ) all data from the SEED biochemistry database , ( ii ) a list of the @GENE$ associated with each reaction in the model in a format that captures how the @GENE$ encoded by the genes function to catalyze the reaction ( as either @GENE$ or @GENE$ ) , and ( iii ) a list of compartments in the model where the reaction takes place and the directionality / reversibility of the reaction in each compartment	1
19764	For the model compounds , the server returns the data from the SEED Figure 2	1
19765	Entities and relationships in the SEED	1
19766	The entities ( boxes ) are connected to each other by a series of relationships ( diamonds ) that describe how the two entities relate	1

19770	g	1
19771	, ' ' @GENE$ ' ' ) , the series of connections shown by the gray arrow is made	1
19772	This way , any entity can be connected , either directly or indirectly , to any other entity	1

19778	As with the biochemistry data , all the model data in the server are accessible either via Perl programs or the API .	1
19779	Here we use an unbiased approach of transcriptome analysis by deep sequencing of the Culex cell transcriptome to identify genes that are differentially regulated following @DISEASE$ infection	1
19780	The results show multiple cellular pathways are involved during infection	1
19781	Using mosquito infection studies in vitro and in vivo , we determine that the ubiquitin - proteasomal system plays a major role during @DISEASE$ infection in mosquitoes	1
19782	We als@GENE$ ulex cullin ( ort@GENE$ n Cul4A / B ) is induced by @DISEASE$ infecti@GENE$ blocks Jak - STAT signalling , increasing @DISEASE$ replication .	1
19783	Secondary infections in humans are immunologically stressful [ 58 ]	1
19784	Little brown bats are particularly susceptible to a frequently lethal @DISEASE$ known as the @DISEASE$ , caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ]	1
19785	A study looking at the effects of @DISEASE$ fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus showed that bats having the fungal infection in wings had 60 times more coronavirus in their intestines as compared to fungal uninfected bats [ 62 ]	1
19786	The intestines of the fungus - infected bats exhibited a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response , which may have contributed to unrestrained viral replication	1
19787	This suggests that secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding .	1
19788	Propidium iodide ( PI ) staining was used to measure the @GENE$ content according to previous study ( Yu et al	1
19789	, 2015 )	1
19790	Firstly , the cells were collected and fixed with 1 ml of cold 70 % ethanol at 4 • C overnight and then re - suspended in PI staining buffer ( 50 µg / ml PI ( Sigma ) , 20 µg / ml @GENE$ in PBS ) for 2 h at 4 • C	1
19791	Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACScan ; BD ) were used to analyze the PI - stained cells , and at least 10 , 000 cells were counted for each sample	1
19792	ModFit LT , version 2	1
19793	0 ( Verity Software House ) was performed for data analysis .	1
19794	Records of a long - term follow up ( 13 - 60 months ) are available for nine cats and in four of the cases they were followed up until death or euthanasia [ 11 , 37 , 50 , 56 , 60 , 66 , 69 , 70 ]	1
19795	Their age ranged between 5 and 12 years at diagnosis and only one had been found positive for FIV antibodies	1
19796	Clinical presentation varied but visceral dissemination of @DISEASE$ was investigated and confirmed in all but one case	1
19797	This latter cat had a diagnosis of @DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ confirmed by serology and PCR on skin biopsies , but the potential extra - cutaneous dissemination of infection was not investigated [ 56 ]	1
19798	Four of these followed up cats were treated with allopurinol for 24 - 40 months [ 37 , 50 , 56 , 66 ] .	1
19799	Some other oral drugs ( fluconazole , itraconazole , metronidazole and spiramycin ) administered to one cat at different times were considered as not effective [ 37 ] .	1
19800	we have no sufficient evidence to clearly support or discard any of the aforementioned routes .	1
19801	The incubation of the labelled H9N2 virus with the four oviduct sections resulted in a heterogeneous binding profile .	1
19802	@GENE$ 	1
19803	We subsequently investigated the expression of @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ in the lung using the @GENE$ mouse promoterome database ( data not shown )	1
19804	At the transcript level , the expression of all factors except @GENE$ could be detected in the lung ( lung , adult : CNhs10474 ctss )	1
19805	The absence of @GENE$ expression in adult lung is an apparent paradox since this factor has previously been shown to be required for pulmonary myocardium identity ( Millino et al	1
19806	2000 ; Mommersteeg et al	1
19807	2007 )	1
19808	However , whether the lung sections sampled in the Fantom5 project actually contain pulmonary myocardium cannot be determined	1
19809	In contrast , @GENE$ low - level expression in the BXD lung data set could be detected with a mean of 7	1
19810	798 log 2 units [ background is generally considered to be , 7 log 2 units ( Geisert et al	1
19811	2009 ) ]	1
19812	Further , @GENE$ expression in the lung data set was significantly positively correlated with almost all the members of the @GENE$ ( Table 4 ) .	1
19813	To determine whether @GENE$ treatment induced the same effect in other strains of HCV transgenic mice , we analyzed RzCN5 - 15 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , which express all @GENE$ ; in these mice , @DISEASE$ was resolved within 28 days of immunization with rVV - N25	1
19814	Taken together , these findings indicated that rVV - N2@GENE$ amatic therapeutic effect on both types of HCV transgenic mice ( Figure S4 ) .	1
19815	Participants articulated that the hospital has a poor , aging infrastructure which is in dire need of refurbishment	1
19816	@DISEASE$ wards were not structured to the standard that is suitable for @DISEASE$ wards and this does not induce the productivity of nurses in the wards	1
19817	The following sub - themes were highlighted in the context of working environment , physical environment , and practice environment .	1
19818	Positive practice environment is the setting that supports excellence and decent work	1
19819	To ensure positive practice environment in the healthcare setting , it is important to consider health , safety , and personal well - being of the staff	1
19820	These improve productivity and performance of the staff , it also benefits healthcare consumers , and leads to positive health indicators for the government .	1
19821	The large proportion of @DISEASE$ cases without a detected pathogen underscores the limitations of current surveillance and detection methods and how they frame our understanding of @DISEASE$ etiology ( Box 1 )	1
19822	EPIC study results suggest we may not be detecting the full panel of pathogens in cases we currently define as @DISEASE$ nor considering the potential role of bacteria on the pathogenic potential of viruses	1
19823	Bacterial causes of @DISEASE$ are associated with more severe clinical symptoms and increasing antibiotic resistance complicates treatment [ 2 , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] , making bacterial causes of @DISEASE$ a major concern .	1
19824	Convalescent plasma therapy utilizes plasma or whole blood from people who have been infected with @DISEASE$ and recovered	1
19825	This therapy has been used during outbreaks when no particular medicines or vaccines are available for treatment [ 67 ]	1
19826	The use of convalescent plasma has been indicated to be an efficient therapeutic strategy for diseases like MERS - CoV [ 68 ]	1
19827	Studies have been carried out to confirm its feasibility and safety in treating @DISEASE$ ; however , the data are insufficient	1
19828	There are a few drawbacks of this therapy , as often large - scale screening is required to obtain sufficient amount of @GENE$ from potential donors [ 69 ] .	1
19829	Statistical analyses were conducted for the lycorine content in callus ( initiated via 4	1
19830	5 M 2 , 4 - D alone , 9	1
19831	00 M 2 , 4 - D with combination of 4	1
19832	5 M BAP ) and H	1
19833	littoralis wild plant part extracts	1
19834	The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4	1
19835	5 M 2 , 4 - D alone and 9	1
19836	00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4	1
19837	5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0	1
19838	05 )	1
19839	This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant	1
19840	Thus , for the upcoming study , this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H	1
19841	littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites	1
19842	Hence , the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H	1
19843	littoralis .	1
19844	Although colistin has been used in some studies to promote animal growth , data were not conclusive to support the effectiveness of this practice [ 81 ]	1
19845	In this study , no difference was observed between the CS treated and the control group in terms of average daily gain per day ( ADG / day ) [ 81 ]	1
19846	Also , the economic benefits of antimicrobial growth promotion in modern farms have been questioned [ 82 ] , the benefit of this use being associated with poor hygiene on farms .	1
19847	Usually required mucosal adjuvant such as @GENE$ 	1
19848	A plasmid control was generated to determine the error rate of the PCR and sequencing steps as described previously [ 17 ]	1
19849	@GENE$ were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA )	1
19850	Sequencing of an aliquot of a subset of 40 samples was carried out by Eureka Genomics , Hercules , CA using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	1
19851	Another aliquot of the same samples plus an additional 4 samples were set for 454 sequencing at the Brigham Young University DNA	1
19852	Having established a role for @GENE$ in PGE 2 - stimulated normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , we examined whether the effects of PGE 2 on @GENE$ expression occur at the transcriptional level	1
19853	We found that PGE 2 induces the expression of @GENE$ ( 3	1

19875	1g )	1
19876	We therefore conclude that PGE 2 increases cell proliferation in normal bronchial epithelial cells by activation of the @GENE$ .	1
19877	The @DISEASE$ is generally well written and certainly merits publication .	1
19878	The etiology of @DISEASE$ is unknown [ 4 , 21 , 22 ]	1
19879	However , there is a proposed relation to an infectious agent	1
19880	Epidemiological evidence for this comes from the fact that there are seasonal peaks of @DISEASE$ during winter and spring months and outbreaks have been described [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ]	1
19881	Siblings have a higher rate of @DISEASE$ than the general population ; usually cases are within the first year [ 29 ] , and can be as high as up to 50 % of cases within 10 days of each other [ 30 ]	1
19882	Recent studies show a lower incidence in breastfed infants [ 31 ] and @DISEASE$ is rare in both newborns and individuals over five years of age	1
19883	This implies a maternally derived protective immunity to a ubiquitous infectious agent [ 32 ]	1
19884	This phenomenon is similar to epidemiological findings with human herpesvirus - 6 ( HHV - 6 ) infections	1
19885	In fact , HHV - 6 is one of several potential etiologies that have been proposed as the cause of @DISEASE$ [ 11 , 16 ]	1
19886	Other notable infectious agents include other Herpesviridae ( @DISEASE$ , Cytomegalovirus ) , human coronavirus ( New Haven ) , retroviruses , Parvovirus B19 , bocavirus , and bacterial infections such as staphylococci , streptococci , Bartonella , and Yersinia infections	1
19887	Some of these agents have been independently associated with @DISEASE$ formation [ 15 ]	1
19888	@DISEASE$ particularly is associated with @DISEASE$ [ 33 ]	1
19889	Several non - infectious agents have also been proposed such as carpet shampoos , mercury and living near bodies of water [ 11 , 16 ]	1
19890	Additionally , the recent report of tropospheric wind patterns correlating with outbreaks in Japan would not be consistent with many of the viruses that have been proposed [ 21 , 34 , 35 ]	1
19891	These reports imply a relationsh@GENE$  antigen , as either a priming or inciting event .	1
19892	We used an internally controlled real - time PCR for detection of S	1

19899	Previous validation of this PCR demonstrated a detection limit of 1 - 5 colony forming units per reaction [ 10 ] .	1

19921	Nevertheless , there are other authors that consider it enough to test using only one method ( DPPH ) when good antioxidant activity values are found [ 62 , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] 70 ]	1
19922	For example , the authors in [ 62 ] found high antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh	1
19923	growing wild in different localities of Sardinia ( Italia )	1
19924	The activities changed according to the chemical composition , neverthless generally constituted by p - cymene , 1 , 8 - cineole , β - phellandrene , spathulenol and cryptone in different proportions according to the harvesting place and period	1
19925	The essential oil of Majorana hortensis L	1
19926	had appreciable antioxidant activity probably ascrible to carvacrol with positive synergism with other components [ 66 ]	1
19927	Citrus maxima Burm	1
19928	and Citrus sinensis ( L	1
19929	) Osbeck also had considerable antioxidant activities , despite the chemical differences of their essential oils	1
19930	Whereas Citrus sinensis oils was predominantly constituted by limonene , in Citrus maxima oil , several components could be identified in significant amounts in the oil ( limonene , E - citral , Z - citral and 3 , 3dimethyl - 1 - hexene [ 67 ]	1
19931	Heracleum pastinacifolium and Heracleum persicum were described as possessing moderate antioxidant activity , which main components were myristicin and trans - amethole , respectively [ 68 ]	1
19932	Three Mexican Lippia graveolens Kunth	1
19933	oils with different chemical compositions as well as their microcapsules were evaluated in terms of antiradical activities	1

19940	In spite of the fact some authors consider that the flower oils of Retama raetam ( Forssk	1
19941	) Webb cultivated in Tunisia presented good antioxidant activity , as measured through the DPPH method , the sole method used by the authors , whereby the IC 50 value was fortyfold superior to that of the reference BHT , nevertheless the apparent relative good activity reported by the authors could be attributed to the relative high percentage of monoterpenes present in the essential oils [ 72 ]	1
19942	A good activity was found by Saei - Dehkordi et al	1
19943	( 2010 ) [ 74 ] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum ( L	1
19944	) Moris from Tunisia , because the IC 50 values were close to that of BHT	1
19945	Such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl - propanoids , dillapiole and myristicin [ 60 ] .	1
19946	Recently , @GENE$ , which is induced in mosquitoes in response to @DISEASE$ infection , was found to be functionally simil@GENE$ feron in that it is activated via the@GENE$  - κB pathway and , upon secretion , activates th@GENE$  STAT pathway and an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [ 7 , 35 ]	1

19949	Interestingly , our results suggest that t@GENE$  Jak - STAT pathway is also targeted@GENE$ itin ligase	1
19950	Although , we have@GENE$ ied @GENE$ S5 proteins to be responsible for upre@GENE$ ion of Cul4 , the exact mechanism of this activation remain@GENE$ n	1
19951	WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins have significantly different protein sequences , however both are involved in f@GENE$ ion complex	1
19952	Studies are currently underway to determine whether this plays any part in the described mechanism	1
19953	Our in vivo results also s@GENE$ that CxCul4 proviral activity may be mainly localized in the mosquito midgut and k@GENE$ n of CxCul@GENE$  Jak - STAT signaling in the midgut , thus decreasing the overall viral load in the body and , in turn , the saliva of these mosquitoes .	1
19954	It is also noteworthy to stress the difference in the chemical composition of Thymus vulgaris oils reported by [ 52 , 60 ] , showing therefore the importance of the evaluation of the chemical composition of samples .	1
19955	Background : @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) are a major morbidity factor contributing largely to health care costs and individual quality of life	1
19956	The aim of the study was to test whether @DISEASE$ ( BMI ≥ 30 kg / m 2 ) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent @DISEASE$ in the German adult population	1
19957	Methods : We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross - sectional survey on @DISEASE$ in Germany and invited them to self - report in diaries incident @DISEASE$ experienced during three consecutive winter / spring seasons	1
19958	@DISEASE$ reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding - up individual @DISEASE$ were the outcomes of interest .	1
19959	@GENE$ mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission in the brain	1
19960	@GENE$ are comprised of @GENE$ and ubiquitination of specific subunits can regulate receptor trafficking and degradation in an activity - dependent manner ( Saliba et al	1
19961	, 2007 ; Jacob et al	1
19962	, 2008 ; Arancibia - Cárcamo et al	1
19963	, 2009 ) .	1
19964	Given that the median percentage of neutrophils in BAL - fluid of healthy children is 0	1
19965	9 - 3	1
19966	5 % , we chose to base our definition for @DISEASE$ in BAL - fluid on presence of > 10 % neutrophils in the cytological differentiation , as previously done by Saito et al	1
19967	[ 10 , 12 ] .	1
19968	In conclusion , we have shown for the first time that very low doses of far - UVC light efficiently inactivate airborne viruses carried by aerosols	1
19969	For example , a very low dose of 2 mJ / cm 2 of 222 - nm light inactivates > 95 % of airborne H1N1 virus	1
19970	Our results indicate that far - UVC light is a powerful and inexpensive approach for prevention and reduction of airborne viral infections without the human health hazards inherent with conventional germicidal UVC lamps	1
19971	If these results are confirmed in other scenarios , it follows that the use of overhead very low level far - UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne - mediated @DISEASE$	1
19972	Public locations such as hospitals , doctors ' offices , schools , airports and airplanes might be considered here	1
19973	This approach may help limit seasonal influenza epidemics , transmission of @DISEASE$ , as well as major pandemics .	1
19974	@DISEASE$ virus ( RABV ) is one of the most deadly pathogens known and is able to infect a wide variety of mammalian hosts	1
19975	RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica and has reservoirs in terrestrial species as well as bats ( Chiroptera )	1
19976	Although vaccination and antibody therapy is effective in treating known exposures to RABV , an estimated 55 , 000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries [ 1 ]	1
19977	RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus , family Rhabdoviridae	1
19978	The genome is composed @GENE$ NA , about 12 kb in size which codes for five proteins@GENE$ in@GENE$  N )@GENE$ in@GENE$  P )@GENE$ in@GENE$  M )@GENE$ in@GENE$  G ) a@GENE$ se@GENE$  L )	1
19979	Like other RNA viruses , RABV has a high mutation rate due to the high error rate of t@GENE$ se , thus populations of RABV exist as a mutant swarm , or quasispecies [ 2 ]	1
19980	RABV evolution is believed to be driven predominantly by purifying selection and RABV is not known to recombine [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] .	1
19981	Before the discovery of MERS - CoV , SARS - CoV was considered the most pathogenic coronavirus	1
19982	However , the higher pathogenicity of MERS - CoV was apparent by the higher number of deaths caused by this virus	1
19983	Similar to the virus of SARS , MERS - CoV infects and replicates in the human airway epithelial cells and suppresses the production of @GENE$ [ 31 , 32 ]	1
19984	However , unlike SARS - CoV , the @DISEASE$ virus exhibits wider tissue tropism [ 33 , 34 ]	1
19985	MERS - CoV can also in@GENE$ ines but lacks in productio@GENE$ ines compared with SARS - CoV	1
19986	Suggesting MERS - CoV induces delayed pro - inflammatory response and attenuates innate immunity , which suggests that MERS - CoV is more lethal compared with SARS - CoV [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]	1
19987	Primarily the @DISEASE$ virus interacts with@GENE$  receptor th@GENE$ ) protein after entering the respirator@GENE$ receptors are present on the epithelial surface of various human organs such as , the lungs , kidneys , liver , bone marrow , thymus and intestines [ 38 ]	1
19988	The systemic distri@GENE$ n of DPP4 facilitates the dissemination of virus in the human body	1
19989	Expr@GENE$ n of DPP4 on the respiratory tract is mainly on type I and type II pneumocytes , endothelial cells , nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells and a few forms of hematopoietic cells [ 39 , 40 ]	1
19990	The abundance of the@GENE$ ptor DPP4 is greater on the epithelial cells lining the lower airways and alveoli and lesser on the epithelial surface of upper conducting airways and nasal cavity [ 41 ]	1
19991	Recent findings have suggested that a prior existing @DISEASE$ might increase the chances of such individuals contracting @DISEASE$ , as @DISEASE$ results in enhanced DPP4 expre@GENE$  [ 40 ] .	1
19992	@DISEASE$ are caused by infectious pathogens ( e	1
19993	g	1
19994	, virus , bacteria , fungi ) that can be naturally transmitted between humans and other vertebrates , including wild and domestic animals	1
19995	The number of emerging zoonoses and the geographic distribution of previously known zoonotic pathogens have increased in recent decades [ 15 , 16 ]	1
19996	More than half of all @DISEASE$ that affect human populations ( 60 % ) result from pathogens that are shared with animals , both wild and domestic , and 75 % of emerging @DISEASE$ are attributed to pathogens with origins in wildlife reservoirs [ 16 , 17 ]	1
19997	Rapid modification of the environment and human encroachment promotes interactions between humans , domestic animals , and wildlife species , facilitating disease spillover and presenting a challenge to global health and food security in addition to wildlife conservation [ 18 ]	1
19998	These shared drivers of disease emergence and biodiversity loss are increasingly recognized as warranting a coordinated approach to monitor , detect , and mitigate changes in ecological conditions that may result in increased disease risk [ 19 ]	1
19999	The utility of integrated biodiversity monitoring and disease surveillance was recently highlighted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity as a pathway to strengthen conservation relevance of One Health policies and research agendas [ 20 ] .	1
20000	A total of 500 participants were administered the subset of survey items on quarantine	1
20001	Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic characteristics of this sample	1
20002	The majority were middle - aged ( 56 % ) and female ( 64 % )	1
20003	Within this sample , 4 % of participants were personally impacted by quarantine during the @DISEASE$ ( i	1
20004	e	1
20005	, either they or someone else in their home was ordered into quarantine )	1
20006	Table 2 presents the distribution of responses for each of the 15 Likert - type survey items ( from " Strongly Agree " through to " Strongly Disagree " )	1
20007	In the table , the wording of the individual items is precisely as appeared on the survey instrument ; however , for the purposes of presentation , the items are clustered according to the findings of the factor analysis ( as described below )	1
20008	As there were no significant differences between respondents from Toronto versus York , the overall results are shown	1
20009	The vast majority of respondents indicated agreement ( either " Strongly Agree " or " Somewhat Agree " ) that sufficient justification exists for the use of quarantine during @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
20010	Similarly , most respondents agreed that public health authorities and government officials should endeavour to lessen the burdens endured by those ordered into quarantine	1
20011	Likewise , there was majority support for the use of various legal sanctions , penalties , and / or coercive measures in order to maximize compliance with quarantine orders	1
20012	And , finally , the vast majority of respondents were in favour of safeguards against unwarranted and / or inappropriate use of quarantine	1
20013	While these high percentages suggest a certain degree of convergence of opinion , it is important to note that the proportion of respondents indicating " Strongly Agree " versus " Somewhat Agree " varies significantly across the 15 items , as indicated in Table 2 .	1
20014	Where P represents the population , G represents the GDP , E represents the total energy consumption ; G P represents the per - capita GDP , E G represents the energy consumption intensity , and C E represents the carbon intensity of energy	1
20015	Then , the Kaya identity was extended as follow :	1
20016	The researcher and academic participants mentioned that the government and ministry were very tightly knit in Singapore	1
20017	Leadership was very open and attentive to research findings that could be translated into better health practices in Singapore	1
20018	As the following quote highlights : " There ' s that translation angle number one	1
20019	There is the One Health angle number two , and then of course number three we also engage with basic science collaborators , to try to understand the basic science mechanisms of this issue	1

20023	Role of Singapore in Regional @DISEASE$ As @DISEASE$ is a global health issue , participants remarked that Singapore alone could do very little in controlling @DISEASE$ as a whole	1
20024	Despite all policies Singapore will not be untouched by rising @DISEASE$ in the region which can be ultimately transmitted via large imports of agricultural products and humans travelling for trade and tourism	1
20025	However , most participants mentioned that Singapore could play a role by coordinating and sharing expertise with neighboring member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) .	1
20026	Threats to wildlife conservation and human and animal health transcend national borders and require transboundary collaborations among multidisciplinary experts to mitigate them	1
20027	Regional scientific collaborations can strengthen diplomatic relationships , foster exchange of knowledge and resources among researchers , and inform regional policies to address shared threats	1
20028	This is particularly important in regions identified as potential @DISEASE$ hotspots that have largely been overlooked , such is the case for Western Asia	1
20029	To fulfil this regional gap , EcoHealth Alliance ( EHA ) , a global non - profit organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and public health , formed the Western Asia Bat Research Network ( WAB - Net , " wah - bee - net " ) in collaboration with key regional stakeholders in Western Asia in 2018	1
20030	The WAB - Net aims to promote collaborative research to improve regional capacity for One Health approaches to mitigate threats to bat populations that also facilitate viral spillover	1
20031	Given the challenges and research opportunities identified for Western Asia above , there is a critical need to link bat research with public health initiatives in order to achieve " win - win " solutions for bat conservation and @DISEASE$ prevention .	1
20032	In the pre - pandemic period , median duration of PICU stay was longer ( 19 days ) , and children were more often diagnosed with @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ ( 25 % ) and co - infections ( 65 % ) than in later periods ( Table 7 )	1
20033	The proportion of children with @DISEASE$ was highest ( 74 % ) during the pandemic , whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia ( 17 % ) , @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ ( 12 % ) and @DISEASE$ ( 6 % ) were reported less frequently during the pandemic than in the pre - and post - pandemic seasons	1
20034	Oseltamivir treatment decreased significantly in the post - pandemic period ( Table 7 ) .	1
20035	@DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ disease and the natural cycle of @DISEASE$ is dependent and maintained in a complex cycle involving ticks as the vector and reservoir of the virus and small rodents as hosts for ticks [ 32 ]	1
20036	Humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle of @DISEASE$ and are the incidental host when infected by a bite from an infected tick [ 33 ]	1
20037	Transmission through consumption of unpasteurized milk has also been reported for @DISEASE$ [ 34 , 35 ] , as well as transmission via solid organ transplant [ 36 ] .	1
20038	Histopathology was also performed on intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes from one unvaccinated cat with clinical signs of @DISEASE$ , but for which samples were not collected for PCR and sequencing	1
20039	Changes in the duodenum were similar to but more severe than those described above in case 221 , including @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and the presence within epithelial cells of intranuclear inclusion bodies which variably marginated the chromatin	1
20040	There was moderate lymphoid @GENE$ in mesenteric lymph node tissue	1
20041	These findings were also consistent with @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ .	1
20042	Proteomics analysis is a powerful technology used in a myriad of studies , including those focused on @DISEASE$ ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 )	1
20043	Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) , as a quantitative method , is a common tool in proteomics and has been suggested to be as sensitive as ( or more sensitive than ) the differential in gel electrophoresis ( DIGE ) technique ( 8 )	1
20044	Specifically , the iTRAQ@GENE$ d has been used to study a variety of diseases and has been shown to be effective and accurate ( 4 , 5 , 9 ) .	1
20045	Quality control experiments were performed using standard methodology [ 45 ]	1
20046	Genetic identity and genetic stability of the recombinant virus were assessed via polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis of the @GENE$	1
20047	Replicative capacities of the MVA vector virus was tested in multi - step growth experiments in CEF and human HaCat and HeLa cells .	1
20048	In conclusion , we have researched the evidence to demonstrate the cross - protection efficacy of N3 in hSCARB2 - transgenic mice which show greater susceptibility to natural strains B and C in orchestrating @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ and may break through the limitation of current suckling model applications that can prolong the time frame of mice age for the diseases induction especially a unique @DISEASE$ [ 11 ]	1
20049	This model might serve as an experimental model for aiding the evaluation of anti - EV71 therapeutic medicine	1
20050	The application of humanized@GENE$ l various @DISEASE$ was reported [ 39 , 40 ]	1
20051	Therefore , humanized N3 is expectable to serve as therapeutic agent to treat @DISEASE$ in the future	1
20052	It is also of interest to further evaluate whether CVA16 could elicit c@GENE$  neutralizing@GENE$ 71 genotypes in this model .	1
20053	The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against @DISEASE$	1
20054	This defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes and the acidity of the stomach	1
20055	They serve as an initial barrier that protects the host from infection	1
20056	Once these barriers have been breached , the innate immune response relies on a set of germlin@GENE$  as pathoge@GENE$ ) @GENE$ ch recognize pathogen specific molecular patterns that are sensed as a danger signal by the host cell [ 95 , 96 ]	1
20057	Engagement of PRRs re@GENE$  in the activation of several defense mechanisms including , production of interfe@GENE$  ,@GENE$ uction of phagocytosis , cytokin@GENE$ ki@GENE$ icrobial peptides , antivir@GENE$ ll as activation of leukocytes and T - cells	1
20058	Furthermore , the innate immune response harbors cellular components , such as dendritic cells , macrophages , and natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 97 ] .	1
20059	The decline in codon bias is especially significant for several reasons	1
20060	First , since the frequency of codon usage is positively correlated with @GENE$ availability in the cell [ 64 ] , the increased use of rare codons is expected to negatively affect protein translation rates	1
20061	Alternatively , Li , et al	1
20062	[ 65 ] did not notice any decrease in translational efficiency based on codon choice in bacteria , but they did see effects caused by mutation towards other @GENE$ ( i	1
20063	e	1
20064	, @GENE$ )	1
20065	Part of codon bias deals with a cell ' s avoidance of controlling factors that do not directly deal with translation rates ( e	1
20066	g	1
20067	, CG dinucleotides )	1
20068	Thus , there are multiple ways a disruption of codon bias might negatively impact the functionality of a particular stretch of any nucleic acid	1
20069	Second , even though the codon usage in ducks and humans is similar [ 51 ] , although less so for swine [ 52 ] , this might affect the ability of a virus to cross species lines ( after cellular antigenic recognition is taken into account )	1
20070	Third , Anhlan , et al	1
20071	[ 51 ] entertained several hypotheses , including that the virus was avian in origin but transferred to pigs before it jumped to humans	1
20072	Our data clearly indicate that all @GENE$ studied are more duck - like in their codon usage , although we cannot comment about a prehuman swine intermediate based on our data	1
20073	Finally , since we see an obvious decay in codon bias over time when compared to codon usage in either human , duck , or pig , it is clear that @GENE$ is not evolving toward optimal codon usage in any of these species but is slowing drifting away from optimal translational efficiency	1
20074	We concur with Anhlan , et al	1
20075	that , " the issue of codon usage seems to be much more important at least for @DISEASE$ viruses than previously thought	1
20076	"	1
20077	We present in this paper a stochastic model of chest radiograph ordering patterns and temperature as an adjunct to a biosurveillance system for detecting emerging @DISEASE$ , focusing on a potentially highimpact public health hazard such as @DISEASE$	1
20078	We show that in time series analysis of respiratory - related data it is important to capture important seasonal effects that are present in such data , as well as to consider the influence of important covariates that can be easily obtained and incorporated into the models	1
20079	We also demonstrate the importance in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of these methods , of utilizing more realistic stochastic , rather than deterministic , models for outbreaks patterns	1
20080	We demonstrate spatial homogeneity in chest radiograph data across @DISEASE$ and suggest ways in which these observations may be used to improve regional biosurveillance for ( re ) emergent infections .	1
20081	denote those time points for which there would be a greater chance of setting off a detection	1
20082	Negative values denote the time periods that would actually decrease the chance of a detection	1
20083	Except for the 0	1
20084	975 quantile of the 1 - day filter , each quantile of the filtered signal drops below zero for a period , and stabilizes at zero after that .	1
20085	Next , we wanted to analyze the distribution patterns of major viral and bacterial pathogens between single infections and mixed infections	1
20086	Fig 3A indicates that the numbers of coinfected cases of HRV , HPIV - 3 , and adenovirus were significantly higher than that of single infection cases , generating significant P values of 0	1
20087	0001 , 0	1
20088	009 , and 0	1
20089	0001 , respectively	1
20090	In cases of @DISEASE$ , HMPV , and HBoV , no significant differences in frequency were observed between cases of single infections and coinfections for each viral agent	1
20091	We also analyzed coinfection status in terms of bacterial pathogens	1
20092	As we can see in Fig 3B , the numbers of cases where S	1
20093	pneumoniae and K	1
20094	pneumoniae had been found as coinfection partners were 17 ( n = 18 ) and 10 ( n = 11 ) , respectively .	1
20095	Programming using the servers	1
20096	We recommend that the code be accessed in eclipse ( http : / / www	1

20101	These are used like any other class	1
20102	For instance , to find all @GENE$ in the @GENE$ , one does the following import java	1

20120	In this experiment , 10 layers were challenged in the H9 - group , and 10 birds served as negative controls , in the K - group	1
20121	In this study , birds were only swabbed in the trachea once , on day 4 pi to ensure infection was ongoing	1
20122	We kept handling to a minimum , to avoid disturbance of the animals and the interference of confounding factors in the assessment of laying performances	1
20123	Eggs were collected , counted and evaluated in terms of shape , color and shell thickness using an analog micrometer with a sensitivity of 0	1
20124	01 mm ( Baxlo ® Precision , Spain )	1
20125	All of the birds were euthanized on day 80 pi to collect the oviduct and evaluate the histological architecture of the organ .	1
20126	The @GENE$ ( Table S3 in File S2 ) contains a number of genes coding for @GENE$ , including @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; one of the original 24 transcripts ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ , @GENE$ [ @GENE$ ; also known as @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ] , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and four and a half LIM domains 2 ( @GENE$ )	1
20127	Of these @GENE$ , @GENE$ interacts with the @GENE$ ( present in both isoforms ) , while @GENE$ interacts with the @GENE$ ( present only in the longer @GENE$ ) ( Linke 2008 )	1
20128	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ have been shown to act as @GENE$ in response to specific stimuli	1
20129	For example , @GENE$ is upregulated at the myofibril and in the nucleus in response to stretch ( Miller et al	1
20130	2003 ) , while @GENE$ is upregulated in response to @GENE$ signaling ( Philippar et al	1
20131	2004 )	1
20132	@GENE$ has also been shown to interact with @GENE$ to antagonize expression of @GENE$ in differentiating embryonic stem cells ( Philippar et al	1
20133	2004 )	1
20134	Similarly , @GENE$ overexpression in murine neonatal cardiomyocytes represses expression of Anf , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( Mikhailov and Torrado Figure 5 A model for pulmonary myocardium gene regulation in response to hemodynamic stress	1
20135	Based on our gene network analysis we propose that hemodynamic changes trigger mechanosensory ( stretch - stress ) signaling from the sarcomere via @GENE$ , and initiate NO signaling cascades which are transmitted to the myocyte nucleus via @GENE$	1
20136	These signals initiate dynamic regulation of gene expression to enable finetuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium	1
20137	Gene expression changes may also be regulated at the post - transcriptional level by @GENE$ which could feedback to regulate Nostrin , Ttn , and Zfp451	1
20138	Collectively , these effects are predicted to result in altered contractile properties , ion handling , and hormonal signaling in the pulmonary myocardium to direct an effective response to the initial hemodynamic cue	1
20139	2008 ) ; genes which are associated with our pulmonary myocardium gene network	1
20140	We therefore propose a model whereby mechanosensing by TTN could lead to altered gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network via FHL2 or CARP ( Figure 5 ) , which might exert opposing transcriptional effects depending on the TTN isoform expressed ( as CARP signaling would only be activated by the N2BA isoform )	1
20141	Interestingly , Fhl2 had one of the highest fold - changes in expression in the left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation compared to healthy controls ( Deshmukh et al	1
20142	2015 ) , supporting a role for dysregulated TTN signaling in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation .	1
20143	With the exception of the acute phase prior to development of anti - HIV - 1 immune responses , semen , cervicovaginal , and rectal fluids from @DISEASE$ - infected individuals contai@GENE$ s agains@GENE$ v [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]	1
20144	The concentration o@GENE$ G present in such secretions varies considerably from person to person and is usually on the order of 100 to 1 , 000 - fold less than concentrations found in plasma [ 18 ]	1
20145	The presence o@GENE$ G strongly suggests that some proportion o@GENE$ s on the surface of infectious virions in genital tract secretions is coated wit@GENE$ G	1
20146	Since HIV - 1 is successfully transmitted sexually , th@GENE$ y is either of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus infectivity upon contact with an uninfected partner .	1
20147	Phylogeographic movement events among locations are modeled by a continuous - time Markov chain ( CTMC ) process along each branch of the viral phylogeny	1
20148	Although both the transitions among locations ( Markov jumps ) and the waiting times between transitions ( Markov rewards ) are not directly observed , posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [ 29 , 30 ]	1
20149	Here , we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source - sink dynamics of @DISEASE$ and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models .	1
20150	To summarize , our evolutionary findings of recurrent positive selection of five @GENE$ and gene turnover in two of those genes , together with previous observations by others ( inhibition of viral replication by some @GENE$ , viral modulation by chemical inhibitors of @GENE$ activity , pathogenicity dependent on @GENE$ in diverse RNA viruses ) argue that ADP - ribosylation is a fundamental determinant of host - virus conflicts	1
20151	Our results raise compelling hypotheses for the function of rapidly evolving @GENE$ in these conflicts , and highlight the insights that can be gained from evolutionary analyses of previously poorly characterized genes .	1
20152	We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of @GENE$ in different populations of H5N1 in particular and in @DISEASE$ in general	1
20153	The reason for choosing a protein - based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene - based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts	1
20154	To perform this study , three protein data sets have been collected as follows .	1
20155	The prevalence of @DISEASE$ infection in cat populations is commonly estimated by detection of spe@GENE$ nd DNA amplification by PCR [ 21 ]	1
20156	Over the last few decades , many studies have confirmed that feline @DISEASE$ may be relatively common in areas where @DISEASE$ is endemic	1
20157	Seroprevalence ranges from 0 to 68	1
20158	5 % and molecular rates of infection range from 0 and 60	1
20159	7 % in endemic regions of the Old World ( Table 2 )	1
20160	Therefore , a high variability in antibody or molecular prevalences is evident from published investigations , and this may be due to different levels of endemicity , characteristics of the population under study or differences in diagnostic methodologies including the cut - off titres of serology	1
20161	Moreover , few studies validated the serological techniques in cats by using feline positive control sera obtained from cats with clinical illness confirmed by isolation and negative control sera from a substantial number of cats from non endemic areas [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .	1
20162	Reagents	1
20163	LPS ( serotype O55 : B5 ) was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( St	1

20171	ECMO therapy was performed according to the guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization ( ELSO ) using ILA - active Systems ( Novalung , Stolberg , Germany [ 15 ]	1
20172	Fifty - seven patients were analyzed	1
20173	Twenty - eight patients were treated with @GENE$ ( Pentaglobin ® ; Biotest ; Dreieich , Germany ) ( IVIC - group )	1
20174	Pentaglobin is an @GENE$ - enriched polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation derived from a plasma pool	1
20175	It contains 6 mg of @GENE$ , 6 mg of @GENE$ , and 38 mg of @GENE$ ( 63 % @GENE$ , 26 % @GENE$ , 4 % @GENE$ , and 7 % @GENE$ ) per millilitre .	1
20176	As shown in Fig	1
20177	4a , most clusters were enriched in the biological processes of energy metabolism , the cell cycle , translation , and RNA - related functions	1
20178	Both @GENE$ ( Fig	1
20179	4b ) and @GENE$ ( Fig	1
20180	4c ) are highlighted	1
20181	Sixty - nine proteins in cluster A were up - regulated during the whole infection period , especially at 48 hpi and 60 hpi	1
20182	The DAVID analysis indicated that the proteins in cluster A were mainly associated with cellular apoptosis , including @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$	1
20183	Moreover , five of these proteins were classified as negative regulators of apoptosis .	1
20184	Improving the productivity and performance of health workers to ensure that health interventions are efficiently delivered is important in the healthcare setting	1
20185	Human resources for health , consisting of clinical and non - clinical staff , are the most important assets of health systems	1
20186	The performance of a health organization depends on the knowledge , skills , and motivation of individuals	1
20187	It is important for employers to provide suitable working resources to ensure that the performances of employees meet the desired standards .	1
20188	In addition to its role in cellular homeostasis , autophagy has been shown to have a function in innate immunity by degrading intracellular pathogens , including viruses	1
20189	Furthermore , autophagy plays a role in presenting pathogen components to the immune system [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ]	1
20190	Inhibition of autophagy has a positive effect on the replication or virulence of @DISEASE$ 1 ( HSV1 ) [ 26 , 27 ] , Sindbis virus [ 28 , 29 ] and @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 30 ]	1
20191	In addition , the capsid protein of Sind@GENE$ ound to be specifically targeted to the autophagosome via an interaction with the autophagy cargo recept@GENE$  , many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway , or diverting the process to benefit virus replication	1

20199	Finally , poliovirus subverts autophagy in order to generate membranous structures required for assembly of viral replication complexes [ 37 , 43 ]	1
20200	For more detailed information about the role of autophagy in the replication cycles of viruses , see reviews [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] .	1
20201	The findings of this study show that nurses were scared to come into contact with @DISEASE$ patients	1
20202	As a result , they tend to spend less time with them	1
20203	Nurses tend to neglect patients because of fear of getting infected and they provide less nursing care to those patients	1
20204	According to the study done by Valjee and van Dyk [ 2 ] , healthcare workers express a sense of physical and mental exhaustion and stress from dealing with @DISEASE$ patients that need serious attention and care	1
20205	The findings of this study concur with those of a study by Wyzgowski et al	1
20206	[ 24 ] which showed that @DISEASE$ patients often tried to expose the nurses and their relatives to their blood and fluids on purpose .	1
20207	We complemented a previously collected @GENE$ sequence data set , comprising 1 , 441 sequences sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 [ 3 ] , with publicly available sequences sampled within the same time interval	1
20208	The allocation of the sequence data into 15 and 26 geographic regions as well as into 14 air communities is described in detail in Supporting information Text S1 .	1
20209	We consider three methods of node sampling in this paper	1
20210	In the first method , we use random node sampling ( RNS ) such that all movements from a certain percentage of nodes are selected	1
20211	A more advanced form of node sampling is SBS [ 36 ]	1
20212	In this method , an initial set of nodes are sampled at random	1
20213	At the next stage , the nodes captured by the initial sampled nodes are in turn sampled	1
20214	This process can continue until all nodes have been sampled	1
20215	In this paper , we consider second - order SBS , such that an initial set of nodes are sampled and the nodes that this set of nodes are connected to are also sampled .	1
20216	analysing indoor air quality related issues in buildings .	1
20217	Because the aim of this study is to estimate how changes in ventilation affect exposures , the probability distributions of national ventilation rates in a building stock of year 2010 had to be estimated	1
20218	Surprisingly limited data of measured ventilation rates are available for European countries	1
20219	Due to this , available measured data was reviewed and a regression model was created combining the climatological and economical differences in the building stocks with ventilation rates	1
20220	Further modelling with a Bayesian subjective probability approach was used for generation of lognormal probability distributions for ventilation rates in each EU - 26 country ( Table 1 , method described in detailed elsewhere [ 17 ] )	1
20221	Table 1 .	1
20222	Background : Cyclooxygenase - 2 - derived prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) , a bioactive eicosanoid , has been implicated in many biological processes including reproduction , inflammation and @DISEASE$ growth	1
20223	We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated @DISEASE$ cell growth and progression through PGE 2 recepto@GENE$ 2 / EP4 - mediated kinase signaling pathways	1
20224	However , the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown	1
20225	We evaluated the effects o@GENE$ n an@GENE$ 1 @GENE$ 1 ) in mediating @DISEASE$ induced by PGE 2 .	1

20227	Macroautophagy / autophagy has been shown to mediate the selective lysosomal degradation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses ( xenophagy ) , and to contribute to the activation of innate and adaptative immune responses	1
20228	Autophagy can serve as an antiviral defense mechanism but also as a proviral process during infection	1
20229	@GENE$ play a central role in the autophagy process due to their ability to interact with components of the autophagy machinery as well as @GENE$ and @GENE$	1
20230	Such interactions are usually mediated through @GENE$	1
20231	So far , only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional @GENE$ , leaving open a vast field for investigation	1
20232	Here , we have developed the iLIR @ viral database ( http : / / ilir	1
20233	uk / virus / ) as a freely accessible web resource listing all the putative @GENE$ identified in @GENE$	1
20234	Additionally , we used a curated text - mining analysis of the literature to identify @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) in viruses	1
20235	We anticipate that iLIR @ viral will assist with elucidating the full complement of @GENE$ in viruses .	1
20236	The child ' s respiratory rate ( RR ) was assessed according to WHO guidelines [ 19 ] , counting twice for 1 min using a UNICEF timer	1
20237	The lower of the two counts was used in the analyses	1
20238	Children were weighed using a UNICEF electronic scale ( SECA , Hamburg , Germany ) accurate to 100 g with a mother / child - function , so the weight of the child could be determined while held by his or her mother	1
20239	The child ' s length / height was measured to the nearest 0	1
20240	1 cm using a wooden measuring board ( as recumbent length in children < 2 years of age and as height in children ≥ 2 years of age )	1
20241	Oxygen saturation ( SpO 2 ) was measured either on a finger or a toe with a pulse oxymeter ( Siemens MicO2 , Siemens Medical Systems Inc , Danvers , MA , USA ) using a pediatric sensor ( Nellcor , Pleasanton , CA , USA )	1
20242	It was recorded twice 1 min apart after stabilization of the sensor for 1 min	1
20243	The higher of the two measurements was used in the analyses	1
20244	The concentration of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was determined from a capillary or venous blood specimen using a semi - quantitative rapid test ( QuikRead ® @GENE$ , Orion Diagnostica , Espoo , Finland ) and a portable photometer ( QuikRead ® 101 , Orion Diagnostica ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction	1
20245	The test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg / L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as < 8 or > 160 mg / L	1
20246	NPA specimens were obtained using a sterile , disposable suction catheter ( Pennine Healthcare Ltd , Derbyshire , Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of @DISEASE$ in Bhaktapur , Nepal , from July 2004 to June 2007 Figure 1 Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of @DISEASE$ in Bhaktapur , Nepal , from July 2004 to June 2007	1
20247	@DISEASE$ was defined as < 70 % NCHS ( National Center for Health Statistics ) median weight for height	1

20252	As a result of its role in @DISEASE$ development and @DISEASE$@GENE$ PN has been a major target for drug development	1
20253	The direct enzymatic activity @GENE$ PN has been targeted using the potent transition - state analogue inhibitor bestatin ( ubenimex ) in several clinical trials 8 , 10	1
20254	Although bestatin inhibits nearly a doz@GENE$ es , it has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
20255	Other small molecule inhibitors of APN , including the natural product@GENE$ ucumin , have been developed and are undergoing testing in the clinic and preclinical models 10	1
20256	As with bestatin , specificity has plagued these next - generation compounds due to the limited interactions small molecules can make with the @DISEASE$ pharmacophore	1

20258	Bacteriophages are highly species - specific viruses that can infect and kill bacteria	1
20259	They have been widely evaluated in clinical trials to treat @DISEASE$ in pigs as an alternative to antibiotics use [ 144 ]	1
20260	Recently , it was reported that dietary supplementation with bacteriophages for the treatment of @DISEASE$ caused by an ETEC : F4 strain in an experimental model , was effective in reducing rectal temperature , faecal consistency score , E	1
20261	coli adhesion score in the ileum and caecum , and villous height / crypt depth ratio ( VH / CD ) in the duodenum and jejunum [ 145 ]	1
20262	However , there are several disadvantages associated with the use of phage therapy in swine	1
20263	Phages have a narrow spectrum of activity directed against a limited number of bacteria and the possible development of bacterial resistance against phages has to be considered [ 144 ]	1
20264	To overcome the narrow spectrum of activity , some recent studies have reported beneficial effects of a bacteriophage cocktail used in the feed for weanling pigs	1
20265	This combination resulted in enhanced growth performance and gut health of pigs , although the combination of phages with probiotics did not show any additional effect [ 109 ]	1
20266	Some authors have considered that the development of phage - resistant bacteria could be positive for the host [ 146 ]	1
20267	In fact , resistance to phages can reduce the fitness of the bacteria and could thereby impair their competitive capacity and consequently their ability to colonize the intestinal mucosa of the host [ 146 ] .	1
20268	The RMs were housed and treated / vaccinated at Bioqual , MD , USA	1
20269	This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH , the Office of Animal Welfare , and the U	1

20272	All animal immunisation work was approved by the Bioqual Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC )	1
20273	Bioqual is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care	1
20274	All the procedures were carried out under ketamine anaesthesia by trained personnel under the supervision of veterinary staff , and all the efforts were made to protect the welfare of the animals and to minimise animal suffering in accordance with the ' Weatherall report for the use of non - human primates ' recommendations	1
20275	The animals were housed in adjoining individual primate cages allowing social interactions , under controlled conditions of humidity , temperature and light ( 12 h light / 12 h dark cycles )	1
20276	Food and water were available ad libitum	1
20277	The animals were monitored twice daily and fed commercial monkey chow , treats and fruits twice daily by trained personnel .	1
20278	The @GENE$ involving MR766 and Vero cells was described previously	1
20279	28 Briefly , heat - inactivated mouse or RM sera were serially diluted in serumfree DMEM ( 1 : 10 to 1 : 1280 ) and incubated with an equal volume of ZIKV MR766 ( 100 PFU ) at 37 ° C for 2 h	1
20280	The mixtures were added to the confluent layers of Vero cells and left at 37 ° C for adsorption for 2 h	1
20281	A 2 × DMEM media : soft - agar ( 1 : 1 ) overlay was added over cells and the plate was incubated for 5 days at 37 ° C	1
20282	The agar overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed with 1 × PBS , stained with crystal violet solution , washed with 1 × PBS and the plates were left to dry	1
20283	The plaques in assays done in 24 - well plates were scanned with an automated Immunospot reader ( CTL Limited ) , and the plaques in sample wells and in negative control ( DMEM only ) and positive control ( 100 PFU MR766 ZIKV virus only ) wells were counted using the automated software provided with the ELISpot reader	1
20284	The percentage plaque reduction was calculated as follows : % reduction = 100 × { 1 − ( average number of plaques for each dilution / average number of plaques in positive control wells ) }	1
20285	GraphPad Prism software was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis of % plaque reduction versus a log transformation of each individual serum dilution to facilitate linear interpolation of actual 50 % @GENE$ titres at peak post vaccination response	1
20286	The medians and interquartile ranges at 50 % neutralisation were calculated for each neutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group ; the geometric mean titres were also calculated	1
20287	The titres represent the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in a 50 % reduction in the number of plaques .	1
20288	The past decade has witnessed the breakthrough of gene - silencing antisense agents including antisense oligonucleotides ( AOS ) , AOS analogues , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and the popular @GENE$	1
20289	This novel approach is based on the discovery 30 years ago that nucleic acid molecules could be used to specifically target @GENE$ and inhibit viral replication [ 52 , 53 ]	1
20290	With these new promising molecules comes the ability to simultaneously target multiple viral sequences , which would preclude the selection of drug resistance	1
20291	Mechanisms of antiviral activity exerted by CPP conjugates	1

20296	The antioxidant activity of Thymus essential oils from Portugal were the target of study in [ 53 ]	1

20299	sylvestris oils obtained from different regions of Portugal showed good antioxidant activities , even better than that of BHT	1
20300	Carvacrol , thymol , p - cymene and γ - terpinene predominated in the oils , although in different percentages .	1
20301	Mean c : p : m : of ODN À treated cultures Mean c : p : m of PBS À treated cultures	1

20305	oils and fats , linoleic acid , fatty acid methyl esters and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
20306	The antioxidant activity in such systems can be detected by measuring the substrate and the oxidant consumption , and the intermediates or the final products formation [ 5 ] .	1
20307	Standard error of the mean ( SEM ) was calculated and data analyzed using the non - paired Student ' s t - test for single mean comparisons .	1
20308	For a better understanding of the robustness of the relationship between @DISEASE$ burden and @DISEASE$ , the effect of adjusting for putative confounders was explored ( Additional file 6 )	1
20309	The studied demographic and lifestyle variables ( age , gender , education level , smoking status , contact to children , @DISEASE$ , sports activity , dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs ) did only marginally affect ORs	1
20310	However , adjustment for @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) or a summary score covering all queried co - morbidities weakened the relationship between @DISEASE$ and all outcomes considerably	1
20311	Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available ( n = 508 ) , had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ outcomes .	1
20312	Previous genetic studies examining the history of the influenza virus have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of @GENE$ [ 8 , [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ]	1
20313	They have shown considerable nucleotide diversity among circulating strains , given clear evidence for adaptive selection of antigenic variants [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] , and have shown that most of the major innovations within the @GENE$ enome have occurred via reassortment [ 5 ] , by which one @DISEASE$ strain has recombined with another strain and obtained a segment of RNA from the second strain .	1
20314	To identify the major cause of death among the tigers , the presence of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ in fecal , intestinal and blood samples of the dead tigers with @DISEASE$ was evaluated by PCR , RT - PCR , and sequencing and by inoculation of cell cultures for virus isolation	1
20315	Our results showed that only FPLV was detected in the samples	1
20316	The filtered homogenates of positive intestinal samples were used to inoculate a Crandell - Rees feline kidney cell monolayer as described previously	1
20317	6 , 7 Cytopathogenic effects were observed in infected Crandell - Rees feline kidney cells beginning 36 h post inoculation ( Supplementary Figure S2 )	1
20318	The presence of @DISEASE$ in the supernatant of the cell cultures was confirmed by PCR	1
20319	An FPLV strain , designated HN - ZZ1 , was purified from the supernatant of the cell cultures by plaque assay , and the viral genome was @GENE$ the Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Company	1
20320	The full - length genome of HN - ZZ1 comprises 4688 nucleotides ( nt ) and has been deposited in GenBank ( accession number KX685354	1

20324	Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome of the HN - ZZ1 strain and 25 reference strains ( Supplementary Table S1 ) showed that HN - ZZ1 was clus@GENE$ the FPLV branch but was also closely related to the CPV branch ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) .	1
20325	The use of @GENE$ in @GENE$ has previously been reported as a screening method [ 16 ] .	1

20331	Data were checked for normality with the Shapiro - Wilk test and homogeneity of variances with the Levene ' s test and subsequent statistical tests chosen accordingly	1
20332	We used the lmer function from the package lme4 [ 66 ] to perform a linear mixed effect analysis to test for differences of viral titers over time between the treatments	1
20333	The logarithm of the viral titers entered the model as a response variable	1
20334	As fixed effects , we used sampling week and treatment including their interaction term	1
20335	As a random effect , we added the colony identity to control for multiple testing of the same colonies ( week [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]	1
20336	Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal deviations from homoscedasticity or normality	1
20337	p - values were obtained by comparing the model with the effect in question against the model without it , using an ANOVA as a likelihood ratio test	1
20338	The post - hoc pairwise comparison was then performed using the Bonferroni correction .	1
20339	In addition to total dietary fat , the fatty acid composition should also be considered	1
20340	Based on the guaranteed analysis for total omega - 3 fatty acids and inclusion of fish oil ( Table 1 ) , Diet A was expected to provide greater concentrations of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acid	1
20341	Dietary long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids have been shown to modulate inflammation within the body , providing benefit to a variety of @DISEASE$ ( 19 )	1
20342	The underlying etiology was not defined in this study ; however , @DISEASE$ is commonly reported in feline @DISEASE$ , and the use of omega - 3 fatty acids may have a beneficial effect in modulating the inflammatory response ( 19 )	1
20343	While the duration of this study was relatively short , fatty acid incorporation into intestinal tissues can occur fairly rapidly , with one study showing significantly higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in human colonic tissue following 7 days of supplementation compared to controls ( 20 )	1
20344	Additional studies evaluating diets with titrated levels of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids are required to better understand potential benefits in cats with @DISEASE$ .	1

20348	The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms ( " bat " OR " bats " OR " Chiroptera " ) AND ( " coronavirus " OR " coronaviruses " ) by country	1
20349	Raw data provided in Table S4 .	1
20350	In addition , owing to a small farming sector , existing veterinarians had limited expertise in agriculture and aquaculture and hence farmers in Singapore were not mandated to attain prescription for accessing antibiotics independently	1
20351	Participants alluded that farmers not needing to consult a veterinarian for a prescription for antibiotics served in the farmer ' s interest .	1
20352	Limited research effort has implications for assessing the conservation status of bat species in Western Asia and impedes our ability to identify imperiled species	1
20353	A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern ( 77 % ) , and 9 % of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status ( Figure 4a )	1
20354	Yet , population trends for most bat species in Western Asia , including those classified as " least concern , " are largely unknown or decreasing ( Figure 4b ) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation	1

20357	Although evidence from the field clearly indicates the ability of H9N2 viruses to induce pathology at the level of the oviduct [ 17 ] , only few studies have investigated the tropism of these agents for this organ , in a controlled experimental setting [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
20358	Wang et al	1
20359	proved in fact , that a H9N2 virus of the Y280 lineage isolated in the Shangxii province in 2011 , could replicate at high titers in the oviduct , trigger apoptosis and cause a decrease in the number of laid eggs in the first week post infection and a reduction in egg - shell thickness [ 18 , 20 ] .	1
20360	The methods are generally well described	1
20361	However , I have a few specific issues ( see the additional comments below ) .	1
20362	To delineate the action point of the @GENE$ in @GENE$ antagonism , we tested the ability of the @GENE$ to inhibit the activation signal induced by different @GENE$ of the @GENE$ pathway individually	1
20363	The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where @GENE$ exerts its inhibitory effect	1
20364	As described above , @GENE$ is a constitutively active mutant that resembles ( 1 μL / mL ) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual - @GENE$ reporter assay	1
20365	Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates ( n = 3 ) and error bars indicate their s	1
20366	d	1
20367	The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two - tailed Student ' s t - test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P - value ( P ) was indicated	1
20368	Figure 3A ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 )	1
20369	A similar result was also obtained using @GENE$ as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , which is a @GENE$ that diverts the activation signal from @GENE$ to the @GENE$ and NF - κB pathways	1
20370	[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] When activators committed to the @GENE$ pathway were used , greater inhibitory effects were observed , as in the cases of @GENE$ ( Figure 3C ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) and @GENE$ ( Figure 3D ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , which are @GENE$ which recognize and phosphorylate @GENE$ as direct substrate	1
20371	[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Surprisingly , when a constitutively active mutant of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , with five inducible @GENE$ at Ser / Thr residues mutated to Asp , 52 was employed , the expression of the @GENE$ no longer quenched the @GENE$ - induced activation of @GENE$ ( Figure 3E ) , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of @GENE$ occurs upstream of @GENE$ activation .	1
20372	My main concern relates to the assumption made by the authors that indoor - generated PM2	1
20373	5 is equally as harmful to health as outdoor - generated PM2	1
20374	5	1
20375	There is little evidence to support this ( though it is quite a commonly made assumption )	1
20376	I would like to see some form of sensitivity analysis in relation to this assumption , since it may have an impact on the final results ( though probably not on the ultimate conclusions ) .	1
20377	All experiments were performed in strict compliance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and according to the international Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals	1
20378	The protocol was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis Animal Safety Committee ( # 20170064 ) .	1
20379	The electrophilic probe 1 has been synthesized according to the procedure of Marigo et al	1
20380	1	1
20381	The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in @DISEASE$ samples is low ( mean ENC = 53	1
20382	754 > 40 )	1
20383	The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those @DISEASE$	1
20384	Depending on the RSCU data , it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes	1
20385	Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern ( exists in the genotype - 1 of polioviruses )	1
20386	No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived @DISEASE$ ( DVPVs ) , wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus g@GENE$ elative abundance of dinucleotide ( CpG ) in the ORFs of@GENE$ oviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1	1
20387	Conclusion : The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution , especially for @DISEASE$ genotype 1 , but also have potential value for the development of @DISEASE$ vaccines .	1
20388	Inadequate vaccination coverage was identified in the @DISEASE$ outbreaks described here and was a major contributor to the re - emergence of this disease	1
20389	These outbreaks highlight the importance of adherence to vaccination guidelines for shelters , recommended by professional bodies such as the WSAVA	1
20390	Further research is needed to identify the duration of FPV shedding in naturally infected cats , as well as the potential for reversion to virulence of MLV vaccines .	1
20391	Molecular analysis of faeces from dogs displaying signs of @DISEASE$ shortly after CPV vaccination ruled out reversion to virulence of CPV MLV , since co - infection with field strains of @DISEASE$ or other pathogens including Canine coronavirus , @DISEASE$ and Isospora canis was detected [ 33 ]	1
20392	In three pups in which only the vaccine virus was detected , @DISEASE$ vaccine loads were lower than those associated with @DISEASE$ from @DISEASE$ field strains , ranging from 1	1
20393	03 × 10 3 to 1	1

20395	Cell culture and Sendai virus HEK - 293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies ) at 37 ° C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5 % carbon dioxide	1
20396	Plasmid transfection was performed with GeneJuice ( Merck Millipore ; Billerica , MA , USA )	1
20397	@GENE$ was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich and was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies )	1
20398	Sendai virus ( Cantell strain ) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) .	1
20399	Our findings represent a new model of antibody - dependent enhancement ( ADE ) of @DISEASE$ infection	1
20400	Previous studies have demonstrated ADE in vitro due to FccR - or complement - mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 wit@GENE$ 5 [ 52 , 53 , 54 ]	1
20401	Here we demonstrate that enhancement in vitro occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involve@GENE$ n	1
20402	In vivo , Ig isotype , as well as neutralizing activity , are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection	1
20403	As demonstrated recently , intrarectally applie@GENE$ b , but less so th@GENE$ 1 version , prevented @DISEASE$ following intrarectal challenge [ 40 ]	1
20404	In vitro , the dIg@GENE$ ibited transcytosis , whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6	1
20405	0	1
20406	Another study showed that , compared to irrelevant - and no - antibody controls , there was an increase in the number of transmitted / founder @DISEASE$ variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of @GENE$ b [ 55 ]	1
20407	Clearly , other studies have found tha@GENE$ G with neutralizing activity can prevent @DISEASE$ after vaginal challenge [ 56 , 57 ]	1
20408	Thus , whereas a strong vaccine - induced neutralizing IgG respo@GENE$ may protect , nonneutra@GENE$  titers of neutraliz@GENE$ n an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells	1
20409	However , whether an antibody protects , enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity , the viral strain , the inflammatory state of the exposed individual , and genetic factors - such as FccR poly@GENE$ isms - that might influence antibody function [ 58 ]	1
20410	Finally , if FcRn - me@GENE$ d transcytosis applies in vivo , our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA respo@GENE$ to vaccination - though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutr@GENE$ ing or other anti - viral response - since IgA can i@GENE$ it transcytosis , would not engage FcRn , and mediates only uni - directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions [ 40 , 59 ] .	1
20411	@GENE$ designed to enhance ( M428L ) or reduce ( I253A ) @GENE$ binding to @GENE$ were constructed as follows : briefly , the @GENE$ were PCR - amplified from @GENE$ and cloned into the @GENE$ [ 68 , 69 ]	1
20412	Amino acid substitutions were introduced by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( @GENE$ , La Jolla , CA )	1
20413	Constructs were verified by sequence analysis before transiently expressed in FreeStyle 293 cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and purified by @GENE$ affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare , United Kingdom ) .	1
20414	Many participants mentioned that there were practical difficulties in being able to perform adequate tests before dispensing or prescribing antibiotics	1
20415	Hence physicians and veterinarians tended to practice defensive medicine by prescribing broad - spectrum antibiotics .	1
20416	In conclusion , affluence effect - economic growth , was still the most important contributor to the increases in carbon emissions in urban China	1
20417	However , structural indicators , such as economic structure and energy intensity of different industrial sector , were playing significant negative effects on carbon emissions	1
20418	In the future , economic structure adjustment and energy intensity improvement at the detailed production industries should be deeply investigated , in order to make these indicators play more negative effects on carbon emissions .	1

20426	While HFold is fast , our earlier implementation of @GENE$ had its own shortcomings	1
20427	First , due to a high pseudoknot initiation penalty in its underlying energy model , many of its predicted structures did not have @GENE$	1
20428	Also low band penalty ( i	1
20429	e	1
20430	, penalty for addition of @GENE$ stems or bands ) in its energy model encouraged addition of @GENE$ when a @GENE$ was predicted	1

20434	e	1
20435	, it does not include all the @GENE$ in the pseudoknot - free structure ) , HFold is often unable to predict the known @GENE$ as output .	1
20436	Model structures of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) were built using the MODELLER 9v7 software ( Sali & Blundell , 1993 )	1
20437	@GENE$ protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database ( @GENE$ , NM _ 000434	1

20442	On the basis of the @GENE$ sequence and structure ( PDB entry 1vcu ; Chavas et al	1

20446	Regions from @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ that are not conserved in the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) were excluded	1

20456	, 1993 ; Supplementary	1
20457	To assess the trustworthiness of our in silico screening for @GENE$ in viruses , we compared our data with the already published @GENE$ listed on the web resource Viral - Zone as modulators of autophagy	1
20458	66 ViralZone classifies 180 entries related to the activation of the host autophagy , and 163 entries linked to the inhibition of host autophagy	1
20459	We found all these entries in our database .	1
20460	Besides improving PMO cellular uptake , the CPP moiety was also shown to intensify PMO antisense activity against EBOV by 10 - to 100 - fold in cell - free translation assays [ 64 ]	1
20461	These results are consistent with the findings of Nelson et a l	1
20462	who showed that PPMOs exhibited antisense activity 3 - to 25 - fold higher than corresponding PMOs while bearing lower off - target effects [ 87 ]	1
20463	The authors propose that the arginine - rich peptides enhance RNA - PMO binding affinity thereby increasing specific antisense activity .	1
20464	The antioxidant activities of other oils isolated from diverse Iranian plants were also assayed [ 48 , 49 ]	1
20465	In both cases the activities were weak	1
20466	The percentage inhibition of Salvia eremophila Boiss	1
20467	oil was of about one third of that of BHT , in contrast to the methanolic extracts of the same plant , which presented activities comparable to that of BHT	1
20468	The authors considered the absence of phenolic compounds in the oils responsible for such weak activity	1
20469	α - Pinene , borneol , camphene and transcaryophyllene were the main components of the oil [ 48 ]	1
20470	For the Psammogeton canescens ( DC	1
20471	) vatke oil the authors [ 49 ] also attributed the weak activity of the oils to the presence of β - bisabolene , apiole , α - pinene and dill apiole , all non - phenolic compounds .	1

20474	Due to the limited number of cats integrated in the study , we refrained from using a parametric approach in the statistical tests	1
20475	As such tests require a larger sample size than n = 4 , it was not possible to calculate p - values for the induction in expression of each gene shown in Figure 2	1
20476	Differences between treatment groups in proliferation of PBMCs were analyzed with a Mann - Whitney test and expression of @GENE$ on the surface of these cells were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test , where values for each cat were paired	1
20477	Relative @GENE$ expression , OD values from viral inhibition assays , ratios for FeLV provirus and Ct values for @GENE$ loads were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test with pairing of values for each cat when treatment with different supernatants were compared , or a Mann - Whitney test when incubation with supernatant was opposed to treatment with medium alone or @GENE$	1
20478	Normalized and relative @GENE$ expression ratios between different animal age groups were also compared with a Mann - Whitney test	1
20479	Longitudinal effects on FeLV viral and proviral loads were compared with each other using a Mann - Whitney test carried out with Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) values	1
20480	Correlations were assessed using the Spearman test	1
20481	p - values < 0	1
20482	05 were considered statistically significant .	1
20483	There were no matches in any of the screened saliva and fecal metagenomic pools to the @GENE$ detected in the blood or to previously published @GENE$	1
20484	The saliva pool from Amazonas had no matching @GENE$ or contigs ( S4 Table ) , while one read each from the Loreto and Cajamarca saliva pool was assigned as Bartonella by nucleotide BLAST ; however , these reported species assignments should be Table )	1

20490	Bartonella ancashensis , B	1
20491	australis , and B	1
20492	bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples	1
20493	However , because percent identity was relatively low , species assignments should again be interpreted cautiously	1
20494	Subsequent BLAST hits following the top hit also frequently ( though not always ) matched to Bartonella , suggesting the presence of poorly characterized Bartonella species present or that these may be matches to other bacteria .	1
20495	Lastly , we analyzed bat saliva and feces using metagenomics and PCR to explore alternative transmission routes , namely through close contact and fecal exposure	1
20496	Metagenomics detected no @GENE$ matching to @GENE$ or @GENE$ in either saliva or fecal pools	1
20497	This absence could be explained in that the short sequences ( 345 - 425 bp ) used as targets , and the large size of @GENE$ together make the likelihood of detecting a specific gene low	1
20498	However , the @GENE$ and contigs recovered from saliva and feces were short fragments ( 51 - 258 bp ) and showed low homology to known Bartonella from GenBank ( S4 Table )	1
20499	Notably , we used a similar approach to search for other bacteria ( i	1
20500	e	1
20501	, @DISEASE$ ) and found clear evidence of their presence [ 8 ]	1
20502	While this could suggest true absence of Bartonella from bat saliva and feces , our PCR found Bartonella in a subset of individual saliva and fecal samples	1
20503	This discrepancy between methods could stem from treating saliva and fecal pools with DN@GENE$ fore metagenomic sequencing	1
20504	Furthermore , phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these sequences were closely related to those identified in blood , which argues against these PCR positives only representing bacteria derived from environmental contamination or from feeding on prey	1
20505	PCR results further showed strong correspondence between blood and saliva , suggesting that Bartonella infection may be systemic in vampire bats	1
20506	While fecal and blood PCR results also mostly matched , we found one case where a bat was negative in blood but positive in feces	1
20507	As consumption of ectoparasites during grooming has been observed in other bat families ( e	1
20508	g	1
20509	, Pteropodidae [ 80 ] ) , this discrepancy could suggest the incidental ingestion of ectoparasites during grooming and that this does not lead to systemic infection more generally indicated by the concordance between blood , saliva , and fecal positives and their close genetic similarity .	1
20510	In conclusion , the present study indicates that the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract may represent the port of entry and exit for direct transmission of @DISEASE$ between pigs , complementing previous in vivo work	1
20511	We also show how this infection may lead to subsequent infection of myeloid cells known to be present in the submucosa	1
20512	Our data are of relevance to understanding the mechanism of direct transmission for @DISEASE$ and potentially other flaviviruses	1
20513	Although the present work does not provide final proof that the respiratory epithelium represents the port of entry and exit during direct transmission events of @DISEASE$ , our results represent an important basis for further in vivo investigations to confirm the cellular tropism of @DISEASE$ and the kinetics of events during infection of pigs via the respiratory tract .	1
20514	where L r p I ð Þ À is the average relative likelihood ; S is the total number of the divided groups ; N s is the total number of susceptible people in the @DISEASE$ group ; L r p I ; s À is the relative likelihood of the sth gr@GENE$ p ; p I ; s À is the average infection risk of the sth group ; and n s is number of infected people in the sth group .	1
20515	To demonstrate the effects of human movement on the deposition and removal of the aerosols of different size , Figure 4 gives the relationship between suspended fraction and aerosol size for case 1 ~ 3 , respectively	1
20516	Similar to Figure 3 , Figure 4 shows that the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes decrease quickly	1
20517	For case 1 , at 30 s after the injections , the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes are smaller than 10 − 3	1
20518	For case 2 , the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 18 μm remain larger than 10 − 3 until 43 s after the injections	1
20519	For case 3 , the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 22 μm are still larger than 10 − 3 even after 50 s after the injections	1
20520	So the movement of the standing person can significantly lower the deposition and removal rates of all aerosol sizes	1
20521	From Figure 4 ( a ) ~ ( c ) , similarity can also be found between the characteristics of the deposition and removal rates of different aerosol sizes	1
20522	The suspended fractions of larger aerosols decrease more quickly than that of smaller aerosols	1
20523	These characteristics are not affected by human movement .	1
20524	Statistical analysis	1
20525	Data were analyzed using the unpaired , two - tailed Student t test	1
20526	Differences at the 95 % confidence level ( P < 0	1
20527	05 ) were considered to be statistically significant .	1
20528	Comprehending the diversity of causal explanations and associated responses allows for the politics of evidence to be more deeply appreciated	1
20529	The production and evaluation of the evidence used to provide a causal explanation and promote a response is also political .	1
20530	The relationship between the @DISEASE$ and pregnancy is further implicated by social inequalities in the context of reproductive rights and freedoms	1
20531	Access to reproductive health services , such as contraception and abortion are discouraged or illegal in many epidemic countries ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 )	1
20532	Tavares & Foster ( 2016 ) suggest that Bthis public health emergency offers a window of opportunity to advance national policies and practices to ensure that Brazilian women have access to a full range of reproductive health services ^ ( p	1
20533	109 ) ( Tavares and Foster 2016 )	1
20534	This speaks to the inherent politicization of the @DISEASE$ epidemic .	1
20535	In the two papers in which oviduct infections were investigated upon experimental challenges with recent H9N2 viruses circulating in the Shaanxi province , China [ 18 , 19 ] , the most affected sections were the magnum and the uterus , and in one study the infundibulum resulted to be negative by RRT - PCR	1
20536	In one of these papers , a 60 % drop in egg production in the first 7 days pi was associated with deposition of soft - shell eggs and a sudden decrease in the content of calcium in the eggshell , together with a reduction in the egg - shell thickness , confirming an overall preference of this virus for the chicken uterus [ 18 ]	1
20537	These data and ours indicate that H9N2 viruses with a specific tropism for the chicken oviduct might have different anatomical preferences within the organ and this consistently translates into different pathological and productive scenarios .	1
20538	Our data indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine when required and for serious legal sanctions against those who fail to comply	1
20539	This support is contingent both on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and on the provision of psychosocial supports for those affected .	1

20553	The open - source software ( ImageJ ) and Microsoft Excel platforms were chosen due to their ubiquity , low cost and ease of manipulation	1
20554	We have included the @GENE$ plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript , so it is free to use by other research groups .	1
20555	A total of 57 patients with @DISEASE$ requiring ECMO therapy between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively	1
20556	Twenty - eight patients were treated @GENE$ lins ( IVIG ) for 3 days according to the manufacturer ' s instruction ( IVIG group ) , and 29 patients did not receive IVIG therapy ( control group )	1
20557	No adverse events were reported after IVIG application	1
20558	The median age of both groups was 52 years , ranging from 27 to 76 years in the control group and from 17 to 78 years in the IVIG group	1
20559	The median Simplified Acute Physiology Score ( SAPS ) and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluati@GENE$ ACHE ) score were comparable between both groups ( Table 1 )	1
20560	The me@GENE$ ACHE score in the IVIG group was 24 vs	1
20561	23 in the control group	1
20562	In 30 % ( 8 / 27 ) of the IVIGtreated patients and 31 % ( 9 / 29 ) of the control patients ,@GENE$ ACHE score was equal to or greater than 28	1
20563	Regarding preexisting disease , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ were more common in the IVIG group ( Table 1 ) .	1
20564	The diversity between the two age groups can be explained by the different triggers that can induce @DISEASE$ exacerbations , particularly allergic factors that hardly play a role in the preschool - aged children but are important in the school - aged ones	1
20565	However , the reasons for the discrepancy between our data and those published in the literature , specifically the spring peak that we clearly highlight , are unclear	1
20566	Possibly , differences in the climate and in the grass pollen spring outbreak might be part of the explanation .	1
20567	Limitations of the Study	1
20568	This is a retrospective , singlecenter study which considers only one year of ED visits for @DISEASE$	1
20569	Other settings , such as rural , non - Pediatric EDs , or community , and general practitioners ' outpatient services are thus not included	1
20570	We could not analyze the therapy performed and / or proposed at discharge , nor @DISEASE$ severity which had not been evaluated or recorded during the ED visit .	1
20571	@DISEASE$ patients are likely to transmit the disease to the healthcare workers since @DISEASE$ is an airborne disease	1
20572	This aspect of occupational risk is largely understudied , and preventive measures are frequently not in place	1
20573	This problem is more in the low - to middle - income countries , due to increased prevalence of @DISEASE$ and lack of effective control programmes	1
20574	Nurse ( N6 ) said : " we are exposed to a great risk of being infected by @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ because we do not have personal protective materials in place and hmmm the hospital also has poor infection control measures	1
20575	"	1
20576	Exo - RT - normalized viral preparations were used to infect HeLaP4 cells for 30 min at 4 ° C	1
20577	Cells were then extensively washed and then shifted at 37 ° C for 2 hrs	1
20578	Prior to lysis and @GENE$ ELISA , cells were treated with @GENE$ to remove non - internalized virus	1
20579	The @GENE$ - Blam assay was carried out according to a well - described protocol [ 44 ] .	1
20580	Primer sequences Primary description @GENE$ , the amount of colloidal gold - labelled antigen on the conjugate pad , the characteristics of the materials used , the buffer systems , the additives , and the solvents applied to ensure that the assays ran successfully over the concentration range required ( Table II )	1
20581	( Table IV )	1
20582	All @GENE$ ran against negative samples did not show any signs of reactivity in comparison to the control test strip ( Fig	1
20583	4 )	1
20584	This indicated that the @GENE$ tigen did not cross - react with other c@GENE$ odies and thus , was highly specific to @DISEASE$ .	1
20585	@DISEASE$ and the immune response are complex processes that are challenging to study , even with substantial reagent resources and mature methodologies	1
20586	Many difficulties exist for studying @DISEASE$ infections of their reservoir hosts , including the lack of molecular and immunological reagents , methods for experimental investigation , and that few reservoir species have been colonized for laboratory use	1
20587	In addition , pathogenic hantaviruses require BSL - 3 and / or ABSL - 4 containment , which presents logistical hurdles for examining the reservoir host / hantavirus relationship	1
20588	Despite these limitations , novel instrumentation , particularly those for transcriptome profiling ( e	1
20589	g	1
20590	, RNA - Seq ) and metabolomics , and development of molecular and cellular methods , provide an opportunity to rapidly develop the tools necessary for examining reservoir host responses using a systems biology approach	1
20591	The key feature of these new technologies is that they are species - independent in the data they generate , but they require significant computational and bioinformatics resources .	1
20592	All patients received empirical antibiotic treatment ( Table 6 ) as follows : a 3rd generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin was the most common regimen ( n = 243 , 96	1
20593	8 % ) , followed by piperacillin / tazobactam plus respiratory quinolone ( n = 5 , 2	1
20594	0 % )	1
20595	The change in antibiotics treatment regimen was more frequent in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv patients ( 70	1
20596	1 % vs	1
20597	27	1
20598	2 % , P = 0	1
20599	024 )	1
20600	The duration of antibiotic treatment was not significantly different between the two groups	1
20601	In our study , we did not evaluate the administration of cidofovir or adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG )	1
20602	In addition , there were no patients who received mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support	1
20603	At admission , the mean dose of antipyretics administered was higher in the Adv group patients than in the Non - Adv group patients ( 5	1
20604	52 vs	1
20605	4	1
20606	30 g , P = 0	1
20607	032 ) , although the overall duration of antipyretics was not significantly different between the two groups	1
20608	In this study , we identified adverse events after antipyretics administration , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and elevated liver enzyme , wh@GENE$ only observed in the Adv group patients ( P = 0	1
20609	005 ) .	1
20610	The etiological agents for @DISEASE$ include bacteria , virus and fungi	1
20611	The most commonly associated @DISEASE$ - causing bacterial organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae , @DISEASE$ , Staphylococcus aureus etc	1
20612	Other atypical bacteria such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and Klebsiella pneumaniae are less frequently reported [ 5 , 6 ]	1
20613	Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , @DISEASE$ type A and B , human parainfluenza viruses type 1 , 2 , and 3 ( HPIV - 1 , HPIV - 2 and HPIV - 3 ) , adenoviruses ( ADV ) and human metapneumoviruses ( HMPV ) are most frequently detected in children with @DISEASE$ [ 7 , 8 ]	1
20614	Respiratory viruses are considered as major contributors to @DISEASE$ in children and they are associated with almost 60 % of @DISEASE$ [ 9 ] .	1
20615	@GENE$ is one of these potential targets	1
20616	Imidazole - based compounds mimicking an @GENE$ in the LEL of @GENE$ compete for HCV E2 @GENE$ binding [ 111 ]	1
20617	These drugs bind E2 in a reversible manner and block E2 @GENE$ interaction while having no effect neither on @GENE$ expression nor on @GENE$ interaction with physiological partner molecules	1
20618	In addition , recent study demonstrated that @GENE$ completely protected human liver - uPA - SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes [ 112 ]	1
20619	However , administration of @GENE$ after viral challenge had no effect	1
20620	@GENE$ , which block the interaction of @GENE$ with HCV , are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry	1
20621	@GENE$ have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro [ 113 ]	1
20622	Moreover , small molecule inhibitors of @GENE$ have recently been developed	1
20623	For example , ITX5061 is a compound that inhibits entry of HCVpp from all major genotypes and @DISEASE$ infection without affecting viral replication [ 114 ]	1
20624	In addition , recent study demonstrated tha@GENE$ ody target@GENE$  BI efficiently precluded @DISEASE$ infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [ 115 ]	1
20625	Kinetic studies suggest that this small molecule inhibitor targets HCV entry during an early postbindin@GENE$ e	1
20626	CLDN1 has been suggested to play an important role in cell - cell transmission	1
20627	R@GENE$ ntibodies inhibiting @DISEASE$ infection in vitro have been developed [ 116 ]	1
20628	The results @GENE$ LDN1 antibodies efficiently block cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that a@GENE$ zing antibodies	1
20629	As me@GENE$ ed a@GENE$  EGFR and EphA2 are two ne@GENE$ ed host factors for HCV entry	1
20630	Thus , their respective inhibitors , erlotinib and dasatinib , are also regarded as promising HCV inhibitors in preventing @DISEASE$ reinfection after LT [ 103 ] .	1
20631	Physiologically , @GENE$ binds a variety of @GENE$ ( e	1
20632	g	1
20633	, @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and is involved in bidirectional cholesterol transport at the cell membrane	1
20634	The LEL of @GENE$ has been demonstrated to interact with @GENE$ [ 93 ]	1
20635	Recent studies suggest that the interplay between @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ is required for HCV entry [ 94 , 95 ]	1
20636	@GENE$ are critical components of tight junctions , which regulate paracellular permeability and polarity	1
20637	@GENE$ , a @GENE$ , is predominantly expressed in the liver [ 96 ]	1
20638	Intriguingly , @GENE$ may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes [ 97 ]	1
20639	Recent studies suggest that nonjunctional @GENE$ may be also involved in HCV entry [ 48 , 98 ]	1
20640	@GENE$ is a @GENE$ expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells	1
20641	Several studies have shown that @GENE$ is probably involved in the late postbinding event of HCV entry [ 99 , 100 ]	1
20642	As HCV circulates in the blood in association with @GENE$ and @GENE$ , the @GENE$ has also been proposed as an attachment and / or entry factor for HCV [ 100 ]	1
20643	The @GENE$ has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum - derived HCV into @DISEASE$ HepG2 cells by binding virus - LDL particles [ 101 ]	1
20644	Since cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for HCV cell entry , it is rational that other cholest@GENE$ lso have a role in this process	1
20645	More recently , Niemann@GENE$ 1 @GENE$ 3 - tr@GENE$ een demonstrated as a new HCV ent@GENE$  .	1
20646	From our investigation of all seventeen @GENE$ across a wide range of vertebrates , we found that @GENE$ is unique in its pattern of recurrent loss ( Figure 4A )	1
20647	In contrast , other @GENE$ are present in all genomes we examined , with the exception of @GENE$ , which has been lost in the carnivore lineage	1
20648	To explore the dynamics of @GENE$ birth and loss , we conducted a more in - depth survey of @GENE$ in @GENE$ ( Figure S5 )	1
20649	We found that @GENE$ was born early in mammalian evolution via a partial duplication of @GENE$ , consisting of the @GENE$ and the @GENE$	1
20650	We found that @GENE$ has been independently lost via deletion or inactivating mutations in five different mammalian lineages ; @GENE$ is therefore absent from gibbons , all glires ( rodents and lagomorphs ) , the cow / sheep / dolphin clade , alpaca / camel , and armadillo ( Figure 4B )	1
20651	Elephant and manatee have a conserved but shorter form of @GENE$ , missing the first of the two @GENE$	1
20652	In contrast to these losses in @GENE$ , we identified several @GENE$ duplications that occurred both within and outside the lineage that contains @GENE$	1
20653	For instance , although fish and birds lack @GENE$ , many fish and bird genomes have one or more additional copies of @GENE$ that could possibly serve @GENE$ - analogous functions	1
20654	Guinea pig and bushbaby each appear to have at least one extra intact copy of @GENE$ , with the caveat that in each case a single exon is within a genome assembly gap	1
20655	The @GENE$ contains at least eight @GENE$ , of which at least two copies are intact ( two additional genes are incomplete in the assembly but are uninterrupted in available sequence by stop codons or frameshifts , suggesting they are also intact ) ( Figure 4B )	1
20656	Moreover , pairwise comparisons of duplicated @GENE$ in microbat and bushbaby suggest that these paralogs may have regions that have rapidly diverged under positive selection ( Figure S7 ) , although additional sequences will be required to strengthen such a conclusion	1
20657	Coupled with our findings that both PARP14 and PARP15 are evolving under positive selection in primates ( Figure 3 ) , the gene turnover we describe for PARP14 and PARP15 supports the idea that these genes have been selected for functional innovation , perhaps in response to a recurrent genetic conflict with pathogens .	1
20658	@GENE$ from @GENE$ were aligned and mapped to the known structure of the first @GENE$ of @GENE$ complexed with ADP - ribose ( PDB code 3Q6Z ) [ 48 ]	1
20659	Figures were generated using PyMol [ 72 ] .	1
20660	Global preparedness for @DISEASE$ has been declared as the top priority of global health agencies such as CDC	1
20661	In view of the ever escalating threat of the virus mutating to a human lethal form , it has become essential to constantly monitor the molecular evolution of this virus utilizing the latest and best phylogenetic algorithms .	1
20662	Pneumococcus is an important pathogen in childhood [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]	1
20663	@DISEASE$ refers to unlocalised @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , or @DISEASE$	1
20664	Despite the availability of effective vaccines , new serotypes continue to evolve [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]	1
20665	The Hong Kong Government introduced the 7 - valent polysaccharide vaccine in September 2009	1
20666	In 2010 , the vaccine was changed to the 10 - valent vaccine and in 2011 recommendation was made to switch to a 13 - valent vaccine .	1
20667	Four ( 3	1
20668	9 % ) @DISEASE$ cases presented a @DISEASE$	1
20669	None had previous @DISEASE$ or underlying @DISEASE$	1

20672	7 % ) were bilateral	1
20673	Other signs or medical history of @DISEASE$ cases included @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , @DISEASE$ ( n = 1 ) , and @DISEASE$ ( n = 3 ) .	1

20701	In the budding yeast S	1
20702	cerevisiae , the USP46 homolog @GENE$ , and the closely related DUB @GENE$ , regulate mitochondrial function by controlling the biosynthesis of a key @GENE$ ( Kanga et al	1
20703	, 2012 )	1
20704	These @GENE$ interact with the WDR48 homolog @GENE$	1
20705	Consistent with other studies , @GENE$ stimulates @GENE$ and @GENE$ catalytic activity and is required for the physiological function of these enzymes in vivo	1
20706	Interestingly , the @GENE$ of @GENE$ can interact directly with @GENE$ ( Pashkova et al	1
20707	, 2010 ) , hinting at another potential role for these @GENE$ .	1
20708	The confirmed asymptomatic case presented in this study was a patient at the same hospital as confirmed @DISEASE$ cases and , unlike in previous studies , was neither an @DISEASE$ nor a @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 27 ]	1
20709	The low rate of asymptomatic infection in Korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of @DISEASE$ compared to the Middle East	1
20710	In Korea , most of the @DISEASE$ cases were healthcare - associated infections , and none were from an animal	1
20711	The low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epidemiological investigation conducted in Korea , including close monitoring of contacts with @DISEASE$ patients ; this helped identify almost all @DISEASE$ patients	1
20712	This may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government , leading to voluntary reports by people , active quarantine , and countermeasures to this public health crisis [ 10 , 28 , 29 ] .	1
20713	Mutation accumulation in swine H1N1 since 1918 is shown in Figure 4 , with the human regression line ( with " frozen " linage adjusted for 21 years of dormancy ) for comparison	1
20714	Regression analysis ( ANCOVA ) indicated a significant difference in the slope ( p = 0	1
20715	0001 ) of the lines of best fit for the viruses obtained from the two species	1
20716	Although it is clear that the swine versions have more variability towards the end of the sampling period , they also have a higher mutation rate in general , even after adjusting the human data for the 21 year period of dormancy .	1
20717	Information about the role of cellular profiles of BAL fluid for differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ in adult patients is limited	1
20718	Stolz et al [ 11 ]	1
20719	evaluated potential markers of @DISEASE$ in a cohort of @DISEASE$ patients with @DISEASE$	1
20720	They reported that the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the serum procalcitonin concentration are independent predictors of @DISEASE$	1
20721	They suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is 15 % ( sensitivity 84 % ; specificity 77 % ) , which is much lower than the cutoff value in the current study	1
20722	Sternberg et al	1
20723	[ 13 ] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing @DISEASE$ in @DISEASE$ patients , and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is	1
20724	20 % for predicting @DISEASE$	1
20725	However , neither of these previous studies included patients with severe @DISEASE$ caused by @DISEASE$ alone , and both compared BAL findings between patients with @DISEASE$ and those with @DISEASE$	1
20726	In the current study , patients with @DISEASE$ were included by using the newly developed multiplex respiratory virus RT - PCR	1
20727	This showed that cases of @DISEASE$ were frequently associated with @DISEASE$ in BAL fluid ( median 54	1
20728	0 % )	1
20729	We speculate that this underlies why the optimal cutoff value of percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid for predicting @DISEASE$ is much higher in the current study ( 64 % , Table 4 ) than in previous studies	1
20730	Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells - 1 ( sTREM - 1 ) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilatera@GENE$ ue of $ 60 % neutrophil@GENE$ luid is useful for differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ from other causes of @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ ( AUC = 0	1

20735	In comparison to this previous study , the current study did not include patients with @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ , included much more cases of severe @DISEASE$ , and analyzed the counts of various cell types .	1
20736	It has generally been assumed that any non - neutral mutations within the @GENE$ have arisen as selective adaptations and generally help drive @DISEASE$ toward a stronger and more dangerous pathogen ( in terms of either pathenogenicity or transmissibility ) [ 41 ]	1
20737	This was probably the basis for the extreme caution exhibited during the 2009 - 2010 H1N1 outbreak	1
20738	There is a general perception that , given enough time , Figure 7 Relative synonymous codon usage in the direct 1918 human H1N1 lineage for the four @GENE$ , after adjusting the " frozen " portion of the lineage ( 1976 - 2009 ) by 21 years	1
20739	Note that the two decreasing in frequency over time are exactly matched by the two increasing over time ( i	1
20740	e	1
20741	, non - synonymous changes are having a negligible effect )	1
20742	Also , three of these lines ( GCA , GCC , and GCG ) indicate these codons are drifting even farther away from the human average	1
20743	H1N1 might mutate into a stronger pathogen , and hence might create another catastrophic pandemic , as it did in 1918 .	1
20744	Although not much is known about @DISEASE$ pathogenesis , recent studies in mice have found that tick saliva was important to enhance @DISEASE$ transmission and the outcome of disease [ 50 ]	1
20745	Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that POWV infects macrophages and fibroblasts in the skin , shortly after the tick bite , also , other unidentified cells were shown to be infected [ 51 ]	1
20746	Interestingly , macrophages were found to be the primary target for POWV in the spleen [ 52 ] , and in the CNS , which is the main target site for @DISEASE$ infection , neurons have been shown to be the primary target for POWV in mice and humans [ 52 , 53 ] .	1
20747	Despite the considerable literature on potential mechanisms of viral - bacterial interactions that may lead to @DISEASE$ , most studies are limited to experiments conducted in animal models using select viral and bacterial strains , which may not reflect what is occurring in human populations	1
20748	Furthermore , the interactions between virus and bacteria are undoubtedly far more complex than identified in animal models , and likely consists of a complex web of interactions between different viruses and bacteria with viruses similar to that described in the URT [ 12 , 26 ]	1
20749	Even after considering these limitations , the overwhelming evidence for the existence of multiple biological mechanisms under various conditions supports our second hypothesis that respiratory viruses can alter bacterial selection in the LRT and is an important factor in @DISEASE$ etiology .	1
20750	The linear ranges of detection for the assays were determined using serial dilutions of the standards from 10 13 to 10 copies per reaction , and the limit of detection was established with twofold dilutions of standards from 100 to 1	1
20751	0625 copies per reaction	1
20752	Repeatability of the limit of detection was confirmed by making a further six triplicate reactions and further testing with the determined limit of detection with high levels ( 1	1
20753	0 × 10 7 copies per reaction ) of the ' other ' two assayed genes .	1
20754	Although the manuscript is generally well written , there are reoccurring problems , most importantly missing articles throughout the paper ( e	1

20757	For instance , in the abstract , " Based on measurements of the European Environment Agency ( EEA ) , … " and " A framework for developing European health - based ventilation guidelines … " would be preferable	1
20758	I realise that English is not the authors ' first language ( and , again , I should stress that most of the language used is very good )	1
20759	However , I think the paper would benefit from a thorough edit by a native English speaker .	1
20760	Although plasma cell infiltration as outlined above is intriguing , a similar pathological response is seen in a number of @DISEASE$ conditions such as ant@GENE$ MD@GENE$ DISEASE$ [ 85 ] , @DISEASE$ , [ 86 ] @DISEASE$ , [ 87 ] and responses to @DISEASE$ [ 88 ]	1
20761	Some , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have shown plasma cell infiltration and IgA staining [ 89 ]	1

20764	Additionally , in situ lymphoid neogenesis is described in numerous @DISEASE$ systems [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and some oncologic processes [ 95 , 96 ]	1
20765	Localized inflammation and cellular damage may lead to exposure of previously hidden self - antigens setting off a localized autoimmune cascade [ 97 ]	1
20766	From@GENE$ al studies , it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA + plasma cell infiltrates seen in @DISEASE$ represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen .	1
20767	A 7 - month old boy was admitted to the paediatric ward of Bintulu Hospital in Sarawak with a 4 - day history of @DISEASE$ and 1 day of @DISEASE$	1
20768	His past medical history had been unremarkable and he had been thriving well	1
20769	He had received BCG vaccination ( BCG - Japan , Tokyo 172 strain ) at birth , at the same hospital	1
20770	According to his mother , a @DISEASE$ had developed at the inoculation site which had then healed completely to form a scar in the months prior to the admission	1
20771	He had not received @DISEASE$ vaccination .	1
20772	On the other hand , pathogenic bacteria having resistance to pre - existing drugs occasionally cause fatal @DISEASE$	1
20773	The need to combat these superbugs mandates the development of new drugs overcoming antibacterial resistance	1
20774	Various pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae express sialidases@GENE$ zymes specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates ( Shinya et al	1
20775	, 2006 ) and play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of a number of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( Corfield , 1992 ; Rood , 1998 )	1
20776	Therefore , bacterial sialidases have@GENE$ a prominent target for the treatment of @DISEASE$ ( Nguyen et al	1
20777	, 2010 ; Woo et al	1
20778	, 2011 )	1
20779	The latest studies on sequelae of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial pathogenic factors ( Rittirsch et al@GENE$ ver , studies using a sialidase deletion mutant from P	1

20788	At 4 dpi , a time - point of high serum viral loads ( Fig	1
20789	2l ) , flow cytometric assessment revealed a trend towards decreased CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood ( Fig	1
20790	4a - d ) and significantly reduced percentages and total numbers of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the pLN of PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice ( Fig	1
20791	4k - n )	1
20792	There was no difference in numbers or percentages of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells in either blood or pLN ( Fig	1
20793	4e - g , o - q ) ; however , the percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood positive for co - stimulatory mol@GENE$  CD80 + was significantly decreased in PLX5622versus control - treated mice ( Fig	1

20795	In the pLN , the numbers and percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells positive for co - stimulatory mol@GENE$  CD86 were significantly reduced in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control mice ( Fig	1

20797	The impa@GENE$ CSF1R antagoni@GENE$  CD8@GENE$  CD86 expression appears to be tissuedependent as the blood showed no difference in @DISEASE$ @GENE$ ssing CD86 and the pLN showed no difference in @DISE@GENE$ expressing CD80 ( Additional file 7 )	1

20805	However , splenic APCs collected from PLX5622 - treated mice exhibited significantly reduced populations of cells expressing co - stimulatory molecules CD80 ( Fig	1
20806	5d - f ) and CD86 ( Fig	1
20807	5g - i ) compared with control - treated mice	1
20808	Furthermore , splenic MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells showed significant reduction in the expression level of CD86 ( Fig	1

20810	5j , k ) in PLX5622 - treated compared with control - treated mice	1
20811	This correlated with a small , but significant increase in the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , but no difference in numbers or percentages of WNV - specific NS4B tetramer staining or CD69 positivity in spleens of PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice infected i	1

20815	An understanding of the drivers of the re - emergence of @DISEASE$ , the oldest known viral disease of cats , is essential to contain this fatal infection	1
20816	We provide strong evidence of multiple outbreaks of @DISEASE$ in three countries	1
20817	There are no previous published reports of @DISEASE$ outbreaks in any of these regions for comparison , although there is anecdotal first - hand experience of @DISEASE$ among veterinarians practicing in Australia from the late 1960s to the mid - 1970s , before commercial vaccines were used routinely [ 1 ]	1
20818	Despite the widespread circulation of @DISEASE$ in Australia , this virus was not detected in any samples tested in these @DISEASE$ outbreaks	1
20819	Canine parvovirus causes approximately 5 % of @DISEASE$ cases globally , but these have been confined to sporadic individual cases , and there are no reports of @DISEASE$ outbreaks caused by @DISEASE$ in multi - cat environments [ 8 , 15 , 16 ]	1
20820	Whether this is due to viral or to host factors is currently unknown and warrants further investigation .	1
20821	Age , sex and breed data were available for 399 @DISEASE$ cases	1
20822	The median age at diagnosis was 10 weeks ( IQR 7 - 20 weeks ; range 3 weeks - 96 months )	1
20823	The frequency distribution of age at diagnosis is shown in Table 3 Males ( 49 % ) and females ( 51 % ) were equally represented among @DISEASE$ cases	1
20824	Most cats ( 98 % ) were domestic crossbred ( domestic shorthair or domestic longhair )	1
20825	Data on specific clinical signs were available for 153 cats	1
20826	The most common clinical signs were @DISEASE$ ( 54 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 48 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 36 % ) , @DISEASE$ ( 27 % ) , @DISEASE$ or failure to gain weight ( 14 % ) and @DISEASE$ ( 10 % )	1
20827	@DISEASE$ was reported to be @DISEASE$ in 13 of 83 cats ( 16 % ) with @DISEASE$	1

20839	Most strategies for developing virus - resistant transgenic cells and animals are based on the concept of virusderived resistance , in which @GENE$ are expressed to interfere with the pathogenic process of the virus in transgenic cells or animals	1
20840	However , these viral protein targeting approaches are limited because they only target specific viruses and are susceptible to viral mutations	1
20841	We describe a novel strategy that targets the @GENE$ itself , rather than @GENE$ , to generate virus - resistant transgenic cells and animals	1
20842	We functionally expressed @GENE$ which has both @GENE$ and @GENE$ activities , in HeLa cells and transgenic mice	1
20843	We found that the transgenic cells and mice acquired complete resistance to two DNA viruses ( HSV and PRV ) without accumulating the virus , and showed delayed onset of disease symptoms	1
20844	The antiviral effects against DNA viruses demonstrated in this study were caused by ( 1 ) @GENE$ activity of @GENE$ in the nucleus , which inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and ( 2 ) @GENE$ activity in the cytoplasm , which blocked protein translation	1

20890	The genomes were generated by sequencing overlapping PCR amplicons spanning the entire genome	1
20891	These are the first reported complete genome sequences of locally circulating HMPV strains obtained directly from clinical samples in Africa	1

20897	The samples were separated on polyacrylamide gel and Western blot was performed using @GENE$ and @GENE$ .	1
20898	However and generally we find other tests being utilized along with ABTS for evaluating free radical - scavenging capacity	1
20899	For example , Satureja intricata Lange had ability for scavenging both DPPH and ABTS , whereas Satureja obovata Lag	1
20900	did not possess such ability [ 77 ]	1
20901	This behaviour could be attributed to the presence of thymol and its precursors p - cymene and γ - terpinene , along with borneol in Satureja intricata	1
20902	The essential oils of Artemisia herba - alba already reported above as possessing little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation [ 45 ] , when evaluated in terms of free radical scavenging , the oils continued to have weak activity	1
20903	In this case and in contrast to other works [ 44 , 51 ] , the essential oil of Artemisia herba - alba was not effective either against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger .	1
20904	where b is the infection transmission rate and N is the total population size	1
20905	The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function , P ( t ) , and as such the average infectious period , denoted by 1 / c , is given by R ' 0 PðtÞdt [ 21 ]	1
20906	The probability density function of the infectious period , p ( t ) , is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function , ÀdP ( t ) / dt	1
20907	Different functional forms for @GENE$ give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model	1
20908	For example , setting p ( t ) equal to e Àct / c recovers the classical exponentially distributed @GENE$ model	1
20909	More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing @GENE$ to be a @GENE$ [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] , with parameters c and n ( see Protocol S1 )	1
20910	An alternative ( and computationally efficient ) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nc being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses	1
20911	The advantage of this formalism is that when n ¼ 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model , which has a large variance , while as n ! ' we obtain a fixed infectious period	1
20912	The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A ; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data .	1
20913	When available , results of allergy and reflux testing , data on anti - reflux therapy prior to FOB + BAL , familial history of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , a history of exposure to tobacco smoke , and the response to antibiotic treatment were recorded	1
20914	Children with positive skin prick tests and / or elevated specific immunoglobulin E in blood were considered allergic	1
20915	@DISEASE$ was assessed by a positive 24 hour - oesophageal pH measurement , interpreted according to gastroenterological criteria [ 11 ] .	1
20916	For pseudoknotted structures , using @GENE$ as input is far superior to using @GENE$ as input , for both HFold and Iterative HFold	1
20917	This appears to be because MFE structures predicted by SimFold tend to have more @GENE$ than the true pseudoknot free structure , G big , so that HFold and Iterative @GENE$ are unlikely to add @GENE$ to the input structure	1
20918	For pseudoknotfree structures , using @GENE$ as input is somewhat better than using @GENE$ , but the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant .	1
20919	In this paper we use the @GENE$ V2	1
20920	0 DP09 [ 36 ] energy parameters in our implementation of Iterative HFold	1
20921	To investigate the degree to which the energy model may be causing mis - predictions by @GENE$ V2	1
20922	0 or Iterative HFold , we considered the degree to which the maximum accuracy structures produced by these methods , i	1
20923	e	1
20924	, the structure with highest F - measure , is better than the @GENE$ free energy structures	1
20925	Similarly , if we compare the maximum accuracy structure output by Iterative HFold with the minimum free energy structure , whether given @GENE$ or the first 50 suboptimal structures to Iterative HFold as input , the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals of average F - measure also show improvement - see Table 6	1
20926	The difference in improvements is significant in all but one case , namely Iterative HFold on @GENE$ as input for @GENE$ of the HK - PK data set	1
20927	We conclude that improvements on the energy parameter values for pseudoknotted structures may further improve accuracy of both @GENE$ and Iterative HFold .	1
20928	It is also important to note that research and research publications sometimes tends to be biased and may marginalize the narratives by or representing the most vulnerable poor populations and political topics	1
20929	Furthermore , social science literature that did not fit the definition of politics as articulated for the purposes of this review was excluded	1
20930	A future review might seek to unpack the themes that emerge from this additional literature .	1
20931	The Liberian culture was blamed not only for causing the epidemic but for interfering with control measures	1
20932	Jones ( 2014 ) criticizes this Bculturalist epidemiology ^ ( pg	1
20933	1 ) that overlooks the wider global forces that promote the spread of @DISEASE$ , instead exoticizing Liberian culture to attribute responsibility ( Blair et al	1
20934	2017 )	1
20935	For example , traditional burial practices and the consumption of bush meat were identified as key etiological factors to the @DISEASE$ epidemic	1
20936	Some analysts even suggest that these cultural practices , in addition to local distrust of authorities may have obstructed interventions ( Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c ; Cordner et al	1
20937	2017 )	1
20938	Therefore , population behaviors , such as education and safe burials and cremations , were proposed as targets for intervention ( Hagan et al	1
20939	2015 ; Alexander et al	1
20940	2015 ) .	1
20941	Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was carried out to analyze the major trend in codon usage pattern in different genomes of @DISEASE$ ( excluding non - coding regions )	1
20942	It is a statistical method that performs linear mapping to extract optimal features from an input distribution in the mean squared error sense and can be used by self - organizing neural networks to form unsupervised neural preprocessing modules for classification problems [ 6 ]	1
20943	In order to minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage , each ORF@GENE$ represented as a 59 @GENE$ ach dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon excluding Met , Trp@GENE$  three sto@GENE$ inear regression analysis was used to find the correlation between codon usage bias and gene length	1
20944	Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationship between codon usage bias and synonymous codon usage pattern	1
20945	This analysis is implemented based on the Spearman ' s rank correlation analysis way .	1
20946	Pigs are highly susceptible to @DISEASE$ and rapidly develop @DISEASE$ , which can last for a few days , during which they can transmit the virus to mosquitoes ( 4 , 6 )	1
20947	Infected pigs normally present mild @DISEASE$ , but the infection of pregnant sows can cause @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ ( 7 )	1
20948	Although @DISEASE$ infection is typically mosquito borne , contact transmission and high susceptibility to @DISEASE$ have been described ( 8 )	1
20949	Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that @DISEASE$ can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs , independently of the route of inoculation , for a period of 5 days , with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of @DISEASE$ ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 )	1
20950	Furthermore , mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions ( 13 )	1
20951	These findings represent a warning that @DISEASE$ could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito - free periods	1
20952	In fact , a reemergence of @DISEASE$ in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan ( 14 )	1
20953	It is also important to note that vector - free transmission of mosquito - borne flaviviruses is not restricted to @DISEASE$ and pigs	1
20954	Several species , including macaques , mice , hamsters , guinea pigs , rats , and squirrel hamsters , are susceptible to oronasal infection with @DISEASE$ ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 )	1
20955	In addition , nonvector - borne transmission has been described for other @DISEASE$ ( 18 , 19 )	1
20956	Examples are @DISEASE$ ( ZIKV ) ( 20 , 21 ) , @DISEASE$ ( WNV ) ( 22 , 23 ) , @DISEASE$ ( SLEV ) ( 24 ) , @DISEASE$ virus ( BAGV ) ( 25 ) , @DISEASE$ virus ( TMUV ) ( 26 ) , and @DISEASE$ ( WESSV ) ( 27 ) .	1

20965	The randomization was balanced by site , presence of @DISEASE$ , and the owner reported weekly average number of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ episodes	1
20966	Randomization was conducted with an internally developed balance and assignment program through an electronic case record form	1

20983	Target cells were incubated with an equal amount of viral particles at 4 ° C , extensively washed and then shifted at 37 ° C to induce virus entry into the cell	1
20984	After 2 hours , cells were treated with @GENE$ to remove extracellular virus and the amount of intracellular @GENE$ was determined by ELISA	1
20985	Under these conditions , all @GENE$ - HIV - 1 particles presented an entry defect , indicating that @GENE$ interfered with the ability of virion particles to enter target cells ( from 40 % to 70 % Figure 6B )	1
20986	To further support this argument , viruses were produced in the presence of @GENE$	1
20987	This protein is incorporated into virion particles and is released in the cytoplasm of target cells after viral - to - cell membrane fusion where it can cleave a fluorescent dye [ 44 ]	1
20988	When viral particles incorporating @GENE$ were analyzed a similar decrease in entry was measured for virions incorporating @GENE$ as compared to WT ( Figure 6C , from 50 to 70 % )	1
20989	Although this defect appeared more pronounced in the case of @GENE$ than of @GENE$ / 3 , this difference did not reach statistical significance .	1
20990	To quantify the relative plaque sizes of the different CVB3 mutants , Vero cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and grown to confluence	1
20991	Approximately 30 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) of each mutant was diluted in a 2	1
20992	5 mL inoculum of serum - free DMEM	1
20993	The media on the Vero cells was aspirated and replaced with the 2	1
20994	5 mL inoculum containing the virus	1
20995	The inoculum was incubated on the cells for approximately 30 min at 37 • C	1
20996	After 30 min , an overlay of 8 mL 0	1
20997	8 % agarose was added to each dish	1
20998	The dishes were incubated at 37 • C for 2 days to allow plaque formation	1
20999	The cells were fixed with 4 % formalin and the agarose plugs removed	1
21000	The fixed cells were stained with crystal violet	1
21001	Plaque size was determined using ImageJ software ( Version 1	1
21002	51k ) [ 29 ] .	1
21003	@GENE$ - HIV - 1 particles are impaired at entry , the same step inhibited when @GENE$ are present in the opposite topology , i	1
21004	e	1
21005	in target cell membranes [ 17 , 26 ]	1
21006	At present , the mechanism through which @GENE$ block endosomal fusion of incoming viruses remains controversial [ 25 , 26 ] and this mechanism could be molecularly distinct from the one at play here	1
21007	Multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain the antiviral effect of @GENE$ in target cells	1
21008	@GENE$ have been reported to increase the intracellular levels of cholesterol [ 25 ] and variations in cholesterol have been associated to defects in membrane fusion , viral production and are likely to play an important role in multiple physiological processes [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] .	1
21009	In search of optimal chromatographic conditions , different mobile phase compositions were investigated	1
21010	The mobile phases were acetonitrile - deionised distilled water ( ddH 2 O ) at ratios of 40 : 60 v / v , 35 : 75 v / v , 30 : 70 v / v , 25 : 75 v / v , 20 : 80 v / v , and 15 : 85 v / v , each at a flow rate of 1 mL / min	1
21011	All these mobile phases resulted in peak splitting and tailing	1
21012	The retention time was longer than 5 min	1
21013	This phenomenon may be due to the ionization of the compound in the column .	1
21014	The transmission potential of honeybee viruses between bees and other ecosystem service providing insects has received considerably less attention [ 16 ]	1
21015	It appears as if cross - species transmission	1
21016	Given that EV - D68 replication and production is dependent on the cell cycle , we next asked whether EV - D68 might have the ability to manipulate the host cell cycle to facilitate its own production	1
21017	@DISEASE$ cells were infected with EV - D68 Fermon stain at an MOI of 0	1
21018	8 , and the cells were collected for cell cycle distribution analysis after 24 h	1
21019	An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 was observed in EV - D68 - infected cells ( 45	1
21020	20 ± 0	1
21021	14 % ) as compared to mock - infected cells ( 36	1
21022	50 ± 0	1
21023	76 % ) ( 23	1
21024	84 % increase ; P < 0	1
21025	01 ; Figure 2A )	1
21026	Therefore , EV - D68 itself can manipulate the host cell to accumulate preferentially at G0 / G1 phase rather than at G2 / M , which favors viral production .	1
21027	One must be cautious when interpreting the literature on bat defenses	1
21028	The order Chiroptera contains more than 1200 species [ 17 ]	1
21029	Due to this diversity , the information obtained from one species may not apply to others	1
21030	For instance , in the black flying fox ( Pteropus alecto ) , the @GENE$ is contracted , whereas in the Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) , this locus is expanded [ 18 , 19 ]	1
21031	Other examples are discussed later in this review .	1
21032	Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 @GENE$ interaction would occur in the cytoplasm	1
21033	Although @GENE$ is an @GENE$ , which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum , recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of @GENE$ protein exploits the ER retro - translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm , where it is detected as a @GENE$	1
21034	Importantly , in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates , retrotranslocated @GENE$ protein is not immediately degraded by the @GENE$ present in the cytoplasm [ 16 ]	1
21035	Thus , cytoplasm localized deglycosylated @GENE$ may be able to associate with @GENE$	1
21036	Indeed , experiments done using @GENE$ suggest that non - glycosylated , cytoplasm localized @GENE$ is capable of associating with @GENE$ and inhibiting @GENE$ activity	1
21037	Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism .	1
21038	By blocking the deubiquitination of @GENE$ , the DIs P22077 and @GENE$ should also increase steady state levels of @GENE$ and thus its entry into the @DISEASE$	1
21039	To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiqui@GENE$  Ub @GENE$ smids , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs @GENE$ utant , which was shown to display elevated leve@GENE$ d Gag , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ]	1
21040	To avoid rapid proteasomal degradati@GENE$ ecies following DI treatment , cells were incubated wit@GENE$ asome inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis	1
21041	After immunoprecipitation@GENE$ odies , western blot analyses were performe@GENE$ ecies were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 )	1
21042	Following co - expressi@GENE$ ag w@GENE$  - Ub , a faint patte@GENE$ ecies was observed , which most likely repre@GENE$ d Gag	1
21043	Upon treatment with 14 μM PR - 619 or 20 μM P22077 , the intensity o@GENE$  - Ub - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels o@GENE$ utant	1
21044	Similar amoun@GENE$ d Gag were confirmed by anti - CA staining	1
21045	Thus , treatment with P220@GENE$ - 619 enhances polyubiquitinati@GENE$ f Gag	1
21046	In our previous studies , we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentati@GENE$ top@GENE$ cules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the ent@GENE$ f Gag into the @DISEASE$ [ 26 , 32 , 48 , 67 ]	1
21047	To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation , we measured the pres@GENE$ ed @GENE$ I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [ 26 , 32 , 33 , 48 ]	1
21048	After transfec@GENE$ ion plasmid into He cells , which stably express the murine MHC - I allotype H2 - K b ( referred to as HeLa - K b cells ) [ 68 ] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration - dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 ( Figure 9A )	1
21049	Addition of 10 μM P22077 or 7 μM PR - 619 led to a 3 - fold increase in SL presentation , while addition of 14 μM PR - 619 caused an even 10 - fold increase in the SL presentation	1
21050	To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2 - K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment , the amount of total H2 - K b was quantified , showing similar amounts of H2 - K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR - 619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B )	1
21051	In our previous studies , we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [ 26 , 32 , 48 , 67 ]	1
21052	To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation , we measured the presentation of Gag - derived epitopes on MHC - I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [ 26 , 32 , 33 , 48 ]	1
21053	After transfection of the syngag - SL expression plasmid into HeLa cells , which stably express the murine MHC - I allotype H2 - K b ( referred to as HeLa - K b cells ) [ 68 ] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration - dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 ( Figure 9A )	1
21054	Addition of 10 µM P22077 or 7 µM PR - 619 led to a 3 - fold increase in SL presentation , while addition of 14 µM PR - 619 caused an even 10 - fold increase in the SL presentation	1
21055	To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2 - K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment , the amount of total H2 - K b was quantified , showing similar amounts of H2 - K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR - 619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B )	1
21056	Taken together , these results indicate that DIs , especially those targeting USP7 and USP47 , not only inhibit HIV - 1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC - I pathway .	1
21057	Despite the tremendous effort that has been made to improve the classical , combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) , which mainly blocks @GENE$ , there is an increasing risk for treatment failure resulting from drug resistance , incompliance , and adverse effects	1
21058	While there is still a great medical need for continuous development of novel antiretroviral drugs [ 85 ] , the focus is currently on cellular targets that are genetically a million times more stable and thus harbor a much lower risk of drug resistance [ 86 , 87 ]	1
21059	Small molecules , which affect cellular targets , offer a treatment alternative for interruption of cART in case of drug intolerance or development of multi - resistant HIV - 1 variants	1
21060	In this study , we could provide first evidence that the DIs P22077 and PR - 619 not only block the replication of the HIV - 1 T cell culture adapted molecular clone NL4 - 3 , but also of the multi - resistant field isolate HIV - 1 4lig7 , which possesses resistance against all NRTIs and most of the protease inhibitors used in cART [ 50 , 51 ]	1
21061	Moreover , we could demonstrate that structural treatment with DIs @GENE$ and PR - 619 on day 1 and 3 post infection can completely block spread of infection with similar efficacy as permanent treatment and without affecting cell viability	1
21062	This indicates that a complete and comprehensive block in the production of progeny viruses , occurring early during spread of infection in the cell culture , must have been achieved by DI treatment that efficiently enables eradication of virus replication	1
21063	One explanation for this observation might be the reduced infectivity of virions released under DI treatment , which is most likely due to impaired @GENE$ processing	1
21064	However , additional impact of DIs on @GENE$ packaging , or the incorporation of the @GENE$ into budding virions , as well as on the activities of @GENE$ , like @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ , might also account for this phenomenon .	1
21065	However , transcriptional targets apart from @GENE$ itself have not yet been found	1
21066	@GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a critical component of the sonic hedgehog ( @GENE$ ) signaling pathway ( Christ et al	1
21067	2012 )	1
21068	There is some evidence that @GENE$ can shed its intracellular domain , which then shuttles to the nucleus where it may interact with as - yet - unidentified @GENE$ ( Li et al	1
21069	2008 )	1
21070	However , a role for @GENE$ has not yet been identified in either heart or lung	1
21071	The @GENE$ contained six genes , only two of which were expressed in adult lung ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ; Table 3 )	1
21072	Of these , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was a likely candidate modifier based on its role as a key integrator of myocyte signaling pathways ( Linke 2008 ; Miller et al	1
21073	2004 )	1
21074	Therefore , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ were analyzed further .	1
21075	To determine whether rVV - N25 treatment affected @GENE$ production , we measured serum levels of @GENE$ after rVV immunization	1
21076	The serum levels of these @GENE$ increased in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice ( Figure 6A , Figure S5 )	1
21077	Immunization with rVV - N25 affected serum levels of @GENE$ in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice and caused a return to the @GENE$ levels observed in wild - type untreated mice ( Figure 6A )	1
21078	In wild - type mice , the @GENE$ levels remained unchanged after immunization ( Figure 6A )	1
21079	These results indicated that @GENE$ were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice .	1
21080	A Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is in the same building and intensivists ' consultancies are available as needed .	1
21081	In summary , we demonstrated that @GENE$ interacts with @GENE$ and negatively modulates the CSFV growth	1
21082	The possible mechanism of the negative effect of @GENE$ on the CSFV growth is that @GENE$ interacts with the @GENE$ and inhibits its activity	1
21083	Further studies are needed to define the detailed interplay among @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the life cycle of CSFV .	1
21084	The @GENE$ or @GENE$ was amplified and cloned into the @GENE$ to generate @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
21085	Subsequently , the @GENE$ were linearized by @GENE$ and transcribed in vitro using a RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system ( catalog no	1
21086	P1300 ; Promega ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions	1
21087	The resulting RNA was labeled with @GENE$ ( catalog no	1
21088	A14216 ; Baoman , Shanghai , China ) using a mercury vapor lamp for 30 min	1
21089	HEK293T cells grown on 6 - well plates were transfected with the indicated @GENE$ ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ ) and lyzed with the lysis buffer	1
21090	The lysate collected from two wells of the 6 - well plate ( lyzed with 150 µL of lysis buffer per well ) was incubated with the @GENE$ ( 2 µg ) for 4 h at 4 [UNK] C , and then incubated with streptavidin beads ( catalog no	1
21091	11205D ; Invitrogen ) for another 30 min at room temperature	1
21092	The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the @GENE$ ( 1 : 1000 )	1
21093	For competitive RNA pulldown , the cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of unlabeled @GENE$ ( 0 , 0	1
21094	75 , 1	1
21095	5 and 3 µg ) for 1 h at 4 [UNK] C and then incubated with the @GENE$ and streptavidin beads	1
21096	The experiments were carried out in triplicates .	1
21097	There are several shortfalls of the study including ( a ) shorter study period , ( b ) low number of both symptomatic and asymptomatic specimens , ( c ) exclusion of coronavirus from viral panel selected for RT - qPCR assay , ( d ) lack of some clinical information and follow - up study , ( e ) use of nasal swabs instead of nasopharyngeal swabs for specimen collection , ( f ) exclusion of ARI - causing fungal pathogen detection	1
21098	Thirty - five out of 200 specimens remained undetected of any viral or bacterial pathogens	1
21099	It is highly likely that the inclusion of fungal pathogen detection system and the addition of coronavirus in the viral panel would increase the rate of pathogen detection to some extent	1
21100	In addition , the detection rate of bacterial pathogens could have been higher if PCR or qPCR had been used instead of culture method as the former one has higher sensitivity	1
21101	However , we wanted to isolate all types of possible organisms and the use of specific primers would have confined the range of organisms	1
21102	For example , E	1
21103	agglomerans which has been rarely reported as a causative agent of @DISEASE$ was isolated in 4 ( 2 % ) nasal swab specimens in this study	1
21104	The nasopharyngeal aspirate ( NPA ) has been considered to be the best sampling technique , but the procedure of obtaining an NPA specimen is uncomfortable and often frightening for young children	1
21105	It is also unpleasant for the medical staff , who have to carry out the procedure with a struggling , crying , and coughing child	1
21106	However , pathogen detection sensitivity did not differ significantly between nasal swab and NPA approaches of specimen collection when sensitive real - time PCR method was used to detect pathogens [ 58 , 59 ]	1
21107	In the study , only those viruses that are frequently detected in Bangladesh were listed in@GENE$ anel	1
21108	Even with these limitations , the study provides important preliminary data that can be used for more focused surveys in a larger population	1
21109	The frequency of @DISEASE$ should be taken into account by pediatricians to avoid the irrational use of antibiotics .	1
21110	The Sapling Server is architected such that new features can be added quickly	1
21111	New data tables may be added as updates to the XML metadata , which is processed by a special load program to build the initial @GENE$	1
21112	The list of services offered is maintained on the server , so that client software does not need to be updated in order for users to access new features	1
21113	A web application that converts general database queries to @GENE$ helps speed implementation of new functions .	1
21114	A similar approach has been adopted for rapid , real - time analysis of metagenomics samples , which might elsewhere take days or months for BLAST - based analysis	1
21115	This real - time metagenomics analysis ( URL : http : / / edwards	1
21116	sdsu	1
21117	edu / rtmg ) can be performed on computers or cellular phones [ 39 ] .	1
21118	Is it feasible that natural selection might fail to remove a large number of deleterious mutations ? It is well known that numerous factors can cause a breakdown in the selective removal of deleterious mutations	1
21119	These factors include a high mutation rate , a high rate of random loss , limited sexual recombination , genetic bottlenecking , and mutations with very small fitness effects	1
21120	All of these factors should be especially pronounced in an @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and all of these are either previously known or documented here	1
21121	The genetic changes in H1N1 appear non - directional and are distributed quite uniformly across the genome ( Additional file 3 ) , consistent with an accumulation of low - impact deleterious mutations	1
21122	Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis are already recognized as a threat to any @DISEASE$	1
21123	These facts , combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain extinction , all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations .	1
21124	Optimised assays were tested for pathogen specificity by seeding six qPCR reactions with DNA extracted from tissue infected with @DISEASE$ ( two tissue samples ) and @DISEASE$ virus ( two tissue samples ) and individual cell culture isolates that contained canine adenovirus 1 and 2	1
21125	The results of the new assays were compared with the SQPV PCR assay ( Atkin et al	1
21126	2010 ) and TEM methods used to identify SADV ( Everest et al	1
21127	2008 )	1
21128	In the absence of a gold standard for both target pathogens , a test of agreement ( Pfeiffer 2010 ) was performed to compare whether the assays similarly reported presence or absence of virus	1
21129	When comparing qPCR assays , the quantitative values were investigated for correlation using a Pearson ' s correlation	1
21130	All statistical analyses ( including generating figures ) were performed using R v	1

21135	@DISEASE$ can damage and impede the repair of respiratory epithelial cells leading to reduced mucociliary clearance	1
21136	Consequently , bacteria can more easily enter the lungs to cause @DISEASE$ [ 75 ]	1
21137	Many of the virus - bacteria interaction mechanisms involve viral compromise of the innate immune system	1
21138	These include impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] and neutrophils , which are necessary for bacterial clearance , mediated by induction of type I interferons@GENE$ itization to Toll - like recept@GENE$ gands [ 105 ]	1
21139	Detailed descriptions of potential biological pathways involved in these mechanisms are discussed in earlier reviews by Robinson et al	1
21140	[ 55 ] and McCullers [ 9 ]	1
21141	Finally , excessive inflammation in the lungs due to virus - initiated exacerbation of inflammatory media@GENE$ em@GENE$ an c@GENE$  damage [ 6 ] , which increases susceptibility to secondary @DISEASE$ .	1
21142	Among the currently available inflammatory markers , @GENE$ is one of the best indicators of @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
21143	The usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements has@GENE$ he diagnosis , severity assessment , and follow - up of patients with @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
21144	In the current study , the AUC of serum procalcitonin concentration for predicting @DISEASE$ ( @GENE$ smaller than those of total WBC ( AUC = 0	1
21145	855 ) and neutrophil ( AUC = 0	1
21146	837 ) counts	1
21147	The combination of BAL fluid WBC counts and serum procalcitonin concentration tended to improve the diagnostic accu@GENE$ l	1
21148	This indicates that combinations of these markers can be useful to rule - out ( BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $ 0	1
21149	71 ng / mL with a sensitivity o@GENE$ ive likelihood ratio of 0	1

21151	1 mg / dl with a specif@GENE$ ive likelihood ratio of 8	1
21152	63 ) @DISEASE$	1
21153	Diagnostic accuracy could be further improved if BAL fluid cellular profiles are interpreted alongside clinical presentations , radiographic studies , and other relevant test results	1
21154	Using this approach , it might be possible to identify patients who can be managed without antibacterial agents or those who require antiviral agents .	1
21155	During the last 10 years there has been an increase of @DISEASE$ in the USA with approximately 100 reported cases [ 54 , 55 ]	1
21156	The recent rise in incidence could be due to increased surveillance and diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , or it may represent a true emergence of the disease in endemic areas , or both [ 55 ]	1
21157	The incubation period ranges from 1 week to 1 month	1
21158	The symptoms of @DISEASE$ infection may include @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ with a case fatality rate of 10 % [ 54 ]	1
21159	Approximately half of the survivors experience permanent @DISEASE$ , such as recurrent @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( https : / / www	1
21160	CDC	1
21161	gov )	1
21162	There are no antiviral treatments or vaccines available against @DISEASE$ .	1
21163	Selection is evident in @GENE$ and other @GENE$	1
21164	In certain sites of the @GENE$ of @GENE$ , non - synonymous substitutions occur at more than twice the rate as in other sites [ 39 ]	1
21165	This is seen as a major signature of adaptive change , but deleterious mutations in the areas not under selection are carried along with the ones under positive selection [ 36 ]	1
21166	In this light , some perceive H1N1 to be a growing threat , with a new outbreak being just a matter of time	1
21167	Despite this common perception , a more lethal version of @GENE$ has not arisen via mutation within the human population during the last 90 + years	1
21168	This is significant	1
21169	The two major human @DISEASE$ pandemics since 1918 did not arise due to mutations within @GENE$ , but arose via horizontal transmission of new genetic material from bird influenza strains , creating recombinant viruses	1
21170	They were also less lethal than the 1918 version	1
21171	It is true that the population had a degree of residual immunity and was not as immunologically naïve as it was in 1917 - 18 , but selection has still not been able to generate a devastating pandemic from the remnants of that which swept the world at the close of WWI .	1
21172	The approximately @GENE$ is coded on the second @GENE$ and overlaps completely the @GENE$ coding region [ 58 , 59 ] Table 1	1
21173	@GENE$ has been implicated in increasing host death rate	1
21174	Yet , not all influenza viruses code for this protein , so it is not intrinsically necessary for the cycle of infection	1
21175	In the case of H1N1 , the majority ( 98	1
21176	2 % ) of genomes in this study are predicted to fail to produce a full - length version of the protein , including most of the human versions after 1948 and none of the porcine versions prior to 1987	1
21177	For this reason , only 10 of the 11 @GENE$ were included in RSCU and NCS calculations	1
21178	All genomes were predicted to produce fully - formed @GENE$ , PB1 , PA , HA , @GENE$	1
21179	Only 14 genomes were expected to fail to produce a functioning @GENE$ due to mutation in the @GENE$ , but all of these had another potential in - frame ATG only a few @GENE$ / or downstream	1
21180	For this reason , we assumed these viruses would also produce an @GENE$ of proper length .	1

21185	, 2012 ) and one homolog each of @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( Table 1 )	1

21188	Partial RNAi knock - down of @GENE$ in the fly nervous system did not reveal any obvious neuronal phenotypes ( Tsou et al	1
21189	, 2012 )	1
21190	It will be informative to investigate the null phenotype of the @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the fly nervous system .	1
21191	The @GENE$ servers project is documented and can be downloaded from the servers ' web site , http : / / servers	1

21193	org .	1
21194	More concerning it is that one of the K	1
21195	pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to all available antibiotics including all the first line and second line antibiotics ( Table 2 )	1
21196	Antibiotic resistance patterns for the next predominating @DISEASE$ agent Streptococcus species ( n = 10 ) were also alarming because there was 30 % to 80 % resistance frequency for all antibiotics except ceftriaxone	1
21197	For E	1
21198	agglomerans , 3 out of 4 isolates showed resistance to antibiotics like azithromycin , ceftriaxone , cefixime , tobramycin , and ciprofloxacin , whereas 2 isolates showed resistance to gentamicin	1
21199	Even the carbapenems - imipenem and meropenem appeared ineffective against one E	1
21200	agglomerans isolate , which showed resistance to all antibiotics	1
21201	Finally , at least 1 of 3 isolates of H	1
21202	influenzae showed some degrees of resistance to the antibiotics tested for antibiogram study .	1
21203	Thus , the data suggest that all of the bacterial isolates except E	1
21204	agglomerans had a peak circulation in September , which is also the peak season for the most predominant viral agent @DISEASE$ and this phenomenon of simultaneous occurrences of viral and bacterial pathogens may facilitate huge numbers of bacterial coinfections with @DISEASE$ .	1
21205	Stimulation with a class A CpG oligonucleotide enhances resistance to infection with feline viruses from five different families	1
21206	Despite a high prevalence of 186 confirmed @DISEASE$ cases during the outbreak of @DISEASE$ in Korea , the rate of asymptomatic infection ( 1	1
21207	60 % ) [ 15 ] was lower than expected	1
21208	The rates of asymptomatic infection confirmed using IFA and PRNT in the present study were 0	1
21209	06 % ( 1 of 1 , 610 ) for all contacts and 0	1
21210	17 % ( 1 of 574 ) for patients	1
21211	These results are markedly lower than the rates of 0	1
21212	27 % ( 2 of 737 ) among healthcare workers , and 0	1
21213	44 % ( 2 of 457 ) among healthcare workers at @DISEASE$ - affected hospitals in Korea [ 16 ]	1
21214	Moreover , the rate of asymptomatic or mild infection in Sau - di Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , and the Islamic Republic of Iran was approximately 28	1
21215	00 % [ 12 , 13 , 18 ] .	1
21216	Miyazaki	1
21217	@GENE$ , a ubiquitously expressed @GENE$ , has been demonstrated to interact with the soluble truncated form of HCV @GENE$ [ 89 ]	1
21218	Its large @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) seems to play a critical role in this interaction process	1
21219	Moreover , studies have identified several amino acid residues throughout the @GENE$ and HCV E2 , which might be crucial for E2 @GENE$ binding [ 90 , 91 ]	1
21220	@GENE$ , an @GENE$ with a large @GENE$ , is highly expressed in the liver [ 92 ] .	1
21221	In addition to @GENE$ , HCV internalization and fusion are complex processes that also offer several targets for antivirals	1
21222	A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ( PS - ON ) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [ 117 ]	1
21223	The human liver - chimeric Alb - uPA / SCID mouse model also showed that PS - ON block de novo @DISEASE$ infection	1
21224	These data shed light on the promise of PS - ON as future clinical solution .	1
21225	Although numerous pathogens are associated with @DISEASE$ , the clinical manifestations of @DISEASE$ are almost similar in all cases , irrespective of causative agents	1
21226	So , detection of the potential causative agents is the prerequisite for proper treatment and viral detection can reduce the irrational and overuse of antibiotics	1
21227	@DISEASE$ due to @DISEASE$ have become a global concern especially because of the emergence of an increasing number of multi - drug resistant bacteria	1
21228	Although some studies have examined the viral etiology of @DISEASE$ in the under - five children in Bangladesh , information is lacking on bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance / sensitivity pattern [ 10 , 11 ]	1
21229	Lack of information regarding etiological agents influences the use of inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotics which in turn fosters antimicrobial resistance	1
21230	The purpose of this study was to examine both viral and bacterial pathogens of @DISEASE$ among under - five children of Bangladesh in hospital settings over a period of 1 year	1
21231	The viral pathogens were identified using RT - qPCR targeting 10 common respiratory viruses and microbiological culture method was used to examine pathogenic bacterial spectrum and determine their antibiotic susceptibility pattern .	1
21232	The physician suspected the patient of having atypical pathogens when they had persistent or deteriorating symptoms or signs despite treatment with appropriate empirical antibiotics for 2 - 3 days	1
21233	Thus , we compared the clinicolaboratory findings between Adv and Non - Adv group patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment ( Table 4 )	1
21234	The number of patients who did not a response to initial antibiotics treatment was 47 and 50 in the Adv and Non - Adv groups , respectively	1
21235	The percentage of patients having @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ was higher in the Adv patients , although there was no significant difference in white blood cell and platelet counts between the two groups	1
21236	@DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , which were a showed a significant difference in all study patients , showed no difference in patients with unresponsiveness to initial antibiotics treatment ( P = 0	1
21237	720 , P = 0	1
21238	733 , respectively )	1
21239	A greater number of Adv group patients exhibited no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non - Adv group patients ( 25	1
21240	5 % vs	1
21241	10	1
21242	0 % , P = 0	1
21243	045 ) as well as the number of patients to reach over 40 ° C and 39 to 40 ° C ( P = 0	1
21244	003 )	1
21245	In addition , the Adv group patients had a higher mean temperature at admission than the Non - Adv group patients ( 37	1
21246	8 ± 0	1
21247	3 vs	1
21248	37	1

21251	005 )	1
21252	Table 5 compares the clinicolaboratory variables between the combined Adv ( cAdv ) , Non - Adv , and only Adv identified pathogen ( OAIP ) group patients	1
21253	Compared to the cAdv and Non - Adv patients , more patients in the @DISEASE$ group exhibited the following characteristics : were currently smoking ; had @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ; exhibited a longer duration of @DISEASE$ after symptom onset ; had a higher maximal temperature at admission ( over 40 ° C and 39 - 40 ° C ) ; and exhibited no response to antipyretics at admission .	1
21254	@DISEASE$ was mainly attributable to S	1
21255	pneumoniae , human metapneumovirus , @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ among children in Mali	1
21256	Increased pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage in children would significantly reduce the burden of @DISEASE$ in this country	1
21257	The addition of a control group to assess etiologies of @DISEASE$ in children is critical to properly interpret the microbiological results of diagnostic testing with high sensitivity .	1
21258	Among the 47 patients who took antibiotics before hospitalization , 17 ( 14	1
21259	4 % ) received Amoxicillin , 8 ( 5	1
21260	6 % ) Ceftriaxone , 4 ( 2	1
21261	8 % ) Amoxicillin / Clavulanic acid , and 3 ( 2	1
21262	1 % ) Cotrimoxazole	1
21263	Among the 63 cases tested for antibiotic detection testing in urine , 22 ( 65	1
21264	1 % ) were positive ; in this population , sensitivity of declared antibiotic use compared with urine detection was low ( sensitivity = 51	1

21268	CoV @GENE$ is a serious virulence factor , which facilitates the biological actions of MERS - CoV	1
21269	Studying the @GENE$ can advance our understanding of pathogenicity of MERS - CoV and facilitate development of better therapeutics	1
21270	Host gene expression in infected cells is suppressed by MERS - CoV @GENE$ , which also promotes virus assembly or budding in in vitro , leading to efficient virus replication , suggesting @GENE$ is also critical for MERS - CoV replication and promotes production of virus particles in the host [ 42 ]	1
21271	The severity of @DISEASE$ is relatively more in patients with co - morbid conditions , such as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and others with compromised immune systems [ 9 ] .	1
21272	Locally , the coverage of the 7 - valent or 10 - valent and 13valent vaccines was 65 % and 90 % , respectively [ 2 ]	1
21273	The parents reported that the child received one prior dose of 7 - valent vaccine before 3 years of age in early 2010	1
21274	It is possible that @GENE$ was a commonly circulating strain before the introduction of the 10 - valent or 13 - valent vaccines	1
21275	The 13 - valent vaccine should stop circulation of @GENE$ when the program is fully implemented .	1
21276	The core set includes samples isolated over a time frame from 1959 to 2006 and represents globally distributed localities from Thailand to Bavaria , Germany	1
21277	All the phylograms have essentially yielded geographic based clustering rather than time based clustering	1
21278	The seven distinct clades that were clearly demarcated are : Thailand clade I ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) , @GENE$ clade II ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) , Thailand clade III ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) , Indian clade ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) Scotland clade ( @GENE$ ; @GENE$ ) Bavarian clade ( @GENE$ ; Workflow Scalability for large data sets A quick perusal of the results obtained with the three algorithms ( ProtPars , NJ and UPGMA ) has confirmed the pattern obtained from the core set	1
21279	The strains of H5N1 _ NA cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to host	1
21280	However , there are subtle differences amongst the outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution	1
21281	The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub - speciation	1
21282	A detailed analysis of the Thai clade obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well	1
21283	The additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to Uniprot	1
21284	An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry @GENE$ ( Chicken isolate from Vietnam ) is placed almost as an outlier in this group	1
21285	It would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any " bridging " isolates such as @GENE$ that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe	1
21286	We have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set	1
21287	A detailed analysis of each geographic clade with respect to the " bridging " isolates such as @GENE$ may reveal a global pattern of @GENE$ spread .	1
21288	To reconstruct the dynamics of @GENE$ and 15 gain and loss , publically available vertebrate genome assemblies and gene prediction datasets were queried for @GENE$ using a combination of blast searches [ 65 ] , pairwise comparisons of genomic sequences using dotter [ 66 ] and the sim4cc program [ 67 ] that aligns reference @GENE$ to genomic sequences from other species	1
21289	We eliminated from further analysis any @GENE$ that contained frameshifts or nonsense mutations , but retained some genes that were missing up to three @GENE$ within genome assembly gaps	1
21290	Protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [ 68 ] with manual adjustment and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees ( 1000 bootstrap replicates ) were constructed using PhyML [ 69 ] using the best - fitting evolutionary model ( JTT + I + G + F ) as determined by Prottest [ 70 ]	1
21291	Trees were displayed using MEGA [ 71 ] .	1
21292	Post - translational protein modifications are a common regulatory mechanism for modulating protein activity , stability and localization	1
21293	As such , numerous viruses manipulate host @GENE$ machinery to regulate their own replication or evade host antiviral immunity	1
21294	Research aimed at understanding these viral strategies has provided critical insight into the host processes mediated by @GENE$ , including tyrosine phosphorylation and regulation of histone acetylation [ 1 , 2 ]	1
21295	Inspired by the fact that signatures of positive selection can be used to highlight important genes and @GENE$ in host - virus conflicts , we performed an evolutionary screen on all of the @GENE$ to ask if ADP - ribosylation is an important player in host - virus dynamics	1
21296	Contrary to what would be expected of a @GENE$ that is solely dedicated to housekeeping functions , we found strong evidence for rapid evolution in five of seventeen @GENE$ , suggesting a broad involvement for @GENE$ , and ADP - ribosylation , in genetic conflicts	1
21297	Moreover , we observed evolutionary signatures that suggested an ancient history of conflict for these @GENE$	1
21298	For example , we see positive selection on @GENE$ in diverse mammalian clades and recurrent gain and loss of @GENE$ and @GENE$ across vertebrates	1
21299	Our findings suggest that @GENE$ are each locked in a genetic conflict , likely with one or more pathogenic agents .	1
21300	Five patients in the control group suffered @DISEASE$ of extrapulmonary origin ( three patients with @DISEASE$ and two with @DISEASE$ )	1
21301	The initial PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio in the IVIG group was significantly lower than that in the control group ( IVIG , median 67 vs control , 93 ; t test , log - transformed data , p = 0	1
21302	009 )	1
21303	Seventy - five percent of the IVIG - treated patients had severe @DISEASE$ , 25 % had moderate @DISEASE$ , and no patient showed mild @DISEASE$	1
21304	In the control group , 55 % of patients had severe @DISEASE$ , 35 % had moderate @DISEASE$ , and 10 % had mild @DISEASE$	1
21305	The ECMO duration was shorter in the control group ( 1 - 45 days ; median 14 days ) compared to that in the IVIG group ( 4 - 78 days ; median 18 days ) and could be reduced earlier in the control group ( median 10 days ) than in the IVIG group ( median 16 days )	1
21306	The duration of ventilator support was longer in the IVIG group ( 91 - 2005 h ; median 571 h ) compared to that in the control group ( 20 - 1323 h ; median 399 h ; t test , logtransformed data , p = 0	1
21307	055 )	1
21308	Five patients in the control group and three patients in the IVIG group were extubated before ECMO was discontinued	1
21309	Ten patients in the control group and seven patients in the IVIG group suffered @DISEASE$ due to bleeding complications , including @DISEASE$ ( control : n = 3 ; IVIG : n = 2 ) ( Table 1 ) .	1
21310	We have developed a freely available , automated method of @GENE$ analysis from digital video ( AVI ) files that runs using open - source software ( ImageJ ) coupled to Microsoft Excel	1
21311	The @GENE$ software allowed automated , high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency over a wide range of frequencies ( range 3 to 52 Hz ) and avoids operator error due to selection bias .	1

21337	The Syrian golden hamster develops an @DISEASE$ when infected with ANDV or MAPV [ 22 , 23 ]	1
21338	Hamsters inoculated with ANDV mount an inflammatory response , as measured by elevated mRNA encod@GENE$ ro - infl@GENE$  succumbing to the disease [ 55 ]	1
21339	Infection also results in the activation of the adaptive immune response , characterized by antigen - specific proliferation of T cells and the generation of virus - sp@GENE$ ]	1
21340	In contrast , SNV , which is highly pathogenic in humans , replicates in hamsters , but does not cause disease and is cleared by the immune response [ 87 ]	1
21341	Passaging of SNV in hamsters results in a virus that is able to replicate efficiently and cause a persistent infection similar to what is seen in the rodent reservoir , yet still does not cause disease [ 88 ]	1
21342	Examination of immune responses elicited by ANDV ( pathogenic in hamsters ) and SNV ( non - pathogenic in hamsters ) showed that passaged SNV evoked a stronger adaptive immune response than did ANDV ; however , ANDV infection induced a much stronger innate immune response at late time points , despite both viruses replicating to similar levels	1
21343	Depletion of T cells did not alter the outcome of infection [ 74 , 86 ] ; thus , these data suggest that , at least in the hamster model , the activation of the T cell - mediated immune response is not responsible for immunopathogenesis , and perhaps the innate immune response , either elicited from infected endothelial cells , macrophages and / or neutrophils , might contribute to disease .	1
21344	Ultra - thin cryosections and immunogold labeling HEK293T cells transfected as described above were fixed for one hour with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer ( pH 7	1

21347	Ninety nm ultra - thin cryosections were made at − 110 ° C on a LEICA UCT cryoultramicrotome	1
21348	Sections were retrieved with a methylcellulose 2 % / sucrose 2	1
21349	3 M mixture ( 1 : 1 ) and collected onto formvar / carbon coated nickel grids	1
21350	Sections were incubated with @GENE$ and @GENE$ ( F7425 , Sigma and @GENE$ , @GENE$ )	1
21351	After extensive washing , grids were incubated with @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ ( 10 and 5 nm , Sigma )	1
21352	Grids were washed , post - fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde and rinsed	1
21353	Contrasting step was performed by incubating grids on drops of uranyl acetate 4 % / methycellulose 2 % mixture ( 1 : 10 )	1
21354	The sections were imaged on a transmission electron microscope at 100 kV ( JEOL 1011 , Tokyo , Japan ) .	1

21358	We conducted a telephone survey of the general population in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario , Canada	1

21361	The mosquito - borne @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) causes severe @DISEASE$ and cycles between Culex mosquitoes and different vertebrates	1
21362	For @DISEASE$ and some other flaviviruses , oronasal transmission is described , but the mode of infection is unknown	1
21363	Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells ( NEC ) at the air - liquid interface ( ALI ) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for @DISEASE$ in pigs	1
21364	Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with @DISEASE$ resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruit@GENE$ ection and replication in macrophages	1
21365	Moreover , macrophages stimulated by alarmins , inclu@GENE$ rleukin - 25@GENE$ 33@GENE$ omal l@GENE$ issive to the @DISEASE$ infection	1
21366	Altogether , our data are important to understand the mechanism of nonvector - borne direct transmission of @DISEASE$ in pigs	1
21367	IMPORTANCE @DISEASE$ , a main cause of severe @DISEASE$ in humans , has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito - waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs , which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes , leading to increased human cases	1
21368	@DISEASE$ can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors	1
21369	Moreover , virus or viral RNA is found in oro@GENE$ etions and the nasal epithelium	1
21370	Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three - dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus	1
21371	Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemo@GENE$ nd replication in macrophages , which is favored by epithelial - cell - deriv@GENE$ t to understand the mechanism of non - vector - borne direct transmission of JEV .	1
21372	@DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ and it is usually spread through the air by droplet nuclei	1
21373	Transmission generally occurs indoors , in dark and poorly ventilated spaces	1
21374	The following sub - themes will be discussed under fear , anxiety , stress , and risk of contracting infection : Exposure to risk , fear to contact patients , and patients spreading disease .	1
21375	A personalized written action plan , meaning a document explaining how to deal with the condition , particularly in the event of an attack , and when to refer to the doctor or the emergency services , is widely accepted as good practice in @DISEASE$ education and self - management [ 30 ]	1
21376	According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence , providing patients with such a plan is a quality indicator and can improve outcomes such as self - efficacy , knowledge , and confidence for people with @DISEASE$	1
21377	In those who have had a recent exacerbation , resulting in admission to hospital , it may reduce readmission rates [ 31 ]	1
21378	Quite recently , a survey was conducted among 277 pediatricians in 6 European countries to assess the care for @DISEASE$ children in the outpatients ' setting in terms of therapeutic education ; it turned out that 80 % of the sampled patients received a personalized action plan during the visit ( 83 % in Italy ) [ 32 ]	1
21379	Several papers consider the availability of an individualized action plan among the interventions that can help reducing ED visits for @DISEASE$ [ 2 , 20 , 21 ]	1
21380	Some authors also suggest the use of electronic action plans that might be delivered to the patients at ED discharge [ 33 ] .	1
21381	Understanding the proportion of children with a preexisting diagnosis of @DISEASE$ seeking advice in the ED for an exacerbation is important both for the individual patients and for the community , in terms of disease control and quality of life , and of healthcare costs , respectively	1
21382	A history of @DISEASE$ in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 @DISEASE$ patients aged 6 - 20 years [ 19 ]	1
21383	@DISEASE$ exacerbations are largely preventable [ 2 ] , and so are ED visits and hospitalizations for this reason [ 9 , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]	1
21384	In the United States , there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden , such as school - based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines , but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that , despite these measures , the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for @DISEASE$ did not change significantly over time [ 9 ] .	1
21385	In vitro and in vivo therapeutic studies	1
21386	The clonogenic survival assays were conducted as previously described 41	1
21387	Mouse care and treatment was approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee	1
21388	Cells maintained under standard conditions were detached by treatment with 0	1
21389	25 % @GENE$ - EDTA solution and washed in Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS )	1
21390	They were then suspended in a 60 % mixture of Matrigel Matrix ( BD Biosciences ) in HBSS at a concentration of 1	1
21391	0 × 10 6 cells per 100 μL of solution	1
21392	The cells were then injected into the subcutis overlying the rear flanks of 6 - week - old male nude mice ( Harlan )	1
21393	Once the @DISEASE$ were established , the animals were randomized into three treatment groups per xenograft	1
21394	The both cyc - LHSPW and cyc - NGR were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile PBS to a final DMSO concentration of 5 % v / v	1
21395	The mice were then dosed via tail vein injection with 40 mg / kg of the cyclic peptides or saline at days three times a week for four weeks total	1
21396	Tumor measurements were made twice weekly with calipers and the @DISEASE$ volume ( in mm 3 ) was calculated by the formula 0	1
21397	5236 × length ( L ) × width ( W ) × height ( H )	1
21398	The endpoint of the study was either five weeks after the first treatment dose or when the @DISEASE$ reached a volume of 1 , 000 mm 3 as dictated by our animal protocol	1
21399	@DISEASE$ were removed from euthanized animals , formalin fixed and stained for Ki67 using the manufacturer ' s protocol .	1
21400	Based on the simulation results , the number of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of each passenger can be obtained according to the locations of the suspended aerosols and the breathing zone	1
21401	Then the volume density of expiratory droplets v ( x , t ) can be calculated and the intake fraction can also be obtained by using Eq	1

21403	Figure 5 shows the exposure levels of eighteen selected passengers from line 1 ~ 12 and seat A ~ F for case 1 ~ 3 , including seven passengers infected with @DISEASE$ after the flight ( passenger 2C , 5E , 7D , 8E , 9B , 11B and 12B ) and eleven healthy passengers ( passenger 1D , 3E , 4C , 6D , 7 F , 8A , 9A , 10B , 10D , 11 F and 12C )	1
21404	The exposure level is demonstrated by the relative intake dose , which is the intake fraction of the passenger in each time step	1
21405	The seating plan of the passengers can be found in Figure 1	1
21406	Figure 5 shows that the relative intake dose of each passenger is significantly different for different moving speeds	1
21407	Even the passengers seated 8 rows ahead or 3 rows behind the index patient are affected by the movement	1
21408	Hence the volume density distribution of expiratory droplets in the airplane cabin and the relative intake dose of each passenger can be significantly influenced by human movement	1
21409	Figure 6 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 13 , respectively	1
21410	Passengers who are seated close to the index patient ( especially for row 7 - 10 , seat D - F ) have much higher intake fractions than other passengers	1
21411	The intake fractions of the passengers seated on the right side of the moving person ( seat D - F ) are slightly higher than that on the left side ( seat A - C )	1
21412	Lower intake fractions can be found from the passengers seated far away from the index patient ( row 1 - 4 )	1
21413	Comparing Figure 6 ( a ) ~ ( c ) , differences can be found in the intake fraction of every passenger	1
21414	After human movement , more than half of the passengers will have higher intake fractions ( 41 passengers for case 2 and 38 for case 3 )	1
21415	Compared with case 1 , the variation range of the intake fractions is − 91 % ~ + 472 % for case 2 and − 99 % ~ + 255 % for case 3	1
21416	The average intake fraction of all the 71 seated passenger ( with the index patient and the moving person excluded ) is 1	1

21423	For each protein tested , 40 l of a 50 % suspension of glutathione - agarose beads was centrifuged ( 500 g , 5 min ) , the supernatant removed and the beads washed sequentially with 200 l water and thrice with @GENE$ wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7	1
21424	6 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT )	1
21425	Following incubation with @GENE$ ( 6 g ) for 1 h at 4 • C on a rotating wheel , the protein was removed and the beads washed three times with @GENE$ wash buffer	1
21426	@GENE$ ( 2 g ) was added to the beads and the incubation and washing steps repeated , with the @GENE$ wash buffer supplemented with 0	1
21427	1 % @GENE$	1
21428	After removal of the final wash , 25 l 4 × Laemmli ' s sample buffer was added , the beads boiled for 5 min and supernatants analysed by SDS - PAGE .	1
21429	In light of the laying performance , virological and pathological data , we believe that the experimental setting successfully reproduced the clinical disease , and the associated acute and chronic drops in egg production observed during G1 - lineage H9N2 outbreaks in the field [ 4 , 23 ]	1
21430	Since we ruled out other microbiological agents as causes of @DISEASE$ , the clinical picture associated with the replication of this virus in healthy chicken layers , allow us to think of it as an atypical pathotype of @DISEASE$ virus , capable of causing permanent economic losses , regardless of concomitant diseases in the flock	1
21431	Under this perspective , we think this virus should be considered a primary pathogen of the oviduct , similarly to IBV , NDV and @DISEASE$ viruses [ 43 , 53 ] .	1
21432	Among the poor populations , women who were either pregnant or considering pregnancy were also more vulnerable to the effects of @DISEASE$ , as the virus is considered to be a teratogen ( Mazzu - Nascimento et al	1
21433	2017 )	1
21434	Government programs in Brazil that intend to provide free mosquito repellent to pregnant women do not consistently reach some of the poorest communities , such communities are remote and often lack accessible quality health care facilities due to distance and poor physical infrastructure ( Hennigan 2016 )	1
21435	Access to quality reproductive health care is essential given the accumulating evidence linking the @DISEASE$ to a rise in cases of infants born with @DISEASE$ - an unusually small head for age and sex ( World Health Organization 2017a )	1
21436	Conditions related to poverty , such as poor sanitation and increased exposure to larvicides and insecticides , which may cause mutation , have also been implicated ( Diniz 2016 ) .	1
21437	In the case of the @DISEASE$ epidemic , most of the literature on the attribution of infectious disease responsibility focused primarily on the cause , rather than the response , with most of the literature suggesting that globalization was responsible for the spread of @DISEASE$ .	1
21438	PPMOs appear to be generally well tolerated by cultured cells and animal recipients	1
21439	However , some studies reported toxicity in cell culture with increase of PPMO dose [ 66 ] or longer period of exposure [ 66 , 75 ] , and in vivo toxicity as the treatment dose increased , usually at doses higher than antiviral ones [ 67 ]	1
21440	The peptide moiety of PPMOs seems to contribute to this toxicity	1
21441	When Deas et al	1
21442	tested both PMO and PPMO against @DISEASE$ in mice , they found that mice could tolerate higher doses of PMO compared to PPMO ( 3 mg against 300 μg , respectively ) [ 67 ]	1
21443	Mice treated with high doses of PPMO would suffer from @DISEASE$ and develop @DISEASE$ and smaller livers	1
21444	Besides dosedependent toxicity , the schedule of treatment regimen may also affect @DISEASE$ toxicity : while Burrer et al	1
21445	did not document any treatment - associated toxicity when PPMOs were administered to healthy mice , they observed significant toxicity when PPMO treatment was given after @DISEASE$ challenge [ 63 ]	1
21446	Lupfer et a l	1
21447	reported abnormal infiltration of mouse lungs by immune system cells when PPMO tar@GENE$  FLUAV was administered at higher doses [ 83 ]	1
21448	The authors hypothesized th@GENE$ ch CPP mimi@GENE$ rotein , also rich in arginine residues , in triggering the migration of inflammatory cells .	1

21451	In order to demonstrate that flavonoid - based natural compounds extracted from P	1
21452	tomentosa act as inhibitors of @GENE$ , a comparative activity screen was performed	1
21453	This method relies on substrate hydrolysis , leading to an increase in fluorescence that can be read out in real time	1
21454	Interestingly , a geranyl ( 3 , 7 - dimethylocta - 2 , 6 - dienyl ) group at the C6 position within the flavonoid was found to be crucial for both inhibi - tory potency and kinetic mechanism	1
21455	For example , diplacone showed a 150 - fold higher efficacy ( IC 50 = 0	1
21456	11 mM ) than eriodictyol , a parent flavonoid lacking a geranyl group ( IC 50 = 16	1
21457	4 mM ) ( Table 2 )	1
21458	As shown in Fig	1
21459	1 , diplacone showed competitive kinetics , with a K i value of 0	1
21460	04 mM	1
21461	Diplacone also acted as a time - dependent inhibitor .	1
21462	To summarize , existing methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings : 1 ) slow running time , or 2 ) poor prediction accuracy	1
21463	Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information , or constraints , that can guide prediction	1
21464	In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user - defined constraints , it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method ' s accuracy persists as the input information degrades	1
21465	We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method	1
21466	( We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise	1
21467	) To the best of our knowledge , the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before .	1
21468	The used in vitro NEC model has the advantage of representing fully differentiated @DISEASE$ cultures containing mucus - producing goblet cells and functional cilia , which both represent first physical barriers of infection	1
21469	In contrast to in vivo work , such cultures permit controlled kinetics studies of virus infection and basolateral and apical shedding , which is not possible in vivo	1
21470	The same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding and analyzing the impa@GENE$ ctors	1
21471	Such models may be used for any species and therefore permit analysis of species differences .	1
21472	Although vector - borne transmission is generally assumed for Bartonella in other hosts [ 12 , 19 , 25 , 77 ] , including some Neotropical bats [ 16 , 78 ] , infection status in vampire bats was not associated with bat fly intensity	1
21473	Further supporting this observation , male bats had higher odds of @DISEASE$ but did not differ in their bat fly intensities compared to females	1
21474	Weak correspondence between bat fly intensity at the time of sampling and @DISEASE$ infection thus may cast doubt on bat flies as a primary transmission route	1
21475	Time lags could provide one reason for this discrepancy , given that new @DISEASE$ may take days or weeks to develop and become detectable and over which time ectoparasite load may have changed due to the mobile nature of bat flies [ 26 , 36 , 79 ]	1
21476	On the other hand , it is possible that vector presence ( rather than abundance ) is a more important driver of transmission	1
21477	Unfortunately , nearly all bats in this study had ectoparasites , so comparisons of Bartonella presence in bats with and without bat flies had little statistical power ( 31 / 36 Bartonella - positive bats were infested with at least one bat fly )	1
21478	Given that @DISEASE$ predicted @DISEASE$ more generally across a Mexian bat community [ 16 ] , larger sample sizes with greater variation in bat fly intensity could provide better inference	1
21479	However , our phylogenetic analysis does provide a tentative line of evidence supporting vector - borne transmission , as several of Bartonella genotypes fell within the same clade as Bartonella from streblid bat flies [ 29 ]	1
21480	A recent survey of Mexican bats and their sympatric bat flies suggested that corresponding hosts and their bat flies had varied Bartonella genotypes , although one vampire bat did show complete sequence homology with the Bartonella from its paired bat flies [ 37 ]	1
21481	As genetic similarity between Bartonella in bat flies and hosts has been interpreted as evidence of vector - borne transmission in other bat species [ 29 , 54 ] , further assessments of Bartonella genotypes between vampire bats and their various ectoparasites ( bat flies but also ticks ) would shed additional light on possible routes of vector - borne transmission .	1
21482	In contrast , nested PCR of individual swabs detected @GENE$ in 21	1
21483	4 % of saliva samples ( 6 / 28 ) and 30 % of fecal samples ( 9 / 30 )	1
21484	For swab samples that were also assessed by PCR in blood ( n = 15 for saliva , n = 28 for feces ) , both corresponding positive saliva samples were positive in blood ; most positive fecal samples were also PCR positive in blood , although one fecal - positive sample was PCR negative in blood ( S4 Fig )	1
21485	For our random subset of sequenced positive saliva ( n = 4 ) and fecal ( n = 5 ) samples , phylogenetic analyses suggested that all sequences shared a minimum of 97 % identity to one or more of our 35 @GENE$ ( @GENE$ Table , Fig 6 )	1
21486	In many cases , saliva and fecal sequences were the same genotype as @GENE$ sequences derived from the same geographic region ( e	1

21488	, the @GENE$ from D234 shared > 96 % identity to the @GENE$ from D98 , both from @GENE$ )	1

21530	The re - emergence of @DISEASE$ in two Australian states in relatively quick succession over a three - year period , caused by two distinct @DISEASE$ lineages , raises the question as to why this disease is re - emerging now , after decades of apparent quiescence	1
21531	Animal shelters are conducive environments for pathogen emergence or re - emergence because of a large number of susceptible hosts living in a confined area	1
21532	This is exacerbated by factors including young age , immunological naivety or immunosuppression , close contact and co - morbidities such as heavy parasite burdens	1
21533	Similarly , suboptimal biosecurity protocols favour pathogen persistence and fomite transmission [ 34 ] .	1
21534	The duration of faecal shedding of FPV , which is relevant to infection control , has been inadequately studied	1
21535	This study demonstrates that virus can be shed in faeces for an extended period of up to 14 weeks from diagnosis	1

21537	Shedding of field @DISEASE$ strains in dogs has been detected by qPCR for 45 - 50 days [ 44 , 45 ] , while @DISEASE$ vaccine virus was shed for 19 - 22 days on average [ 31 , 46 ]	1
21538	Further studies are warranted in cats to further define the duration of faecal shedding of both field and vaccine strains of FPV detectable by qPCR .	1
21539	When molecular sequence data started to be accumulated nearly 20 years ago , it was noted that synonymous codons are not used equally in different genomes , even in different genes of the same genome [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]	1
21540	As an important evolutionary phenomenon , it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [ 4 , 5 ]	1
21541	Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryote and eukaryote , such as Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]	1
21542	These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome , and among genomes	1
21543	The codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure [ 9 , 10 ]	1
21544	Recent studies of viral codon usage has shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection in determining codon usage bias of some viruses , such as Picornaviridae , @DISEASE$ , plant viruses , and vertebrate DNA viruses [ 9 , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
21545	Meanwhile , recent report also showed that the G + C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in @@GENE$ 11 , 14 ]	1
21546	Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution or individual genes of the viruses .	1

21549	Are the methods appropriate and well described , and are sufficient details provided to allow others to evaluate and / or replicate the work ?	1
21550	Might the observed divergence be primarily due to adaptive mutations ? We feel that the 15 % divergence must be primarily non - adaptive because adaptation should occur rapidly and then reach a natural optimum	1
21551	Yet , we see that divergence increases in a remarkably linear manner	1
21552	Furthermore , the virus does not seem to be converging on a new optimal genotype since polymorphism remains extreme ( over 50 % ) , since many polymorphic sites have more than two @GENE$ , and since codon specificity is declining over time	1
21553	Codon patterns can inform us about the origin of the virus , and they tell us that H1N1 is not only drifting away from that original codon use , but it is also drifting away from the host codon preferences	1
21554	When grown in mouse cell culture , 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited variation in replication rates , virulence , and pathogenicity , but these did not match the severity of clinical symptoms in humans [ 66 ]	1
21555	Thus , at this time , the exact relationship between mutation load and the severity of infection remains unknown	1
21556	Yet , selective adaptation is limited to only those amino acids that produce significant phenotypic effects [ 42 ] , and , since a @GENE$ in the absence of reassortment is essentially a @GENE$ , it is expected that many more than just adaptive mutations occur	1
21557	Some of the changes might be due to selection , but the majority certainly are not .	1

21573	Triage acuity is defined by a 4 - grade colour scale , white being the less urgent and red being the most	1
21574	A white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs ; it can be reevaluated by the triage nurse if the symptoms modify and it might gain a higher priority	1
21575	A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant , acute - onset symptoms ; they should be reevaluated by the triage nurse every 30 - 60 minutes until medical evaluation	1
21576	A yellow code is for those with severe lesions and altered vital signs that require rapid medical evaluation , so that these cases are closely communicated to the attending physician	1
21577	A red code means that the condition is life - threatening ( vital functions are compromised ) and the patient requires immediate evaluation .	1
21578	A database query is specified by naming the entities and relationships along a path through the @GENE$ diagram ( Fig	1

21580	g	1
21581	, a particular genome or identifier )	1
21582	The Sapling Server allows direct queries against the database ; however , a set of common data requests is implemented as direct server functions	1
21583	Sapling Server functions typically accept multiple input values within a single call , allowing a client to minimize the number of requests that must be made to the server	1
21584	Additional input parameters allow a client to modify the query , for example , to request that the output be in @GENE$ format or to ask for protein rather than @GENE$ .	1
21585	This program reads a FASTA file of protein sequences and attempts to assign function to those sequences using a K - merbased algorithm	1
21586	When a function is proposed , the program will produce a ' ' score ' ' ( the number of distinct @GENE$ that were matched ) and an estimate of phylogenetic neighborhood - a representative genome that is ' ' phylogenetically close ' ' to the genome containing the protein , if an estimate can reasonably be given .	1
21587	The study identified 35 cases with @DISEASE$ where RSV and S	1

21592	pneumoniae showed a seasonal peak in September and both S	1

21594	pneumoniae had significant participation in mixed infections demonstrating that viral infection renders bacterial colonization	1
21595	Higher rates of @DISEASE$ by S	1
21596	pneumoniae and K	1
21597	pneumoniae in synergy with RSV , HRV , and other viruses may indicate that predominant @DISEASE$ viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria	1
21598	The other major viral partners of @DISEASE$ included HMPV and HPIV	1
21599	The mechanisms by which viruses influence bacterial colonization and invasion are very diverse	1
21600	It has been shown that viral infections may predispose to @DISEASE$ super - infections by favoring bacterial attachment sites on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and through increased mucous production that promotes bacterial growth [ 55 , 56 ]	1
21601	The real clinical significance of these infections has not yet been fully elucidated	1
21602	Under the circumstances , emphasis should be given on deciphering the role of bacterial mixed infections in promoting disease pathology	1
21603	The presence of pathogens in asymptomatic children made the aspect more puzzling	1
21604	However , a case control study hypothesized that there could have a subclinical infection in asymptomatic cases which may act as a pathogen transmission source [ 57 ]	1
21605	It is also important to remember that the detection rate of mixed infection is dependent mostly on methodology and number of pathogens that are being screened	1
21606	Despite differences in methodologies , the similarity in rates of hospitalized @DISEASE$ in different countries suggests that respiratory viruses indeed are important contributors of childhood hospitalization around the world .	1
21607	Pathogen shedding by bats is a complex phenomenon regulated by host antiviral defenses and @GENE$	1
21608	A host ' s defenses attempt to control virus infection but viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract them [ 13 ]	1
21609	When the host defenses are suppressed , or if the virus is able to circumvent the host immune system , virus replication is enhanced , leading to an increase in virus shedding	1
21610	The route of shedding is highly dependent on the tissue in which the virus replication occurs	1
21611	For example , increased replication in the kidney would lead the bat to shed the virus in urine , whereas intestinal replication would result in dissemination through feces	1
21612	Therefore , it becomes important to study what factors might be responsible for decreasing the host defense or factors that allow the virus to circumvent host immune response	1
21613	But before exploring factors affecting virus - host interactions , it is imperative to understand the viruses present in bats and the bat immune defenses	1
21614	In 2013 - 2014 , bat immunology was at a nascent stage and Schountz and Baker et al	1
21615	[ 14 , 15 ] had summarized the preliminary knowledge about it in their reviews	1
21616	In 2017 , Schountz et al	1
21617	[ 16 ] again reviewed bat immunology but the article also laid out gaps in our understanding of host pathogen interactions in bats	1
21618	Here , we include more recent advances in characterizing the bat immune system including a possible link between the evolution of flight in bats and viral persistence	1
21619	Following that section , we discuss the factors identified so far that upset the balanced bat - virus relationship , potentially leading to the spillover of viruses .	1
21620	To assess the effects of G2 / M phase synchronization , cells were cultured in medium or were treated with 25 ng / ml nocodazole for 24 h ; then , the cells were mock infected or were infected with EV - D68 at 0	1
21621	8 MOI for 2 h , and cultured in fresh medium or 25 ng / ml nocodazole for another 24 h ( Figure 1I )	1
21622	Nododazole induced obvious G2 / M arrest ( P < 0	1
21623	001 ; Figure 1J )	1
21624	At 2 h post - infection , there was no significant difference in the @GENE$ level in the control and G2 / M phase - synchronized cells ( Figure 1M ) ; however , at 24 h post - infection the genomic level was lower in the synchronized cells than in the control cells ( P < 0	1
21625	05 ; Figure 1K )	1
21626	Furthermore , at 24 h post - infection the TCID50 / mL for supernatant from the G2 / M phase - synchronized cells ( 0	1
21627	46 ± 0	1
21628	29 × 10 5 ) was obviously lower than that from the control cells ( 1	1
21629	40 ± 0	1
21630	16 × 10 5 ) ( P < 0	1
21631	01 ; Figure 1L )	1
21632	Therefore , these results suggest that G2 / M synchronization does not affect viral entry , but inhibits EV - D68 viral replication and production .	1
21633	Cytolytic cell activation can be measured using @GENE$ , a marker of degranulation [ 15 ]	1
21634	The ratio of CD8 + CD107a + cells to all CD8 T cells significantly increased in rVV - N25 - treated splenocytes after co - culture with EL - 4CN2 or EL - 4NS2 ( P , 0	1
21635	05 ) , whereas splenocytes that had been treated with any other rVV were not detected ( Figure 5A , B and C )	1
21636	These results indicated that rVV - @GENE$ treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2specific activated CD8 T cells	1
21637	Consistent with these results , the ratio of CD8 + IFN - c + cells to all CD8 T cells for rVV - @GENE$ - treated mice was also significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV ( P , 0	1
21638	05 )	1
21639	Taken together , these findings indicated that rVV - N25 induced an effective CD8 T - cell immune response and that @GENE$ is an important @GENE$ for CD8 T cells .	1
21640	Since 1997 , G1 - lineage H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been circulating in Asia and later on in the Middle East , and they have been associated to mild @DISEASE$ , drops in egg production and moderate mortality in chickens , in particular in the presence of concurrent infections	1
21641	In this study , we investigated the importance of the G1 - lineage H9N2 A / chicken / Israel / 1163 / 2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers , analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues , and investigating the long - term impact on egg production	1
21642	Besides causing a mild @DISEASE$ , the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60 % of the hens causing different degrees of @DISEASE$ throughout the organ , in particular at the level of the infundibulum , where the detection of the virus was associated with severe @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$	1
21643	Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct	1
21644	The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post - infection ( pi ) ( 60 % decrease ) and continued up to 80 days pi ( 35 % decrease )	1
21645	On day 80 pi , non - laying birds showed @DISEASE$ , and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal	1
21646	Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens , and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct , compromising the commercial life of birds .	1
21647	The Chr2 : 68	1
21648	8 6 0	1
21649	4 Mb interval contained nine genes , three of which were expressed at appreciable levels in adult lung ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) but only two had known roles in gene regulation ( @GENE$ ) or cell signaling ( @GENE$ ) ( Table 3 )	1
21650	@GENE$ has been shown to be required for vascular development and angiogenesis by acting as a molecular conduit for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) - mediated induction of Ras - related @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) activity ( Kovacevic et al	1
21651	2012 )	1
21652	Interestingly , @GENE$ has been shown in both mice ( Kim et al	1
21653	2005 ) and humans ( Wiesenthal et al	1
21654	2009 ) to bind to and negatively regulate transcription of its own promoter via a centrally located @GENE$ ( Bae et al	1
21655	2014 ) .	1
21656	The DIs @GENE$ and @GENE$ , which share the same cellular targets , namely @GENE$ and @GENE$ , but not the @GENE$ specific DI P5091 , exhibit antiretroviral activity indicating that @GENE$ alone or together with @GENE$ might play a major role in HIV - 1 replication	1
21657	It has been shown previously that @GENE$ is specific for the cleavage of @GENE$ and thus prevents the proteasomal degradation of substrates [ 88 ]	1
21658	We could show that treatment with DIs targeting @GENE$ leads to an enhanced polyubiquitination and entry of @GENE$ into the @GENE$ pathway , indicating that @GENE$ somehow interacts with @GENE$ and prevents its entry into the UPS .	1
21659	By blocking the deubiquitination of @GENE$ , the DIs P22077 and @GENE$ should also increase steady state levels of @GENE$ and thus its entry into the UPS	1
21660	To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiquitin ( @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs	1
21661	The @GENE$ , which was shown to display elevated levels of @GENE$ , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ]	1
21662	To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of @GENE$ following DI treatment , cells were incubated with the @GENE$ inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis	1
21663	After immunoprecipitation with @GENE$ , western blot analyses were performed and @GENE$ were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 )	1
21664	Following co - expression of @GENE$ and @GENE$ , a faint pattern of @GENE$ was observed , which most likely represents @GENE$	1
21665	Upon treatment with 14 µM PR - 619 or 20 µM P22077 , the intensity of the @GENE$ - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels of the @GENE$	1
21666	Similar amounts of @GENE$ were confirmed by anti - CA staining	1
21667	Thus , treatment with @GENE$ or @GENE$ enhances polyubiquitination of @GENE$ .	1
21668	Authors ' contributions MS contributed towards all the molecular biology work , transfection work and @GENE$ and pulse - chase assays and acquisition of data and data analysis and interpretation BV contributed to the RNA based work and ChIP assays and revised the manuscript critically SKL was involved in conception and design drafting initial experiments and later the manuscript	1
21669	Each author has participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content	1
21670	All authors read and approved the final manuscript .	1
21671	Expression of @GENE$ , which is known to be a transcriptional target of @GENE$ , was down - regulated in LPS treated ORF2 expressing cells presumably due to reduced promoter occupancy of @GENE$ , which is crucial for @GENE$ dependent transcriptional activation	1
21672	In an infected cell , by default , @GENE$ are processed by the @GENE$ and presented by the @GENE$ so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells	1
21673	This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection	1
21674	Thus , it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step	1
21675	In fact , downregulation of @GENE$ both at transcriptional and post - translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]	1
21676	Since @GENE$ is one of the major @GENE$ induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many @GENE$ and @GENE$ in the infected cell , inhibition of the @GENE$ activity by @GENE$ will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage ; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection .	1
21677	Alternatively , @GENE$ have been proposed to sterically rigidify membranes in which they insert leading to fusion inhibition , as recently proposed [ 26 ]	1
21678	This hypothesis is supported by the finding that @GENE$ can interact between themselves , although the extent of this multimerization has not been fully examined [ 49 ]	1
21679	Whether these mechanisms are at play here and more importantly whether the same mechanism / s of inhibition is at play in target cells and in virion particles remains to be determined .	1
21680	Lastly , we silenced @GENE$ in Jurkat cells and since @GENE$ were moderately upregulated upon @GENE$ treatment , we compared the effects that @GENE$ played on viral replication in both control or IFITM - knockdown cells ( Figure 5C )	1
21681	Silenced cells were challenged with replication competent @GENE$ and viral replication was monitored through the accumulation of @GENE$ in the culture supernatants at different days post infection	1
21682	Under these conditions , viral replication was increased by @GENE$ silencing in both IFN - stimulated and unstimulated conditions over control silenced cells , indicating that @GENE$ may provide already a basal level of resistance even in non stimulated Jurkat T cells	1
21683	Given that in addition to the direct decrease in viral particles infectivity that we describe here , @GENE$ have been previously described to affect the entry of HIV - 1 when expressed in target cells [ 9 ] and given that the assay of spreading infection does not allow the distinction between these two effects , viral particles retrieved at the end of the culture were normalized by @GENE$ activity and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells to determine their intrinsic infectivity in a single round infection assay ( Figure 5D )	1
21684	Under these conditions , the infectivity of viral particles produced in IFITM - knockdown cells was higher than the one of viruses produced in control cells and this increase was of 1 , 6 fold in unstimulated Jurkat cells , but reached 5 fold in IFN - stimulated cells , suggesting again that @GENE$ do play an antiviral role in Jurkat cells that is exacerbated upon @GENE$ stimulation	1
21685	Of note , we have already determined that @GENE$ does not influence the early phases of infection in HeLa cells [ 43 ] , so that its presence is unlikely to be a confounding factor in the determination of the infectivity of viral particles in this cell type	1
21686	Overall , these results further strengthen the notion that @GENE$ negatively interfere with the infectivity of HIV - 1 viral particles and do so in different cell types in which they are naturally expressed .	1
21687	Samples were collected with Bolt LDS Buffer and Bolt Reducing Agent ( Invitrogen , Waltham , MA , USA ) and run on polyacrylamide gels	1
21688	Gels were transferred using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device ( Invitrogen )	1
21689	Membranes were probed with @GENE$ for @GENE$ , ( 1 : 1000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX , USA ) , @GENE$ ( 1 : 1000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and @GENE$ ( 1 : 5000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology )	1
21690	Membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) and visualized on FluorChem E imager ( Protein Simple , San Jose , CA , USA ) .	1

21692	Nurse ( N3 ) said : " Most of the patient are critically ill	1
21693	Most of them report to the hospital when their conditions have deteriorated	1
21694	They first go to traditional healers for help	1
21695	" Nurse ( N1 ) indicated that : " Even when patients are diagnosed with @DISEASE$ they will still go to traditional healers for help because they do not believe they are ill ; rather they believe that they have been bewitched	1
21696	Some of them won ' t even disclose their status to their family members because of fear of being stigmatized	1

21702	These colonies were kept in nesting tubes ( 155 mm length , 14 inner diameters ) and fed with Drosophila hydei and sugar - water ad libitum ( 40 % mass fraction of sugar )	1
21703	For the experiment , the colonies were transferred into boxes ( 60 × 70 × 15 mm ) attached to a foraging arena ( 200 × 150 × 120 mm )	1
21704	Humidity in the nest was maintained with a moist cotton ball	1
21705	Red foil covered the nest boxes to reduce stress [ 51 ]	1
21706	The foraging arenas had an opening covered with removable insect nets and the edges were covered with paraffin oil to minimize escape	1
21707	The colonies were maintained at RT ( 19 - 23 • C ) with a natural day / night cycle .	1
21708	To date , there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis or standardization of H	1

21711	Therefore , an HPLC - UV method was developed and validated for quantification of lycorine in various H	1

21713	Lycorine absorbed maximum UV wavelength at 325 nm , which was selected as detection wavelength	1
21714	The wavelength selected differs from previous reports which ranged between 287 and 292 nm [ 2 , 7 , 14 ]	1
21715	Lycorine was eluted in the present HPLC method within 5 min and the total run time was 10 min .	1

21718	The disorganized and delayed response has been labeled a global health governance failure by Roemer - Mahler and Rushton ( 2016 ) who argue that @DISEASE$ outbreak was not only a global health problem but also a global political problem ^ ( p	1
21719	374 ) ( Siegel 2015 )	1
21720	Siegel ( 2015 ) echoes a similar criticism in noting that development aid was used in contexts with insufficient infrastructures for the aid to be effective and focused too heavily on issues unrelated to Ebola ( Nunes 2016 )	1
21721	The international responses are argued to be far too short term , framing the @DISEASE$ epidemic as an African , and therefore racialized problem ( Jones 2011 ) , leading to global neglect of the disease	1
21722	This scholarly evaluation of global responses to the @DISEASE$ virus politicizes the epidemic , calling into question the evidence used to inform response pathways , which were largely insufficient and inappropriate for the Liberian context	1
21723	More credible sources of evidence would have considered the urgency of @DISEASE$ and the unique sociopolitical context in which it was spreading .	1
21724	This systematic review of the politics of three different outbreaks in three different social economic contexts revealed that the politics of epidemics are - to an extent - universal	1
21725	However , the manner by which the politics are played out vary by the income setting , the political themes that speak to general epidemics were found to be uniquely enacted during the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Toronto , the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Brazil , and the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Liberia .	1
21726	Australian case data were extracted from a national online companion animal disease surveillance - reporting database launched in January 2010 [ 10 ] and from the medical records of animal shelters and / or veterinary hospitals in outbreak regions for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 August 2018	1
21727	Data recorded included case occurrence date , shelter location , shelter post code , age at diagnosis , sex , post code of owner residence or where found as a stray before entry into shelter , clinical signs at presentation , date of last vaccination , vaccination type ( inactivated or modified live virus ( MLV ) vaccine ) , time interval between last vaccination and onset of clinical signs ( days ) , method of diagnosis and outcome	1
21728	Data obtained were searched to identify cases for which serial monitoring of faecal shedding of FPV or CPV using qPCR testing had been performed	1
21729	Information about animal movements , biosecurity and vaccination protocols was obtained from shelter veterinarians and / or managers	1
21730	New Zealand case data were obtained from one shelter , comprising summary data of case diagnoses for two @DISEASE$ outbreaks occurring between 2016 and 2018 as well as individual data for 9 cases in which clinical samples were available for PCR and sequencing	1

21743	Briefly , RNA was extracted by adding chloroform prior to centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 15 min at 4 ° C	1
21744	RNA was then precipitated with isopropyl alcohol , washed with 75 % ethanol , and resuspended in RNase - free water	1

21747	Gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) using SYBR Green or Taqman master mixes on a 7500 Fast real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA )	1
21748	SYBR Green primers used for transcripts were as follows : GADPH , 5 ′ - TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; JHMV nucleocapsid , 5 ′ - CGCAGAGTATGGCGACGAT - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GAGGTCCTAGTCTCGGCCTGTT - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; IL - 2 , 5 ′ - CAGGATGGAGAATTACAGGAACCT - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - TTT CAATTCTGTGGCCTGCTT - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; CCL5 , 5 ′ - GCAA GTGCTCCAATCTTGCA - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - CTTCTCTGGGTT GGCACACA - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; CXCL9 , 5 ′ - TGCACGATGCTCCT GCA - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - AGGTCTTTGAGGGATTTGTAGTGG - 3 ′ ( antisense ) ; and CXCL10 , 5 ′ - GACGGTCCGCTGCAACTG - 3 ′ ( sense ) and 5 ′ - GCTTCCCTATGGCCCTCATT - 3 ′ ( antisense )	1
21749	GAPDH , interferon gamma ( IFN - γ ) , and CCL2 mRNA levels were determined using TaqMan primers	1
21750	Transcript levels were normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH by using the formula 2 [ Ct ( GAPDH ) − Ct ( gene ) ] × 1 , 000 , where Ct represents the threshold cycle value .	1
21751	Owners were instructed to call the veterinary clinic if the cat did not consume the food , had a reduced appetite , reduction in body weight , or any other concerns	1
21752	On day 14 , the owner was called by a veterinary technician to confirm that cat was eating well , had not lost weight , and did not have any concerns or significant decline in their clinical condition	1
21753	On day 28 , the cats returned to the clinic for a final examination and diagnostic recheck ( CBC , serum chemistry profile , and Spec fPL ) .	1
21754	As shown in Figure 7 , the moving person also receives a high intake dose and has a high exposure level	1

21763	Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were maintained in a diurnal cycle ( 12h / 12h ) with temperatures alternating for 23 and26 ° C and 65 % humidity	1

21765	13 × 10 ^ 6 pfu / ml ) or 199 medium ( as control ) and the mosquitoes were incubated at 25 ° C and 65 % humidity in an environmental cabinet ( Thermoline Scientific , Smithfield , Australia ) with a wet cotton pad ( 10 % sucrose solution ) provided daily as a food source	1
21766	At 24 hpi , surviving females were collected for analysis	1
21767	For this , mosquito midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead - beater	1
21768	RNA extracted using the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) by pooling four samples and was used for realtime RT - qPCR as described above .	1
21769	Lavander ( Lavandula angustifolia ) oil , as reported above , was the most effective against lipid peroxidation [ 42 ]	1
21770	Concerning free radical - scavenging activity , lavender essential oil also exhibited the highest DPPH - scavenging activity , neverthelesss in the ABTS - scavenging activity , the best oils were those of Mentha x piperita L and Boswellia carteri Birdw	1
21771	In the DPPH method , limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia , although linalool and linalyl acetate constituted the major components of this essential oil	1

21776	In this work we present Iterative HFold , a fast and robust iterative algorithm that matches the accuracy of the best existing pseudoknot prediction methods	1
21777	Iterative HFold is significantly more accurate than IPknot while matching the accuracy of @GENE$ on the HK - PK data set	1
21778	Iterative HFold is superior to both @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the IP - pk168 data set	1
21779	Moreover both Iterative HFold and @GENE$ use less memory and run much faster than @GENE$ on long sequences .	1
21780	Often , partial information about @GENE$ big is not available ; this is the case for many @GENE$ of unknown function reported by the ENCODE consortium [ 24 ]	1
21781	Therefore , we next compare the quality of results obtained by @GENE$ , @GENE$ and Iterative @GENE$ when given a pseudoknot - free input , @GENE$ that is predicted by existing computational methods	1
21782	One way to produce an input structure is to use an MFE pseudoknot - free structure prediction method , such as MFold	1
21783	We chose @GENE$ as it is an implementation of @GENE$ and , because of its energy parameters , gives more accurate predictions than @GENE$	1
21784	Of course , when comparative information is available , the user can input such information as structural constraint as a pseudoknot - free structure to Iterative @GENE$ and expect a better prediction result	1
21785	Here we compare two methods for predicting @GENE$ , namely @GENE$ and the hotspots produced by @GENE$ V2	1

21787	Table 2 reports the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals of average F - measures	1
21788	The accuracy of @GENE$ is significantly worse than that of @GENE$ and Iterative @GENE$ , both with the output of @GENE$ , and with the @GENE$ as input , so we do not discuss @GENE$ further .	1
21789	The study was conducted in two regions of the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) , specifically the City of Toronto proper and the Regional Municipality of York located directly to the north of Toronto	1
21790	The GTA is among the largest metropolitan areas in North America with a population exceeding 5	1
21791	5 million [ 18 ]	1
21792	As the urban centre of the GTA , the City of Toronto is a densely - populated , cosmopolitan city ( population estimate : 2 , 500 , 000 ; population density : 3 , 972 / km 2 ; visible minority population : 46 % )	1
21793	In contrast , York is a much less - densely populated suburban region comprised of several small cities and towns ( population estimate : 900 , 000 ; population density : 506	1

21804	Consequently , the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] , owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period - wise or timeseries manner [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] , where the preferred one in the LMDI [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ]	1
21805	By means of LMDI method , Wang et al	1
21806	[ 46 ] investigated the main driver for industrial carbon emissions in Beijing - Tianjin - Hebei economic band from 1996 to 2010 , and the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors	1
21807	Wang et al	1
21808	[ 42 ] decomposed the influencing factors of residential carbon emissions in Beijing and found that the rising per capita GDP and the declining energy intensity contributed the most to emissions changes during 2000 to 2010	1
21809	Similar results , conducted by Wang et al	1
21810	[ 54 ] , can also be found in Suzhou city	1
21811	Zhao et al	1
21812	[ 49 ] decomposed the main drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai and found that industrial output , energy intensity , energy and industrial structure were major determinants for emissions changes	1
21813	Shao et al	1
21814	[ 50 ] adopted an extended LMDI method and investigated the techno - economic drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai , and the results showed that industrial output scale was mainly responsible for emission increments while industrial structure adjustment , R & D intensity , and energy intensity were most significant factors in mitigating emissions	1
21815	Kang et al	1
21816	[ 51 ] performed a multi - sectoral decomposition analysis of city - level greenhouse gas emissions in Tianjin from 2001 to 2009 , including the agricultural , industrial , transportation , commercial and other sectors , and the results showed that economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments while energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions	1
21817	Hopefully , previous studies about driving factors and influencing mechanisms of city - level carbon emissions performed on China ' s megacities such as Beijing , Shanghai etc	1
21818	, have made great contributions to the realization of regional low - carbon road map	1
21819	But , the previous LMDI studies mainly focused on the economic growth effect , the energy intensity effect , the population size effect , and the technology progress effect influencing the change of carbon emissions	1
21820	It fails to distinguish the effects of economic structure , population structure , and energy structure on the change of carbon emissions	1
21821	In fact , the strongest factors that offset China ' s energy consumption and carbon emissions have shifted from efficiency gains to structural changes [ 74 , 75 ]	1
21822	Structural indicators combined with other traditional and emerging factors should also be deeply considered and investigated in China ' s regional energy and carbon researches , which may perform different influencing mechanism in different regions during different development stages	1
21823	Compared with four municipalities , there were relatively few studies conducting on Guangzhou city , one of China ' s first - tier cities , with the considerable GDP scale and total energy consumption amount ( Table 2 )	1
21824	Meanwhile , Guangzhou has the highest level of per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption than the four municipalities	1
21825	Guangzhou is the provincial capital of Guangdong province , the most developed coastal region in the southeast of China ( Fig 1 )	1
21826	In addition , Guangzhou city is an important manufacturing base in China as well as a pilot zone for low - carbon city announced by China ' s National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) in 2012	1
21827	Therefore , Guangzhou city may serve as a demonstration of how to realize the targets of low - carbon city development , thereby highlighting the importance and representativeness of studying its features and drivers for carbon emissions in detail .	1
21828	Many participants believed that unless @DISEASE$ ' s potential damage to the population and the economy is projected , people are not going to take @DISEASE$ seriously	1
21829	Some participants mentioned that only a grave incident such as an @DISEASE$ outbreak would be able to catch the attention of the general public and extend the prevention efforts of @DISEASE$ .	1
21830	Singapore ' s MOH was unanimously praised by all participants in its proactive approach towards AMR and making way for changes amid very complex issues	1
21831	It was mentioned that the MOH was transparent and accountable and was operating an efficient public healthcare system in Singapore	1
21832	Yet , as a drawback some participants argued that having a system that relies too much on decisions made at the highest political level makes the general population and service providers inert .	1
21833	In the newly established @DISEASE$ method , the population effect ( ΔC p - effect ) , the affluence effect ( ΔC g - effect ) , the energy intensity effect ( ΔC e - effect ) , the economic structure effect ( ΔC s - effect ) , and the carbon intensity effect ( ΔC f - effect )	1
21834	In addition , social and economic factors such as urbanization ( ΔC UR - effect ) , family income in urban and rural households ( ΔC AI - effect ) were analyzed to further explain the changes of carbon emissions at the city level .	1
21835	Similar to HSV , PRV also showed similar antiviral effects in the three 3D8 scFv cell lines and one mutant cell line	1
21836	Forty - eight hours after the @DISEASE$ challenge , fewer cytopathic effects , as assessed by multinuclear giant cell formation , were observed in SCH07072 cells compared to the other types of cells , including wild - type cells ( Figure 3A )	1
21837	The plaque assay also showed the highest antiviral effects in SCH07072 cells with viral titers of 916 / ml and 7 , 466 / ml at MOIs of 0	1
21838	1 and 0	1
21839	5 , respectively , compared to those of wildtype HeLa cells ( 9 , 130 / ml and 31 , 833 / ml , respectively ) and the muSCH cell line ( 9	1
21840	046 / ml and 30 , 400 / ml , respectively ( Figure 3B )	1
21841	The expression leve@GENE$  scFv in SCH07071 and SCH07072 cells were similar ( Figure 1B ) but the antiviral activity of SCH07072 and SCH07071 were quite different	1
21842	Generally there is a correlation be@GENE$  scFv expression and antiviral activity	1
21843	However , in order for cells to acquire the antiviral activi@GENE$  scFv , a certain amou@GENE$ otein needs to be expressed	1
21844	We thought that there might be a threshold for the acquired antiviral activity conferr@GENE$  scFv expression	1
21845	SCH07072 may have reached the threshold but SCH07071 did not ( Figure 3@GENE$ ei@GENE$ ( gpD ) was used for Western analysis to count the PRV @GENE$ otein was not found in the SCH07072 lines but wild - type HeLa cells showed strong signals ( Figure 3C )	1
21846	Even though the expression lev@GENE$  scFv in SCH07041 cells was significantly lower ( approx	1
21847	1 / 3 ) than that of SCH07072 cells , both cells were found to be equally resistant against @DISEASE$ infection at an MOI of 0	1
21848	1 ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting t@GENE$ protein level in SCH07041 cells was close to the maximum effective dose against HSV - 1	1
21849	At a higher virus titer ( MOI 0	1
21850	5 ) , the antiviral effect of 3D8 scFv was shown in a more dose - dependent manner such that much less viral infectivity was found in the SCH07072 cells than the SCH07041 ( 1 , 964	1
21851	00 vs 530	1
21852	67 pfu / ml )	1
21853	This was further demonstrated in case of PRV infection study ( Figure 3B ) , in which the SCH07072 cells were shown to be more resistant against the virus infection than the SCH07041 cells at both MOI of 0	1
21854	1 and 0	1
21855	5	1
21856	As a result , 3D8 scFv expression levels and antiviral effects showed a directly proportional relationship	1
21857	3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) in transgenic cell lines	1
21858	The relative concentrations of 3D8 scFv were calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta C T method	1

21879	Two @DISEASE$ outbreaks occurred in Wellington , New Zealand , in December 2016 and January 2018	1
21880	The seasonal distribution of cases in the second outbreak is shown in Figure 3	1
21881	In total , 365 cases of @DISEASE$ were diagnosed , including 167 in the first outbreak and 198 in the second	1
21882	During both outbreaks , 8 % of feline admissions to the shelter were diagnosed with @DISEASE$	1
21883	The median age at diagnosis was 9 weeks ( IQR 6 - 14 weeks , range 2 - 105 weeks )	1
21884	At diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , 32 % of cats were unvaccinated , 58 % had received one vaccine , 8 % had been vaccinated twice , and 2 % had been vaccinated three times	1

21939	Since @GENE$ inhibitors are substrate analogues and typically exhibit competitive kinetics , it is interesting to explore natural non - substrate mimics such as flavonoids , ( oligo ) stilbenes , coumarins and diarylheptanoids ( Grienke et al	1
21940	, 2012 )	1
21941	Flavonoids , which are polyphenolic compounds , are widespread in the plant kingdom and are known to show antibacterial and antiviral effects ( Liu et al	1
21942	, 2008 ; Jeong et al	1
21943	, 2009 ; Grienke et al	1
21944	, 2012 )	1
21945	Natural flavonoids have also been reported to have latent anti - influenza and antibacterial effects against SARS ( @DISEASE$ , MRSA ( methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) and @DISEASE$ mediated by a trypanosome ( Arioka et al	1
21946	, 2010 ; Cho et al	1
21947	, 2013 ; Navrá tilová et al	1
21948	, 2013 ) .	1
21949	Here , we present a case report of a 7 - month old infant with laboratory - confirmed @DISEASE$ who presented with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ at the BCG inoculation site .	1
21950	A pathologic study on seven samples from later timepoints ( most greater than two weeks after beginning symptoms of @DISEASE$ ) revealed fewer IgM + plasma cells compared to more prevalent IgA + plasma cells	1
21951	These were seemingly specific and prominent in seven @DISEASE$ biopsy specimens , however the fourteen control specimens were from autopsies that succumbed generally from @DISEASE$	1
21952	Notably , mature memory and immature B cells ( CD20 + cells ) were lacking [ 83 ]	1
21953	Due to the late time point of these specimens , this may not be inconsistent with other reports reviewed previously	1
21954	The lack of CD20 + B cells was theorized to be from early coronary infiltration of CD20 + B cells followed by immediate switching of these B cells to plasma cells [ 84 ]	1
21955	This increase in infiltrative IgA + plasma cells could not be explained by a generalized increase in peripheral IgA + cell , as none was shown in acute or convalescent @DISEASE$ [ 3 ]	1
21956	The largest study , relying on electron microscopic studies , suggests that there is an early @DISEASE$ indicative of an @DISEASE$ , followed by a @DISEASE$ , then luminal myofibroblast proliferation [ 77 ]	1
21957	Although this study had 32 samples , it only had three within two weeks of disease onset and a number of findings were different than previous studies	1
21958	Collection and study of these types of rare samples should continue .	1

22022	These viruses were detected in the faeces collected from two cats in the same shelter in Sydney , NSW , in November 2015	1
22023	Both cats had severe @DISEASE$ and tested positive for @DISEASE$ spp	1
22024	and Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 on a multiplex faecal qPCR panel ( Idexx Pty Ltd	1
22025	)	1
22026	The largest Australian clade ( C ) comprised 66 viruses from NSW and one from Queensland , collected between December 2016 and February 2018	1
22027	Viruses collected from cats in North Western NSW ( Gunnedah ) and South Eastern Queensland ( Nambour ) in 2017 were identical to those sampled from cats from four shelters and from privately owned cats in Sydney	1
22028	Viruses from cats from the NSW Central Coast also fell into this clade	1
22029	Finally , one sequence isolated from a cat from Melbourne in 2018 ( FPV _ 251 ) was identical to viruses in clade C , with the exception of a mutation at position 694 ( A694G ) that resulted in an amino acid substitution I to V	1
22030	This mutation was also present in viruses in Clade A .	1
22031	The purpose of this study was to analyze @GENE$ levels using @GENE$ in normal controls , as well as patients with @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$ , and to verify those results using western blotting	1
22032	The ultimate aim was to identify the differen@GENE$ rotein levels that were closely associated with the progression of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ - induced @DISEASE$	1
22033	The results of this study may provide crucial information regarding viral mechanisms and the pathogenic process .	1

22051	At 48 h after infection , the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant MVA expressing the @GENE$ was clonally isolated by consecutive rounds of plaque purification in CEF by screening for transient co - expression of the red fluorescent marker protein @GENE$ .	1
22052	Research in Singapore was unanimously considered to be well promoted and funded , albeit it was also rated to be very competitive in terms of securing research funding	1
22053	There was ongoing @DISEASE$ research including in the areas of surveillance , prevention of transmission , whole genome sequencing , among others	1
22054	Of the various arms of @DISEASE$ research , surveillance was considered to be one of the main pillars in @DISEASE$ research : " One of the key reasons in the national action plan is research	1
22055	And among the research activities there have been sort of highlighted in terms of priority , is better surveillance	1

22059	Currently bat research within Western Asia is restricted and fragmented , primarily driven by a small number of dedicated individual researchers based at academic , government , and nongovernmental institutions	1
22060	These researchers are leading efforts to discover new species and address knowledge gaps in topics such as bat diversity , distribution , taxonomy , and conservation [ 93 , 98 , 102 , [ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ]	1
22061	A few existing networks in the region are aligned with @GENE$ and will be included as part of this multinational One Health initiative	1
22062	For example , the recently formed Bats of Eastern Europe , made up of bat experts from the Caucasus region , held their first international conference in October 2018 in Yerevan , Armenia [ 141 ]	1
22063	Also , entities such as The Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network ( EMPHNET ) based in Jordan and the Pak One Health Alliance of Pakistan are conducting critical work to improve public health outcomes and disease surveillance [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ]	1
22064	Despite the value and successes of these few established efforts , most research within the region remains either monodisciplinary , or limited in its geographic scope	1
22065	The @GENE$ aims to fill a critical need to facilitate interaction : ( 1 ) among bat researchers scattered throughout Western Asia , and ( 2 ) between bat conservationists and those conducting @DISEASE$ surveillance within the region	1
22066	Networking of existing bat researchers into a regional network , together with collaborative efforts to improve disease surveillance initiatives for humans and domestic animals , will help promote One Health solutions to regional threats [ 14 , 145 ] .	1

22081	TBEV is considered one of the most important arboviruses in central and eastern European countries and in Russia , with about 13 , 000 estimated human cases annually [ 24 ]	1
22082	In fact , over the last decade there has been an approximately 300 % increase in the number of @DISEASE$ cases in Europe [ 25 ] , and TBEV is currently spreading into new regions in France , Sweden , Norway , and Italy [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]	1
22083	This increase is thought to be due to growth in population and spread of ticks , which is promoted by factors including climate change , social and political change , and changes in the land use [ 30 , 31 ]	1
22084	The increased expansion in Europe also poses an increased risk for the population engaged in outdoor activities .	1
22085	During the first three post - pandemic seasons 2010 / 11 , 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13 , active screening of children with @DISEASE$ admitted to 24 paediatric intensive care units in Bavaria identified a total of 51 PCR - confirmed @DISEASE$ cases , resulting in annual incidence estimates of 1	1
22086	7 , 0	1
22087	7 , and 1	1
22088	8 influenza - associated PICU admissions per 100 , 000 children , respectively	1
22089	These figures would , by extrapolation , correspond to a total number of 559 children with influenza - associated @DISEASE$ admission in Germany within the 3 - year post - pandemic period , with an annual average of 186 children	1
22090	This is almost 28 times as high as the annual average of six to seven @DISEASE$ - associated @DISEASE$ admissions detected by nation - wide PICU surveillance in Germany during three pre - pandemic years without active screening [ 18 ]	1
22091	Furthermore , the incidence estimates for the subtype @GENE$ from our active screening study were higher in the first and third post - pandemic seasons ( 1	1
22092	35 and 1	1
22093	17 , respectively ) than previous incidence estimates for @DISEASE$ patients in the pandemic ( 0	1
22094	8 - 1	1
22095	0 ) and the first post - pandemic ( approximately 0	1
22096	4 ) season in Germany [ 19 , 20 ]	1
22097	Thus , our results indicate possible underreporting in previous studies , and show a continued high level of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated @DISEASE$ admissions even 3 years after the pandemic	1
22098	In our study , the proportions of children with bacteriaassociated complications ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ) were similar to the proportions observed during the pre - pandemic period , but appeared higher than those observed during the pandemic 2009 / 10 [ 19 ]	1
22099	The lower proportions observed during the pandemic might be explained by the time shift of the peak of @DISEASE$ cases , which was observed as early as November 2009 in Germany [ 19 ]	1
22100	Thus , the pandemic influenza peak did not coincide with the seasonal peak of Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterial pathogen most frequently associated with @DISEASE$ [ 23 ]	1
22101	Antiviral treatment patterns changed considerably during the post - pandemic period , with a decrease in the proportion of @DISEASE$ cases receiving oseltamivir from previously 50 % [ 18 ] and 61 % [ 19 ] to 19 %	1
22102	Oseltamivir is considered to be most advantageous when administered within the first 48 h of influenza disease	1
22103	The reduced use in the post - pandemic period may therefore be partly due to the fact that median time between onset of influenza symptoms and PICU admission was longer than during the pandemic ( 3 vs	1
22104	2 days [ 19 ] )	1
22105	Increasing uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the treatment of paediatric influenza may also have played a role [ 24 , 25 ]	1
22106	Post - pandemic oseltamivir treatment was associated with co - infections and longer PICU stay , suggesting that it were mainly children with severe complications or with serious underlying conditions who received this medication .	1
22107	Far - UVC lamps	1
22108	We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr - Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25 , 26	1
22109	The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15	1
22110	Each bandpass filter ( Omega Optical , Brattleboro , VT ) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of 25 nm and enables > 20 % transmission at 222 nm	1
22111	A UV spectrometer ( SPM - 002 - BT64 , Photon Control , BC , Canada ) with a sensitivity range between 190 nm and 400 nm was utilized to verify the 222 nm emission spectrum	1
22112	A deuterium lamp standard with a NIST - traceable spectral irradiance ( Newport Model 63945 , Irvine , CA ) was used to radiometrically calibrate the UV spectrometer	1
22113	An SM - 70 Ozone Monitor ( Aeroqual , Avondale , Auckland , New Zealand ) measured the ozone generation from the lamps to be < 0	1
22114	005 ppm , which is not a significant level to provide an antimicrobial effect to aerosolized viruses 27 .	1
22115	@GENE$ is also implicated in regulating the GABAergic system in mice	1
22116	Tomida et al	1
22117	( 2009 ) discovered that an inbred strain of mice ( CS strain ) known to have defects in circadian rhythms , also exhibits changes in @DISEASE$ behaviors consistent with an anti - depressive state	1
22118	Quantitative trait locus mapping of the @DISEASE$ mice identified a 3bp deletion in a conserved lysine ( K92 ) in U@GENE$  Importantly , U@GENE$ nock - out ( KO ) mice exhibit similar changes in @DISEASE$ ( Imai et al	1
22119	, 2013 ) and broad expression of a wild type USP46 tra@GENE$ escued these behaviors ( Tomida et al	1

22124	Cytology BAL - fluid was transported to the laboratory in a siliconized container on ice	1
22125	The fluid was filtered through nylon gauze	1

22130	Two hundred cells were examined for differential cell counts .	1
22131	Proteasomal inhibition has been shown previously to affect replication of a wide range of viruses in mammalian cells , including @DISEASE$ [ 40 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 41 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 42 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 43 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 44 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 45 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 46 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 47 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 48 ]	1
22132	Microarray studies have also shown that several ubiquitin - related genes are induce@GENE$ osquito cells [ 32 ]	1
22133	The ubiquitinproteasomal pathway is one of the major pathways involved in post - translational modifications , leading to degradation of proteins	1
22134	It has also been implicated in various stages of viral infection in mammalian cells including virus entry , replication and exit [ 49 ]	1
22135	The largest family of ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) is a group @GENE$ on@GENE$ n a RING domain , a structural motif com@GENE$ t cysteine and histidine residues that form the interface with E2 ( ubiquitin conjugating ) enzyme @GENE$ termined by variant RING ubiquitin ligases and also by m@GENE$ hat contain @GENE$ n	1

22137	These proteins have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell - cycle regulation and cell signaling	1
22138	Because of this , cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are fr@GENE$ o evade host immunity [ 33 ]	1
22139	Viruses redirect these ligases to select specific host proteins for degradation in order to prevent the host response and promote viral replication and dissemination	1
22140	For example , viruses have been shown to use cullins to prevent cellular apoptosi@GENE$ rading p53 [ 50 ] or inhibit the innate ant@GENE$ al response by blocking interferon signaling [ 30 ]	1

22142	Specifically , the V protein of simian virus 5 causes degradation of STAT1 [ 29 ] , while the parainfluenza virus V protein causes degradation of STAT2 via the Cul4A substrate adaptor DDB1 [ 52 ] .	1

22144	aerial parts and the correspondent composition was compared with those of the essential oil isolated by hydrodistillation	1
22145	The main components in both cases were p - cymene , γ - terpinene , linalool , thymol and carvacrol	1
22146	The percentages changed according to the method of extraction used , nevertheless p - cymene and thymol dominated in both cases	1
22147	The great difference was found to be the presence of thymoquinone in the volatile oil obtained through the supercritical fluid extraction	1
22148	The presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test , in which the lipidic substrate was sunflower oil [ 60 ] .	1
22149	Pathway analysis of differentially regulated transcripts was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis v9	1

22153	The DPPH method was also the sole one used by [ 63 ] , although the authors also performed the DPPH method but coupled to TLC ( thin layer chromatography ) , that allows determination of which compounds are resposnsible for antioxidant activity	1
22154	Using two tests based on the same principle but using diverse methodologies ( spectrophotometer and TLC ) , the authors were able to find the compounds responsible for such activities after separation by TLC	1
22155	The authors identified 1 , 8 - cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L	1
22156	. The same procedure was followed by other authors [ 64 ] for the oils of Aniba panurensis ( Meisn	1
22157	) Mez , Aniba rosaeodora Ducke and Licaria martiniana ( Mez ) Kostern	1
22158	, from Brazil	1
22159	The IC 50 values were generally > 1 , 000 μg / mL , substantially superior to that of quercetin , the reference used by the authors	1
22160	Such low activity was attributed to the absence or to the very low concentrations of some compounds responsible for antioxidant activity - β - caryophyllene along with phenolic compounds	1
22161	Once again , and as reported above , such results might be enough for the authors to decide not to do other assays .	1
22162	Bat research networks have increased in number , largely as collaborative efforts to combat regional threats that traverse country boundaries [ 21 ]	1
22163	Yet a number of geographic regions lack coordinated bat research networks , most notably Western Asia [ 4 ] , a region of 20 countries extending from Turkey in the west , Georgia in the north , Yemen in the south , and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east	1
22164	Furthermore , most bat research networks are not integrated with the @DISEASE$ or viral research communities	1
22165	Given the potential of Western Asia as an emerging @DISEASE$ hotspot [ 22 ] , and @DISEASE$ hotspot in particular [ 9 , 23 ] , surveillance initiatives focused on @DISEASE$ in Western Asia are warranted	1
22166	In this review , we discuss the importance of collaboration between bat research networks and virus surveillance initiatives to understand the role of human activities in the transmission and spread of @DISEASE$	1
22167	We conduct a literature review to assess research effort on bats and bat - associated viruses around the world , and demonstrate that Western Asia constitutes a research gap , lacking an established bat research network and has limited published research on bats and their associated viruses	1
22168	Lastly , we outline a new regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia ( i	1
22169	e	1
22170	, the Western Asia Bat Research Network , WAB - Net ) , with the unique aim of taking an integrated approach to untangle host - virus dynamics to find " win - win " solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region .	1
22171	@GENE$ mediates the cell proliferation and increased expression and activation of @GENE$ induced by PGE 2 in HBEc14 - KT and BEAS2B cells PGE 2 binds to and activates four distinct receptor subtypes named @GENE$	1
22172	@GENE$ has been shown to a target molecule in @DISEASE$ cell proliferation [ 19 ]	1
22173	To investigate the mechanisms involved in PGE 2 - mediated bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , we transfected cells wi@GENE$ NA or pre - treated cells with t@GENE$ P4 antagonist AH23848 ( 10 μM )	1
22174	After pre - treatment wi@GENE$ NA or antagonist , cell proliferations induced by PGE 2 decreased ( Fig	1

22199	So we conclude th@GENE$ P4 mediates cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells .	1
22200	Understanding the role of genetic variants within a viral population is a necessary step toward predicting and treating emerging @DISEASE$	1
22201	The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases	1
22202	The genetic diversity of a viral population within a host may allow the virus to adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures and enable cross - species transmission events	1
22203	In 2009 a large outbreak of @DISEASE$ in Northern California involved a @DISEASE$ virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes , suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species	1
22204	To better understand the evolution of @DISEASE$ virus that enabled this host jump , we applied deep - sequencing analysis to @DISEASE$ virus samples from the outbreak	1
22205	Deepsequencing data indicated that many of the genetic changes associated with host jump occurred prior to 2009 , and these mutations were present at very low frequencies in viral populations from samples dating back to 1995	1
22206	These results suggest deep sequencing is useful for characterization of viral populations , and may provide insight to ance@GENE$ role of rare variants in viral emergence .	1

22208	Molecular Typing and Epidemiology Profiles of Human Adenovirus Infection among Paediatric Patients with @DISEASE$ in China	1
22209	It is often difficult to compare results between studies , because of the variability in the dose of CS used , treatment duration , and the experimental design of the study	1
22210	In Table 1 , we have summarized the main results reported in the literature concerning fecal E	1

22218	In order to evaluate the effect of colistin on fecal E	1
22219	coli shedding , bacterial quantification was performed in most studies using culture methods [ 28 , 77 ] , whereas other studies used real - time PCR [ 79 , 80 ]	1
22220	Furthermore , the oral use of a high dose of colistin in healthy piglets was not associated with a major perturbation in the pig gut microbiota as demonstrated by a high - throughput sequencing method [ 80 ] .	1
22221	After bacterial lysis , DNA was extracted using the EasyMag extraction system ( BioMerieux , Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam ) , according to manufacturer ' s instructions and subjected to consecutive monoplex PCR reactions ( CSF samples ) .	1
22222	Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito - borne @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
22223	Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually , further increasing the exposure risk for this virus	1
22224	Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of @DISEASE$ and additional @DISEASE$ in infants of @DISEASE$ - infected mothers , as well as a rise in the occurrence of @DISEASE$ in infected adults	1
22225	Importantly , there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against @DISEASE$	1
22226	In this study , we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel , synthetic , DNA vaccine targeting the pre - membrane + envelope prot@GENE$ ni@GENE$ in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct , mice and non - human primates were immunised with this prME DNA - based immunogen thr@GENE$ electroporation - mediated enhanced DNA delivery	1

22230	This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in @DISEASE$ and suggests t@GENE$ dditional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for @DISEASE$ control and disease prevention in humans .	1
22231	@DISEASE$ ( ZIKV ) is a single - stranded , positive sense RNA flavivirus , 1 spread primarily through the bite of infected @DISEASE$ mosquitos	1
22232	[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] However , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , novel mechanisms of @DISEASE$ transmission have been described including sexual and transplacental transmission	1
22233	[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia and has spread unabated through South America , Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2 years	1
22234	8 , 9 Factors including increased global travel and an expansion of the range of @DISEASE$ mosquitos owing to climate change portend further spread of this virus , expanding its range in the southern United States over the next few years	1
22235	5 , 9 @DISEASE$ presents with a prodrome of @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and low - grade fever with a rash appearing approximately 7 days post infection that may occur with @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
22236	The clinical presentation is similar to , albeit less severe than , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , which are also transmitted through the same mosquito vectors	1
22237	During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013 , an increased risk of @DISEASE$ was identified in infected individuals	1
22238	4 , 6 , 10 Alarmingly , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , @DISEASE$ and other @DISEASE$ in infants have been observed in mothers who were infected by ZIKV during pregnancy	1
22239	[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In April 2016 , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the link between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ establishing ZIKV as a teratogen	1
22240	There are currently no licensed therapies or vaccines against @DISEASE$	1
22241	Therefore , the development and evaluation of potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent is of high priority	1
22242	14 Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic ZIKV prME DNA vaccine delivered by electroporation for its immunogenici@GENE$ act on @DISEASE$ in a pathogenic animal challenge model	1
22243	1	1
22244	There appears to be a genetic influence in exhibiting @DISEASE$	1
22245	Incidence is higher in some genetic backgrounds and consistently appears in males greater than females within those backgrounds [ 16 ]	1
22246	By age five in the United States , 1 in 1000 African - American children and 1 in 2000 Caucasian children will have been affected [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ]	1
22247	In general , Asians have a much higher rate of @DISEASE$ , this is especially evident in Japanese children , whose lifetime incidence rate is near 1 % [ 20 ]	1
22248	This predisposition holds even for those persons of Japanese heritage raised in foreign lands , such as the United States [ 16 ] .	1
22249	Apart from some minor editing , as indicated in the attachment , my comments mainly aim to improve the reader ' s understanding	1
22250	The areas requiring clarification are highlighted in the attachment together with some comments	1
22251	The two most important ones are as follows :	1
22252	A wide range of viral , bacterial and fungal agents can cause @DISEASE$ when aspirated into the lungs	1
22253	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Etiology of @DISEASE$ in the Community ( EPIC ) study identified viruses as the most commonly identified etiologic agent in children and adults hospitalized with @DISEASE$	1
22254	An etiologic agent was detected in 81 % of 2222 children < 18 years of age : 66 % had one or more viral pathogens , 8 % one or more bacterial pathogens and 7 % both bacterial and viral pathogens [ 5 ]	1
22255	Among 2259 adults , an etiologic agent was detected in 38 % : 23 % had one or more viral pathogens , 11 % one or more bacterial pathogens and 3 % both bacterial and viral pathogens [ 6 ]	1
22256	However , virtually all these serious @DISEASE$ cases were treated with antibiotics , as secondary bacterial infection can complicate lower @DISEASE$	1
22257	Therefore , even in cases determined to be pneumonia solely of viral etiology , bacterial interactions of virus and bacteria may play some role .	1
22258	Nurse ( N3 ) said : " Sometimes we are supplied with fake N95 masks or required to use surgical masks	1
22259	We only get 21 masks per week , to share with social workers , doctors and other staff that come to the @DISEASE$ wards	1
22260	We do not get enough gloves , and we do not have aprons	1
22261	We sometimes lack soap to wash our hands after coming into contact with @DISEASE$ patients , and we also have limited washing basins	1
22262	In addition , the windows are too small and there is poor airflow in the wards	1
22263	UV lights are not regularly service	1
22264	" Nurse ( N1 ) added that : " This whole thing ( emotional ) of us being given fake masks results in negative practice for patient - care since we are afraid to contract @DISEASE$	1
22265	Each time we look at the patients we get scared of being in the same situation , hmmm , there are more negative thoughts in @DISEASE$ wards than positive ones	1
22266	"	1
22267	Six major themes emerged after extensive data organization and analysis	1
22268	These themes were developed from the comments that were made by the participants during data collection	1
22269	A discussion of findings follows the presentation of each theme , as it is asserted that integrating the findings and the discussion is an appropriate method for encapsulating the essence of the phenomenon under investigation	1
22270	Existing literature was searched and used to support the findings of this study .	1
22271	@DISEASE$ and risk of @DISEASE$ : results of an infection - diary based cohort study	1
22272	@GENE$ have been commonly used in the diagnosis of various diseases	1
22273	Therapeutics based on @GENE$ have been used successfully in the therapy of various diseases [ 70 , 71 ]	1
22274	The potential of this approach was acknowledged against coronaviruses during the @DISEASE$ outbreak [ 72 , 73 ]	1
22275	And when the other deadly coronavirus attacked humans , this previous knowledge helped greatly in the improving the response against the risk of @DISEASE$ .	1
22276	An analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H	1
22277	littoralis	1
22278	The method was found to be accurate and repeatable and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples	1
22279	The highest lycorine content in the wild plants was found in the bulb extract , whereas the least was in the root extract	1
22280	Callus culture samples of H	1
22281	littoralis had comparable lycorine content to that of wild plants	1
22282	The results showed that 4	1
22283	5 M 2 , 4 - D alone or a combination of 9	1
22284	00 M with 4	1
22285	5 M BAP was the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine content in callus culture .	1
22286	Clinical cure was generally obtained in the few cats that were treated with meglumine antimoniate , but long term follow up are not available from these cases .	1
22287	It is noteworthy that three cats which were never treated with anti - Leishmania drugs after diagnosis died or were euthanized 1 - 5 years later and one was reported alive after 4 years	1
22288	In these untreated cases , @DISEASE$ progressed with time and @DISEASE$ developed in two cats that were not treated	1
22289	Untreated ocular @DISEASE$ may cause @DISEASE$ and may require ocular enucleation due to @DISEASE$ [ 50 , 53 , 55 , 68 , 69 ] .	1
22290	In order to observe the effects of the cell cycle on virus growth , subconfluent cultures of @DISEASE$ cells were synchronized in G0 / G1 phase by serum deprivation for 24 h ( He et al	1
22291	, 2010 )	1
22292	For S - phase synchronization , a final concentration of 0	1
22293	85 mM thymidine ( Sigma ) were added ( Helt and Harris , 2005 ; Yu et al	1
22294	, 2015 ) for 24 h	1
22295	For G2 / M synchronization , 25 ng / ml of nocodazole ( Sigma ) was added ( He et al	1
22296	, 1995 ; Yu et al	1
22297	, 2015 ) for 24 h	1
22298	For sustained S and G2 / M cell - cycle arrest after virus infection , cells were treated with fresh 0	1
22299	85 mM thymidine and 25 ng / ml nocodazole for the indicated times .	1
22300	The first case of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) was identified in the year 2012 , which spread rapidly and increased to more than 2200 in 2018	1
22301	This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns	1
22302	Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of @DISEASE$ cases , and currently , no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment	1
22303	A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus , its structure , route of transmission and its pathophysiology	1
22304	Therefore , this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS - CoV ' s pathogenesis , treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments , and the major steps taken for @DISEASE$ prevention control	1
22305	Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses , and while most of these infect animals , particularly bats , a minor number can also cause human diseases [ 16 ]	1
22306	Human coronaviruses can be broadly divided into types , α and β coronavirus [ 17 ]	1
22307	MERS - CoV is from the β - coronavirus family [ 18 ]	1
22308	It has four major surface proteins that help the v@GENE$  cells viz	1

22313	N proteins and S , E and M prote@GENE$ t to@GENE$ orm comp@GENE$ particles [ 23 ]	1
22314	In addition to these structural proteins , MERS - CoV@GENE$ roteins called pp1a and pp1@GENE$ oteins @GENE$ roke@GENE$  by proteases to form various nonstr@GENE$ sential proteins@GENE$ Recent stu@GENE$ e revealed that these viral structural and nonstructur@GENE$ e exploited as novel targets for therapeutic purposes [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] .	1
22315	We used western blots to confirm that each @GENE$ otein was expressed in cell lines	1
22316	Each of seven proteins @GENE$  c@GENE$  ,@GENE$  ,@GENE$  -@GENE$  N@GENE$  NS5A @GENE$  NS5B - was recognized and labeled by a separate cognate antibody directed ( F@GENE$ re S3 )	1
22317	To induce effective immune responses ag@GENE$ teins in transgenic mice , we injected an rVV - @GENE$ - @GENE$ - CN5@GENE$ - N25 ) or LC16m8 ( as the control ) intradermally into CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 90 days after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 2B )	1
22318	Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization@GENE$ - N25 revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with @DISEASE$ - including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , @DISEASE$ , and @DISEASE$ ( Figures 2C - E )	1
22319	Collectively , these results demonstrated that only the rVV - N25 treatment resulted in histological @GENE$ dicative of improvement in the @DISEASE$ suffered by the transgenic mice .	1
22320	The @GENE$ and @GENE$ are associated with cardiac phenotypes overlapping those of the stressed heart A limitation to single trait / transcript analysis is that it does not allow for combinatorial interactions with additional genetic loci , because each trait is individually regressed against every marker , i	1
22321	e	1
22322	, only one locus is considered per trait ( Michaelson et al	1
22323	2009 )	1
22324	Therefore , all n 24 @GENE$ were merged into a single trait using PCA	1
22325	A network of 100 probes that correlated ( r	1
22326	0	1
22327	553 , P , 2	1
22328	40e 205 ) with the synthetic PCA trait was identified .	1
22329	Two @GENE$ , two essential @GENE$ and two @GENE$ interact to form the thick filament of the sarcomere ( Reiser et al	1
22330	2001 ; Yamashita et al	1
22331	2003 )	1
22332	At the level of the infundibulum , the virus attached abundantly and with high specificity to the cilia of the epithelial cells lining the fimbriae ( Figure 6 )	1
22333	In the magnum , virus binding occurred at the level of the ciliated epithelium , and although positivity was highly specific , staining intensity was lower than the one recorded in the infundibulum	1
22334	The isthmus showed no attachment of the virus to the epithelial cells while staining localized to granules within secretory glands in the lamina propria	1
22335	The uterus showed a highly specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells .	1
22336	We hence hypothesize that the virus might have spread to the oviduct either systemically or via alternative routes , either by ascending the cloaca , or by contact with the infected abdominal air sacs and ovary	1
22337	The latter case would be in keeping with the replication of the virus in the mesothelial cells of the oviduct serosa and the strong binding of the labelled virus to these cells	1
22338	Unfortunately , Figure 6 Virus - histochemistry of the oviduct	1
22339	Red staining indicates the binding of the FITC - labelled virus to the tissues	1
22340	Sections are counterstained with hematoxylin	1
22341	A The infundibulum showed a highly specific and uniform positivity of the cilia at the level of the epithelium lining the @GENE$	1
22342	B In the magnum , we observed a specific staining of the ciliated epithelium but intensity was lower compared with the infundibulum	1
22343	C No attachment of the virus was observed at the level of the isthmus epithelium	1
22344	D The uterus showed a scattered but specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells .	1
22345	These studies indicate that waning antibody levels and suppression of innate immune response due to stress might be some of the factors leading to an increase in viral levels in persistently infected bats ( Figure 2 ) .	1
22346	The Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server also enables users to run various FBA studies on any of the genome - scale metabolic models stored in the SEED database	1
22347	These studies can be performed while simulating any of 525 distinct media conditions currently encoded in the SEED database ( which includes all BiologH [ 30 ] media conditions and a variety of complex media formulations )	1
22348	Both the Perl program and the API enable users to obtain a list of the media conditions currently stored in the SEED and details on the compounds included in each formulation	1
22349	Once a model and media condition have been selected for simulation , the server provides an interface for running three types of FBA simulation : ( i ) simple growth simulation to predict maximum growth rate of the organism in the selected media , ( ii ) flux variability analysis ( FVA ) [ 31 ] to classify the reactions and compounds in the model according to their behavior during growth in the selected media , and ( iii ) single gene knockout analysis to predict the genes essential for growth in the selected media .	1
22350	Mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting a large number of human and livestock viruses , like @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
22351	Infection of female mosquitoes with these viruses during blood feeding elicits an immune response	1
22352	It is not known how the viruses manage to replicate in spite of this antiviral response	1
22353	We used an unbiased transcriptome sequencing approach to identify genes differentia@GENE$ gulated after @DISEASE$ infection resulting in 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways	1
22354	Ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , responsible for protein degradation , was found to be important during viral infection in mosquito cells	1
22355	Using in vitro and in vivo infection models , we identified Culex Cul4 @GENE$ g as pro - viral@GENE$ g viral titers	1
22356	Knockdown of Cul4 in Cul@GENE$ squitoes decreased viral titers in mosquito saliva	1

22361	The @GENE$ servers can have limitless applications	1
22362	Below , we demonstrate various applications of @GENE$ through a small set of potential applications and coding examples .	1
22363	Commonly used examples of the filter { a l } include the differencing , moving average , or @GENE$	1
22364	For a fixed value of α , let 1 - α denote the specificity ( the probability of no detection , when there is no actual outbreak signature )	1
22365	We declare evidence of an outbreak signature at time t if the detection process at that time point , D k , t , exceeds a threshold τ k , α , calculated using the data or the process	1
22366	Further details are given in the Appendix	1
22367	Filter plots Figure 2 Filter plots	1

22371	When { a l } is the @GENE$ , { @GENE$ } is a weighted average of the last 7 days ( with most weight on the current day ) , minus a weighted decaying average of the remaining past days	1
22372	The weekly seasonal terms are not as strong , compared to the filter that is the convolution of the @GENE$ .	1
22373	In the simulations described in this section we used the following experimental design	1
22374	For each city , we fit the	1
22375	The mechanism leading to the @GENE$ reactivation in our patient with @DISEASE$ is not known	1
22376	One possible mechanism is the reactivation and multiplication of live but dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG bacilli that may have been present at the inoculation site , facilitated by immune suppression induced by @DISEASE$	1
22377	In one previous case report , a severely @DISEASE$ 2	1
22378	5year old boy developed @DISEASE$ and possible disseminated @DISEASE$ 2 weeks after @DISEASE$ [ 20 ]	1
22379	Acid - fast bacilli was detected from a swab of the @DISEASE$	1
22380	This mechanism is , however , unlikely in our patient in view of the rapid onset and resolution of the @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$ with the appearance a@GENE$ esolution of the @DISEASE$	1
22381	Immune suppression induced by @DISEASE$ would normally be expected to persist for a longer duration [ 21 ]	1
22382	In addition , the lack of @DISEASE$ in the patient , the otherwise uncomplicated @DISEASE$ course , and the absence of secondary infections normally seen in severe @DISEASE$ states further renders this mechanism unlikely	1
22383	Another possible mechanism for the BCG reactivation , which appears more probable , is an immune@GENE$ ediated reaction	1
22384	Cross - reactivity between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins ( HSP ) , in part@GENE$ terial HSP 65 and human homologu@GENE$ P 63 , have been p@GENE$ e of BCG reactivatio@GENE$ ildren with @DISEASE$ [ 22 , 23 ]	1
22385	HSP@GENE$  ubiquitous molecules present in all organisms , including hu@GENE$  , and mediate important functions in protein folding , assembly and transport essential for cell survival [ 24 ]	1
22386	Synthesis of HSP are increased during conditions of cellular stress , including i@GENE$ tion , @DISEASE$ and other physical stresses	1
22387	In humans , increased production and serum concentrations of HSP , especially HSP 70 , have been reported during @DISEASE$ , incl@GENE$ g @DISEASE$ [@GENE$ 6 ]	1
22388	As homology between HSP 70 and mycobacterial antigens have been demonstrated [ 27 ] , a simil@GENE$ s - @GENE$ o occur in children with @DISEASE$ could possibly also explain the BCG reactivation in our patient	1
22389	These mechanisms are especially intriguing as @GENE$ EASE$ typically cause @DISEASE$ and anergy to tuberculin [ 9 ] .	1
22390	This study was conducted at a regional hospital in Vhembe district in Limpopo Province , South Africa between 2014 and 2015	1
22391	The hospital is a public healthcare facility situated in Thohoyandou , Limpopo province of South Africa	1
22392	It is the only regional hospital in Vhembe district of Limpopo province with two @DISEASE$ wards and 20 beds	1
22393	It is a referral hospital for seven community hospitals in Vhembe district	1
22394	According to Wolmarans and Asia [ 11 ] , the total population is about 1 , 294 , 722 , comprising of Vha - venda , Va - tsonga , and Sotho speaking people .	1
22395	Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went extinct in 1957 , but was reintroduced in 1976 , apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s	1
22396	The resulting " frozen " lineage appeared less mutated compared to all other contemporary H1N1 strains ( i	1
22397	e	1
22398	, porcine strains and a few rare H1N1 strains appearing in humans but not derived from the frozen strain )	1
22399	Consistent with the genetic attenuation model , the frozen human H1N1 lineage disappeared in 2009 , and may now be extinct .	1
22400	Inspired by this work , we decided to study the acute and chronic impact of a G1 - lineage H9N2 virus on the performance of Hy - Line Brown hens at the peak of lay , to fully elucidate the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease in commercial layers .	1
22401	To further analyze the molecular mechanism and consequences through which @GENE$ exerts its inhibitory effect , we first investigated what @GENE$ might interact with the @GENE$	1
22402	Several @GENE$ were ectopically expressed with @GENE$ in cultured cells for a coimmunoprecipitation experiment	1
22403	When the @GENE$ were precipitated with an @GENE$ , the @GENE$ was only detected in @GENE$ - containing precipitate ( Figure 4A ; lane 4 compared with lanes 1 - 3 ) even though @GENE$ was abundantly expressed in all samples with other @GENE$ ( Figure 4A ; lower panel for input ) , @GENE$ functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer @GENE$ with the @GENE$ containing @GENE$ and @GENE$ that are essential for @GENE$ activation	1
22404	34 , 53 The physical association of the @GENE$ with @GENE$ ( Figure 4A ) prompted us to test whether the adapter function of @GENE$ would be particularly affected by @GENE$	1
22405	We performed another co - immunoprecipitation experiment to explore the possibility that @GENE$ could perturb the interaction of @GENE$ with the @GENE$	1
22406	When @GENE$ and @GENE$ were ectopically expressed in cultured cells , the detection of @GENE$ in @GENE$ - immunoprecipitate confirmed the specific recruitment of @GENE$ to @GENE$ in the absence of @GENE$ ( Figure 4B ; lane 2 compared with lane 1 )	1
22407	However , when @GENE$ was added to the system , the interaction between @GENE$ and @GENE$ was significantly disrupted ( Figure 4B ; lane 3 compared with lane 2 ) , demonstrating that the physical association of @GENE$ with @GENE$ perturbs TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction .	1

22422	Stock titers for all viruses were determined using BHK21 cells for viral plaque assay as previously described [ 46 ] .	1
22423	The detection of the @GENE$ was used as a token of DWV replication [ 48 , 49 ]	1
22424	First , the @GENE$ was tagged and then amplified : The @GENE$ of all T1 and T2 colonies sampled at Week 13 and 16 were obtained by using @GENE$ ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) following the manufacturer ' s recommendations ( 1 µL of @GENE$ , Table 1 , 1 µL dNTP 10 mM , 4 µL of 5 × first strand buffer , 2 µL 0	1
22425	1 M DTT , 1 µL @GENE$ , H 2 O and sample in a final reaction volume of 20 µL ) [ 52 ]	1
22426	The reaction was processed in a thermocycler ( Biometra ; Analytik Jena , Jena , Germany ) according to the following protocol : 5 min at 65 • C , 10 min at 25 • C , 60 min at 50 • C followed by 15 min at 70 • C	1
22427	The obtained @GENE$ then was purified using the @GENE$ ® Gel & PCR Clean - up kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) and eluted in 30 µL elution buffer to avoid false - positive results	1
22428	A five - fold dilution of the purified @GENE$ was used for the subsequent amplification with conventional PCR ( @GENE$ [UNK] kit by Bioline , London , UK )	1
22429	@GENE$ was used as the @GENE$ , while a Tag oligonucleotide ( Table 1 ) was used as @GENE$	1
22430	For each sample , a second reaction was carried out without @GENE$ to check for efficient removal of @GENE$ after the reverse transcription	1
22431	The thermal cycling was done with a profile that consisted of 2 min incubation at 95 • C and 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 • C for denaturation , 20 s at 42 • C for annealing , and 30 s at 72 • C for extension	1
22432	By electrophoresis on a 1	1
22433	5 % agarose gel , the @GENE$ were analyzed and visually checked under UV light	1
22434	If a clear band was present at @GENE$ and the associated negative control was indeed negative , a sample was considered positive .	1
22435	We have found that denaturation of template was a prerequisite step prior to amplification , unlike results found by Nagamine and co - workers [ 14 ]	1
22436	This can be explained by the fact that we do not use a base pair destabiliser , such as betaine , in the reaction buffer	1
22437	Since we are detecting down to near single copies of templates , our results suggest no benefit to the sensitivity of the assay by their inclusion	1
22438	The consistent amplification within all dilutions showed that @GENE$ is an ' all or nothing ' reaction , with little of the tailing off effect that is often observed in @GENE$ with diluting templates	1
22439	This makes it easy to identify positive reactions	1
22440	Together with specificity and the speed at which reactions can be performed , @GENE$ is an excellent method for diagnostics [ 8 , 10 , 15 ] .	1
22441	Genetic recombination is generally considered to be a key mechanism underlying the generation and evolution of parvoviruses	1
22442	Coinfection with multiple @DISEASE$ strains has occurred , potentially facilitating recombination and leading to high genetic heterogeneity	1
22443	8 Recently , a Japanese research group provided clear evidence of recombination between CPV and FPLV under field conditions	1
22444	9 Interestingly , an analysis of the H@GENE$ equence with the recombination detection programs RDP3 and GARD suggested that the HN - ZZ1 strain is a novel recombinant virus between CPV and FPLV	1
22445	The RDP3 program identified n@GENE$ s an ending breakpoint , and a predicted recombination region was located around p@GENE$ f the alignment	1
22446	Among the nucleotide sequence data for all 25 strains entered the RDP3 program , this part possessed the greatest similarity ( 99	1
22447	3 % ) to the corresponding part of CPV - 2b strain CPV - 447 isolated from Germany ( Supplementary Figure S4 )	1
22448	The GARD program identified n@GENE$ s a putative breakpoint for recombination	1
22449	The alignment was cut at this point , and separate phylogenies for each section of H@GENE$ ere constructed	1
22450	The first half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing CPV , while the latter half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing FPLV	1
22451	In addition to the HN - ZZ1 strain isolated in the tigers , there is strong evidence supporting recombination events in the genomic sequences of MEV _ LN - 10 previously isolated from mink , and XJ - 1 and HRB - CS1 previously isolated from cats in China	1
22452	[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Phylogenetic analysis of the V@GENE$ f the HN - ZZ1 strain and 21 reference strains showed that the V@GENE$ f HN - ZZ1 aligned with the FPLV branch originating in Felidae and clustered in the FPLV branch	1
22453	This study also indicated that the V@GENE$ f HN - ZZ1 showed a relatively distant relationship from those of the Purevax and Felocell vaccine strains	1
22454	We speculated that the differences in the V@GENE$ etween the wild type and vaccine strains may be one of the factors underlying the failure of vaccination against FPLV	1
22455	13 Interestingly , the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 gene was more closely related to the CPV branch originating in dogs and clustered with virus strains in the CPV branch ( Figure 1A )	1
22456	We analyzed host - specific sites of key amino acids in the VP2 protein of the HN - ZZ1 strain and found that the amino acids at positions 80 , 93 , 103 , 300 , 305 , 323 , 564 and 568 of VP2 were identical to those of FPLV reference strains	1
22457	However , the NS1 protein of the HN - ZZ1 strain had amino - acid characteristics of CPV , with the exception of the amino acid at position 248 ( Figure 1B )	1
22458	6 An analysis using other evolutionary models , such as the Jukes - Cantor method , produced trees with nearly identical topologies ( data not shown ) .	1
22459	Influenza phylogenies are odd , in some respects , consisting of one main trunk with many short and short - lived side branches [ 36 , 39 , 42 , 43 ]	1
22460	There are several factors that influence strain diversity , including the mutation rate , selection , drift , and crossimmunity - mediated competition between strains [ 39 ]	1
22461	Feguson , et al	1
22462	[ 39 ] felt that strain - transcending immunity was essential in restricting viral diversity	1
22463	Ito , et al	1
22464	[ 42 ] thought that the many side branches died out because they could not compete with the main - trunk lineage viruses	1
22465	Others have noted the temporal extinction of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes [ 5 ]	1
22466	Whatever the reason , a hierarchy of strain robustness is evident in the history of @DISEASE$ .	1
22467	Limited research effort has implications for assessing the conservation status of bat species in Western Asia and impedes our ability to identify imperiled species	1
22468	A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern ( 77 % ) , and 9 % of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status ( Figure 4a )	1
22469	Yet , population trends for most bat species in Western Asia , including those classified as " least concern , " are largely unknown or decreasing ( Figure 4b ) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation	1
22470	Table S2 for species in each category ) .	1
22471	Recent outbreaks of CoVs in humans and domestic animals elevates the viral family Coronaviridae to be of great concern as a likely source of new emerging @DISEASE$ , and a priority for future viral surveillance efforts	1
22472	Based on our current understanding of CoV systematics , all human CoVs have evolutionary origins in wildlife reservoirs , with SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV , and human - CoVs NL63 and 229E considered to have originated in bats [ 39 , 124 , 125 ]	1
22473	Moreover , spillover of bat - associated CoVs has occurred into domestic animals , for example SADS - CoV has a 90 % mortality rate in young piglets [ 33 , 124 ]	1
22474	On a global scale , reported CoV diversity mirrored species richness , suggesting regions with greater species richness will also have higher CoV diversity [ 9 ]	1
22475	We found that research effort on bat - associated CoVs was significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis ( r = 0	1
22476	26 , p = 0	1
22477	001 ) ( Table S3 )	1
22478	However , research effort was greatly skewed towards the United States and China ( Figure 6 ) , with 71 % of all other countries reporting no published research on bat - associated CoVs ( Table S4 )	1
22479	Not surprising , China published the most studies on bat - associated CoVs , which is largely driven by targeted efforts to identify and characterize SARS - related CoVs in bats following the @DISEASE$ outbreak that originated in the wet markets of Guangdong Province in late 2002 and later spread to another 28 countries , including the United States , by mid - 2003 [ 39 , 85 ]	1

22481	" Vets were not familiar to treat fish , so farmers didn ' t trust the vets to treat their fish , and vets then became very unwilling to treat farm fish	1

22485	With anthropogenic releases of carbon emissions contributing toward @DISEASE$ primarily characterized by global warming , many policymakers and scientific - researchers are seeking scales	1
22486	Therefore , comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city - level carbon emissions accounting , as well as local emission mitigation strategies [ 28 ]	1
22487	The second strand of research focuses on the city - level driving factors and influencing mechanisms	1
22488	Decomposition analysis ( e	1

22492	Stochastic impacts by regression on population , affluence , and technology ( STIRPAT ) model ) are the most commonly applied methods for the scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis of factors influencing city - level carbon emissions , especially the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index ( LMDI ) method based on the IDA framework	1
22493	As shown in Table 1 , the SDA method based on the IO technique applied in the city - level driving factors and influencing mechanisms research in China were mainly focused on the four municipalities ( i	1

22496	Finally , differences in dietary fiber and prebiotic ingredients may have influenced response	1
22497	Crude fiber analysis was 2	1
22498	22 % in Diet A and 3	1
22499	16 % in Diet B	1
22500	Total dietary fiber and the soluble and insoluble fractions were not analyzed in this study	1
22501	These data would have helped to better characterize the dietary fiber composition of the diets ; however , ingredient composition provides some insight as to how these two diets differ	1
22502	Diet A utilized dried beet pulp , fructooligosaccharides , and mannanoligosaccharides , while Diet B utilized powdered cellulose followed by dried beet pulp	1
22503	Based on the ingredient composition , Diet A would be expected to provide more fermentable fibers and prebiotics that may have promoted an increased production of total intraluminal short - chain fatty acids and positively influenced microbial populations ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) ( 27 ) ( 28 ) ( 29 ) ( 30 )	1
22504	While dietary fiber and prebiotics are generally considered to provide benefits primarily within the large intestine and aid in the management of @DISEASE$ , recent studies have demonstrated immune modulating benefits that could have broader benefits , particularly in conditions with an inflammatory nature ( 31 , 32 )	1
22505	The time required to see potential clinical benefits is unclear , and clinical improvement related to immunomodulation may require more than 1 - 2 weeks of dietary intervention	1
22506	Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of the microbiota in @DISEASE$ and the potential benefits of dietary fibers and prebiotics in animals with @DISEASE$ .	1
22507	So far , conjugation of CPPs to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers ( PMOs ) has clearly been the most popular and most promising use of CPPs in antiviral development	1
22508	PMOs are antisense DNA oligonucleotide analogues [ 54 ]	1
22509	Their backbone is composed of morpholine rings joined by uncharged phosphodiamidate linkages , in place of the sugar and anionic phosphodiester linkage of DNA	1
22510	They are typically synthesized as 20 - 25 - base long oligomers	1
22511	They offer great features for clinical applications : they are water - soluble , nuclease - resistant , and their uncharged backbone interacts weakly with serum and @GENE$ thereby reducing toxicity [ 55 ]	1
22512	PMOs are mainly designed to interact with @GENE$ of the target mRNA , @GENE$ or @GENE$	1
22513	They As PMOs do not efficiently enter cells on their own , investigators have been routinely arming them with CPPs to promote their uptake into virus - infected cells and enhance their antisense efficacy [ 56 , 57 ]	1
22514	These peptide - conjugated PMOs are referred to as PPMOs in the literature	1
22515	As highlighted by Moulton and Jiang [ 58 ] , PMOs are particularly well - suited cargoes for @GENE$ as their uncharged components do not interact with the positively - charged carrier peptide thereby not interfering with its membrane binding properties	1
22516	The first report of PPMO antiviral activity in 2004 [ 59 ] has fueled the increasing interest in PMO - technology to inhibit @DISEASE$ infections as witnessed by more than 20 in vit ro and / or in vi vo studies published on antiviral PPMOs within the last five years ( Table 1 )	1
22517	Studies on RNA viruses have been extensively reviewed by Stein [ 60 ] with the latest in vivo work discussed by Moulton and Jiang [ 58 ]	1
22518	We will focus here on the overall findings in regards to the cell penetrating moiety of the conjugates , and we will then review the studies on targeting DNA viruses .	1
22519	Briefly , 96 - well ELISpot plates ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) were coated with @GENE$ ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) and incubated overnight at 4 ° C	1
22520	The following day , the plates were washed with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBST + 1 % BSA	1
22521	Two hundred thousand splenocytes from immunised mice were added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 in the presence of media alone ( negative control ) , media with PMA / ionomycin ( positive control ) or media with peptide pools ( 1 μg / ml ) consisting of 15 - mers overlapping by nine amino acids and spanning the length of the @GENE$ ( Genscript , Piscataway , NJ , USA )	1
22522	After 24 h , the cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4 ° C with @GENE$ ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA )	1
22523	@GENE$ ( R & D Systems ) was added to each well after washing and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature	1
22524	The plate was washed , and then 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 ′ indolylphosphate p - toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride ( chromogen colour reagent ; R & D Systems ) was added	1
22525	Last , the plates were rinsed with distilled water , dried at room temperature and SFU were quantified by an automated ELISpot reader ( CTL Limited , Shaker Heights , OH , USA ) , and the raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes	1
22526	For RM samples , the @GENE$ for monkey IFN - γ kit ( MABTECH , Cincinnati , OH , USA ) was used as described by the manufacturer ; two hundred thousand PBMCs were stimulated with peptide pools ; and the plates were washed and spots were developed and counted as described before	1
22527	25 Humoral immune response : antibody - binding ELISA An ELISA was used to determine the titres of mouse and R sera as previously described	1
22528	25 Briefly , 1 μg of purified rZIKV - E protein was used to coat 96 - well microtiter plates ( Nalgene Nunc International , Naperville , IL , USA ) at 4 ° C overnight	1
22529	After blocking with 10 % FBS in PBS for at least an hour , the plates were washed four times with 0	1
22530	05 % PBST ( Tween20 in PBS )	1
22531	Serum samples from immunised mice and RMs were serially diluted in 1 % FBS , added to the plates , then incubated for 1 h at room temperature	1
22532	The plates were again washed four times in 0	1
22533	05 % PBST , then incubated with HRP - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( Sigma ) at a 1 : 35 , 000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature	1
22534	For RM sera , anti - monkey IgG HRP ( Southern Biotech , Birmingham , AL , USA ) was used at a 1 : 5 , 000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature	1
22535	The bound enzyme was detected by adding SIGMAFAST OPD ( o - phenylenediamine dihydrochloride ) substrate solution according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Sigma - Aldrich , St	1
22536	Louis , MO , USA )	1
22537	The reaction was stopped after 15 min with the addition of 1 N H 2 SO 4	1
22538	The optical density at 450 nm was read on a Synergy plate reader	1
22539	All the mouse and RM serum samples were assayed in duplicate	1
22540	Endpoint titres were determined using the method described by Frey et al	1
22541	27 Neutralisation ( PRNT 50 ) assay	1
22542	The @GENE$ encodes full - length precursor of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) plus @GENE$ ) and a construct encoding a @GENE$ were synthesised	1
22543	A consensus strategy was used and the @GENE$ were determined by the alignment of current @GENE$	1
22544	The @GENE$ was genetically optimised ( i	1
22545	e	1
22546	, codon and RNA optimisation ) for enhanced expression in humans and an @GENE$ was added to facilitate expression	1
22547	The construct was synthesised commercially ( Genscript , NJ , USA ) , and then subcloned into a @GENE$ under the control of the @GENE$ as described before	1
22548	25 The final construct is named @GENE$ and the @GENE$ is @GENE$	1
22549	In addition , a number of other @GENE$ encoding the @GENE$ from MR766 ( DQ859059	1
22550	1 ) and a 2016 Brazilian ( AMA12084	1
22551	1 ) outbreak strain were also designed , for further evaluation	1
22552	Large - scale amplifications of @GENE$ were carried out by Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc	1
22553	( Plymouth Meeting , PA , USA ) and @GENE$ was formulated in water for immunisations	1
22554	The size of the @GENE$ was confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis	1
22555	Phylogenetic analysis was performed by multiple alignment with ClustalW using MEGA version 5 software	1
22556	25 DNA immunisations and electroporation - mediated delivery enhancement Female C57BL / 6 mice ( 6 - 8 weeks old ) and @GENE$ − / − mice ( 5 - 6 weeks old ) were immunised with 25 μg of DNA in a total volume of 20 or 30 μl of water delivered into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo electroporation delivery	1
22557	In vivo electroporation was delivered with the @GENE$ adaptive constant current electroporation device ( Inovio Pharmaceuticals ) at the same site immediately following DNA injection	1
22558	A three - pronged CELLECTRA minimally invasive device was inserted ~ 2 mm into the muscle	1
22559	Square - wave pulses were delivered through a triangular threeelectrod array consisting of 26 - gauge solid stainless steel electrodes and two constant current pulses of 0	1
22560	1 Amps were delivered for 52 msec / pulse separated by a 1 s delay	1
22561	Further protocols for the use of electroporation have been previously described in detail	1
22562	26 The mice were immunised three times at 2 - week intervals and killed 1 week after the final immunisation	1
22563	Blood and splenocytes were collected after each immunisation for the analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses	1
22564	25 Rhesus macaque immunogenicity studies : five rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally at two sites two times at 4 - week intervals with 2 mg ZIKV - prME vaccine	1
22565	Electroporation was delivered at 0	1
22566	2 Amps immediately using the same device described for mouse immunisations .	1
22567	The association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ outcomes was more prominent for women than for men and reached statistical significance only for the former ( Table 4 )	1
22568	For most outcomes this interaction was not significant , with the individual level diary score as an exception	1
22569	When looking at sports activity , for most outcomes the association with @DISEASE$ was confined to those physically more active and not seen for those reporting little sports activity ( Table 5 )	1
22570	For all outcomes the association was less pronounced in the latter group ( compare the ratios of ORs in Table 5 ) , a difference that reached significance for all outcomes except those with low prevalence	1
22571	Typically the prevalence of an outcome was only increased in the small group of people with @DISEASE$ and higher sports activity whereas all other groups presented rather similar patterns	1
22572	Similarly , the prevalence of outcomes was increased among people with @DISEASE$ and a more favourable nutritional pattern , but comparable among the other groups ( Table 6 )	1
22573	The interaction reaches significance for the majority of outcomes .	1
22574	These are stabilised via double - bond rearrangement ( electron deslocalization ) , originating conjugated dienes and trienes	1
22575	These intermediates decompose , originating alcohols , aldehydes , alkyl formates , ketones , hydrocarbons , alkoxyl radicals and formic acid	1
22576	All of these compounds are considered secondary products of lipid oxidation [ 5 ] .	1
22577	Three to five day - old female mosquitoes ( n = 40 ) were microinjected with dsRNA against @GENE$ or @GENE$ ( 200 ng / mosquito )	1
22578	Mosquitoes were blood - fed with WNV ( 1	1
22579	13 × 10 ^ 6 pfu / ml ) one day later and were maintained in a diurnal cycle ( 23 / 26 ° C ) in an environmental cabinet	1
22580	At 10 - 12 days post - infection , saliva was collected in capillary tubes containing 5 μl FCS for 10 min using a protocol described previously [ 61 ]	1
22581	Midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead - beater	1
22582	RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from the midgut and carcass of individual mosquitoes and was used for real - time RTqPCR as described above	1
22583	Saliva from each mosquito was diluted in 300 μl of L - 15 medium and was used to determine viral titer by plaque assay as described above .	1
22584	Thymus marschallianus Will	1

22586	oils from China had lower capacity for preventing lecithin peroxidation than BHT , using TBARS method	1
22587	Nevertheless , between the oils , that isolated from Thymus proximus had much higher activity	1
22588	p - Cymene , γ - terpinene and thymol predominated in this ois , whereas in the other oil , only γ - terpinene and thymol dominated	1
22589	According to these results , the authors [ 54 ] stressed the importance of p - cymene in the antioxidant activity of Thymus proximus , besides thymol and γ - terpinene .	1
22590	PBMCs were seeded immediately after isolation at a concentration of 3 × 10 6 cells / mL in 96 - well U - bottom plates	1
22591	Triplicate cultures for each cat were treated with either 4 μg / mL ODN 2216 or 2243 or an equal volume of endotoxin - free PBS	1
22592	After an initial incubation of 18 h , the cells were pulsed for 24 h with 3 H - thymidine ( Perkin Elmer , Schwerzenbach , Switzerland )	1
22593	Standard liquid scintillation protocols were used for harvesting of the cells and uptake of 3 H was assessed with the Packard Tri - Carb 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer ( Perkin Elmer )	1
22594	Proliferation rates were calculated as the mean counts per minute ( c	1

22597	The stimulation index ( SI ) depicted in Figure 1 was calculated as follows :	1
22598	The specimens were refrigerated at 2 to 8 ° C following collection at the field clinic and transported on ice every working day to the main laboratory in Kathmandu , where they were vortexed and divided into three equal aliquots in sterile vials ( CryoTubes [UNK] , Nunc AS , Roskilde , Denmark )	1
22599	The aliquots analyzed in Nepal were either frozen at - 70 ° C or kept at 2 to 8 ° C in the refrigerator before analysis	1
22600	A separate comparative study verified that there were no substantial differences in proportion detected between the two alternative storage temperatures for up to three months ( unpublished data )	1
22601	One aliquot was immediately frozen at - 70 ° C and transported to Norway on dry ice and again stored at - 70 ° C in case there should be a need for reanalysis .	1
22602	Our investigation into the substrate specificity of @GENE$ underscored the utility of the MSP - MS assay over conventional techniques for determining @GENE$ specificity	1
22603	A number of limitations exist when using single - amino acid chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates to determine @GENE$ specificity with @GENE$ ′ reporter groups , as an example , potentially altering the @GENE$ specificity profile	1
22604	In addition to reporting on prime - side specificity , our global approach also allowed for the identification of individual synthetic peptides that are bona fide substrates and served as a template for @GENE$ EASE$ inhibitor des@GENE$	1
22605	APN has emerged as impo@GENE$ arget in aggressive @DISEASE$	1
22606	We envision that the substrate specificity preferences identified here will both guide the development of next - ge@GENE$ tion @DISEASE$ - targeted therapeutics as well as aid in the discovery of its endogenous substrates to further expand our knowledge of its role in biology .	1
22607	Large number of indoor air pollutants has been associated with health responses , but some of those either play a small role from the point of view of public health , or pose challenges for the exposure assessment or quantification of the burden of disease .	1
22608	Similar results were obtained in the review by Seppänen et al	1
22609	( 2004 ) [ 7 ]	1
22610	They None of the studies included in the reviews specifically addressed the role of outdoor air quality on indoor exposures , even though 90 % of EU citizens live in areas where the WHO guidelines for air quality for PM 2	1
22611	5 is not met [ 10 ]	1
22612	Neither was the existence of indoor air sources systematically analysed nor exposure levels quantified or considered when associating ventilation and health	1
22613	Therefore the support from these previous studies on determining the best combination of source control and ventilation levels is limited	1
22614	This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements	1
22615	The methods presented here allow for informed health - based optimization of efforts aimed at reducing harmful exposures and improving health of the occupants	1
22616	The results are intended for development of national and international guidelines and standards , and can also be used as background information when	1
22617	Others : Several studies have documented a significant improvement of weight gain , and feed conversion , as well as the reduction of the incidence , severity and duration of @DISEASE$ in weaned pigs fed diets supplemented with substances such as :@GENE$  [ 147 ] , milk products [ 148 ] , clay minerals [ 149 ] , and medicinal plants [ 150 ]	1
22618	Although many peer - reviewed studies discussing these substances are available in the scientific literature , most of the clinical studies were performed in experimental conditions	1
22619	More research is needed to evaluate the potential effectiveness of these substances under field conditions for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs .	1
22620	Probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria , Bacillus and yeasts are live microbial feed supplements [ 122 ]	1
22621	Probiotic bacteria have also been shown to produce antimicrobial molecules , such as @GENE$ , and to inhibit the production of bacterial toxins or the adhesion of pathogens to the intestinal mucosa [ 123 ]	1
22622	Several studies demonstrated that pre - treatment with certain probiotics , such as L	1
22623	rhamnosus , was effective in reducing @DISEASE$ in experimental ETEC : @DISEASE$ in pigs , possibly via the modulation of the intestinal microbiota , enhancement of intestinal antibody defense , and regulation of production@GENE$ ine [ 128 ]	1
22624	Recently , Lane et al	1
22625	[ 129 ] reported that L	1

22627	2 % ) in the weaned pig diet resulted in higher Lactobacillus counts and lower E	1
22628	coli counts , as well as an increase in ADG and the average daily feed intake in supplemented pigs compared to the basal diet pigs	1
22629	A Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis spore mixture ( BLS - mix ) was effective in preventing loss of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity after a challenge with ETEC :	1
22630	Proteins involved in the stimulus - response and regulation of apoptosis were enriched by Gene Cluster 3	1

22632	As shown in Fig	1
22633	4a , hierarchical clustering of the @GENE$ was generated using the @GENE$ listed in Supplementary Table S1	1
22634	The analysis revealed that all replicates clustered tightly	1
22635	Interestingly , the DAVID software analysis showed that most proteins in a given cluster were enriched for functions involved in similar biological processes .	1
22636	The indication for @GENE$ ( IVIG ) treatment was determined at the discretion of the treating intensivist	1
22637	IVIG was applied if a @DISEASE$ or an infection due to multi - resistant gram - negative bacteria ( MRGN ) was suspected	1

22642	Conclusion : PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through increased @GENE$ gene expression that is dependent on @GENE$ and induction of @GENE$	1

22659	The final node sampling scheme considered is targeted node sampling ( TNS )	1
22660	In TNS , we sample specific nodes based on certain criteria	1
22661	In this case , we chose the weighted - degree of the node	1
22662	All nodes having a weighted - degree of at least x are sampled and their neighbours are captured ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1 )	1
22663	A graphical depiction of the three node sampling network schemes is shown in the electronic supplementary material , figure S2 .	1
22664	The @GENE$ is a group of @GENE$ expressed ubiquitously by both fetal and adults tissues	1
22665	Protein levels of @GENE$ have been documented in the brain , pancreas , lung , intestines , prostate , heart , endothelial cells and in components of the immune system 1 , 2	1
22666	Each @GENE$ demonstrates unique substrate specificity by preferring certain amino acids at the @GENE$ of their endogenous substrates	1
22667	For example , @GENE$ prefers basic amino acids , whereas @GENE$ prefers acidic amino acids 3	1
22668	The substrate specificities of the @GENE$ allow each of them to selectively catalyze the activation or metabolism of bioactive peptides	1
22669	The most studied member of the @GENE$ is @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , also known as @GENE$	1
22670	@GENE$ exists as a @GENE$ with a small @GENE$ , a @GENE$ , a small @GENE$ , and a large @GENE$ on the @GENE$	1
22671	Cleaving after neutral amino acids , as implied by the " N " in its name , @GENE$ degrades peptides that are involved in different physiological pathways , including @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ by inactivating enkephalin , as well as regulating blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin III 1 , 5	1

22673	The worldwide air transportation network is defined by a passenger flux matrix that quantifies the number of passengers traveling between each pair of airports	1
22674	We use a dataset provided by OAG ( Official Airline Guide ) Ltd	1
22675	( http : / / www	1

22677	com ) , containing 4 , 092 airports and the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights between pairs of airports during the years 2004 - 2006	1
22678	We take the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights from airport i to j to be proportional to the number of passengers traveling .	1
22679	Comparing accuracy of the minimum free energy structures with the maximum accuracy structures in this work , Table 6 Comparison of bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure between the minimum energy structures and the maximum accuracy structures of the HK - PK and the HK - PK - free data sets	1
22680	@DISEASE$ patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air by coughing , sneezing , laughing , or singing	1
22681	These particles are called air droplet nuclei	1
22682	They are invisible to the naked eye	1
22683	Droplet nuclei can remain airborne in room air for many hours , until they are removed by natural or mechanical ventilation	1
22684	For @DISEASE$ to spread , there must be a person with @DISEASE$ who produces the @DISEASE$ bacilli , and another person who inhales the droplet nuclei containing the bacilli	1
22685	Although @DISEASE$ is not usually spread by brief contact , anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected .	1
22686	According to the findings of the present study delays in diagnosis were due to the following factors : fear of stigma , patients ' dissatisfaction with service from private healthcare providers , lack of knowledge , patients ' beliefs , and patients choosing to consult traditional healers rather than healthcare facilities	1
22687	The findings of this study concur with the study conducted by Mbuthia et al	1
22688	[ 18 ] , many people in Africa visit traditional healers prior or concurrently with formal healthcare services	1
22689	Delays in @DISEASE$ diagnosis is common in many regions worldwide , due to patient related factors , such as stigma , lack of information , dissatisfaction with @DISEASE$ service , inaccessibility of treatment , or provider - related factors such as diagnosis delay , knowledge and skills of healthcare workers , and inadequate infrastructure .	1
22690	The presence of DMVs in coronavirus infected cells suggested that this group of viruses might , like other positive sense RNA viruses , utilise the autophagy pathway to generate the membrane structures required for replication	1
22691	Initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy [ 50 ]	1
22692	@GENE$ co - localised with @GENE$ throughout infection and the @GENE$ co - localised with @GENE$ early in infection , but this decreased over time	1
22693	In addition , MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5 − / − embryonic stem cell lines but virus titre was rescued in the presence of an @GENE$ [ 50 ]	1
22694	Further work using SARS - CoV again showed co - localisation between @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 51 ]	1
22695	However , work by others using bone marrow derived macrophages lacking ATG5 or ATG5 − / − primary murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , showed that MHV replication does not require either an intact autophagy pathway or conversion of @GENE$ to @GENE$	1
22696	They did however confirm that SARS - CoV @GENE$ co - localised with @GENE$ [ 52 ]	1
22697	Recently , Schneider et al	1
22698	demonstrated that SARS - CoV replication could also occur in ATG5 − / − MEFs , indicating no requirement for a complete autophagy pathway [ 53 ]	1
22699	Interestingly , it was observed that virus replication was unaffected by the induction of autophagy in wild type MEFs [ 53 ]	1
22700	Finally , de Haan et al	1
22701	were unable to show co - localisation between @GENE$ and @GENE$ [ 54 ] , and Snijder et al	1
22702	were unable to show co - localisation between SARS - CoV @GENE$ and either @GENE$ or @GENE$ , @GENE$ or @GENE$ [ 9 ]	1
22703	Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during @DISEASE$ infection , all studies did indicate that LC@GENE$ came punctate upon coronavirus infection , suggesting an induction of autophagy [ 9 , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 54 ] .	1
22704	The mechanisms by which @DISEASE$ 1 ( HIV - 1 ) crosses mucosal surfaces to establish infection are unknown	1
22705	Acidic genital secretions of @DISEASE$ - infected women contain HIV - 1 likely coated by antibody	1
22706	We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env - specific IgG , i@GENE$ cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals , augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20 - fold compared with Env - specific IgG a@GENE$  - specific IgG a@GENE$ ced transcytosis was observed with clinical @DISEASE$ isolates , including transmitted / founder strains , and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor ( FcRn ) - knockdown epithelial cells	1

22710	To compare the performance of different migration rate models in predicting global pandemic spread , we simulate a stochastic meta - population susceptible - infected - recovered ( SIR ) model with n = 14 populations , matching the 14 air communities analyzed in the phylogeographic model	1
22711	The model tracks the number of susceptible ( S ) , infected ( I ) and recovered ( R ) individuals in each population each day of the simulation	1
22712	The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [ 31 ]	1
22713	Infection spreads through mass - action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters	1
22714	Population - specific host population size is equal to human population size ( Text S1 )	1
22715	Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1 : the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [ 31 ] and the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1	1
22716	3 [ 31 ]	1
22717	This results in a transmission rate b ~ 0 : 433	1
22718	Although estimates of R 0 for @DISEASE$ vary across studies , the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations	1
22719	Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j ~ P n i ~ 1 r ij bI i S j = N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within - population contacts and r jj ~ 1	1
22720	Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates , so that r ij ~ c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data	1
22721	Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations ( see below )	1
22722	This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model , despite their different scales	1
22723	Compartments are updated according to a t - leaping algorithm [ 32 ] with one - day intervals .	1
22724	Coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) is a positive - sense RNA virus , belonging to the Picornaviridae family	1
22725	@DISEASE$ commonly infects children , resulting in a self - limiting illness that can lead to the development of @DISEASE$	1
22726	Importantly , @DISEASE$ infection can lead to @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [ 1 , 2 ]	1
22727	Currently , no antivirals are available for treating or preventing @DISEASE$ ; thus , the identification of novel antiviral targets is crucial to controlling infection	1
22728	Viral proteases , includi@GENE$ roteases , p@GENE$ he replication of RNA viruses [ 3 ]	1
22729	Following virus entry , picornavirus RNA is direc@GENE$ a host ribosomes into a polyprotein , containing @GENE$ ral and nonstructu@GENE$ s	1

22734	Transcytosis offers an explanation for movement of virus across epithelial cells forming tight junctions , which might normally exclude pathogens from moving beyond the surface	1
22735	However , in vitro , only a very small amount of virus , usually less than 0	1
22736	3 % of a cell - free virus inoculum , finds its way through cells into the medium bathing basolateral surfaces ( [ 9 ] )	1
22737	Interactions between @GENE$ and several @GENE$ , including glycolipids , heparan sulfate proteoglycans and @GENE$ , have been proposed to play a role in transcytosis [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] .	1
22738	A likely candidate underlying the @GENE$ : 77	1
22739	5 6 1 Mb eQTL is the @GENE$ , encoding @GENE$ , a @GENE$ which acts as a @GENE$ attached to the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ , the @GENE$ , and the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ 2008 )	1
22740	@GENE$ regulates the passive stretch of cardiomyocytes via the @GENE$ of the protein which is comprised of sequential Ig , PEVK , and N2B domains ( @GENE$ 2008 )	1
22741	In the heart , alternative splicing of @GENE$ results in a shorter @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) and a longer @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
22742	These two isoforms are coexpressed at different ratios during development as a mechanism for fine - tuning the passive stiffness of the cardiomyocyte	1
22743	@GENE$ acts as a signaling hub from which direct and indirect interactions with @GENE$ can lead to diverse cellular responses , including changes in gene expression ( Linke 2008 ) .	1
22744	In all of the experiments , birds were monitored twice a day to record the manifestation of clinical signs .	1
22745	However , it is important to highlight that clinical illness and subclinical infection in cats are less frequently reported than in their canine counterparts	1
22746	In fact , the seroprevalence of @DISEASE$ in cats is lower than in dogs from the same locations [ 23 , [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and a lower PCR prevalence in cats than in dogs is also reported from similar geographical areas [ 29 ]	1
22747	Immune responses leading to natural feline resistance might account for the observed differences in the prevalence of infection in cats as compared to dogs	1
22748	Studies evaluating @DISEASE$ specific cellular immunity tests in cats could better estimate infection , but they are still lacking in cats [ 22 ] .	1
22749	Animals and treatments	1
22750	The experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University ( approval number : 29154 ) , and were carried out in accordance with the Regulations on Animal Experiments in Nagoya University	1
22751	Pregnant ICR ( CD - 1 ) mice ( 7 - 8 weeks ) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Kanagawa , Japan )	1
22752	All mice were allowed free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12 - h light / dark cycle ( lights on at 9 : 00 AM )	1
22753	The pregnant mice were assigned randomly to three groups of five dams each : Control group , LPS group , and HW + LPS group ( Fig	1
22754	6 ) , as in our previous report 12	1
22755	All pregnant mice , except for those in the Control group , received an intraperitoneal injection ( i	1
22756	p	1
22757	) of 75 μg of LPS dissolved in sterile saline on E17	1
22758	In the Control group , the pregnant mice were injected with an equal volume of sterile saline	1
22759	In the HW + LPS group , the pregnant mice were administered HW , beginning 24 h before LPS injection and continuing until parturition	1
22760	HW was aliquoted in glass drinking bottles to prevent H 2 degassing as well as air refilling	1
22761	Offspring growth evaluation and behavioral testing	1
22762	As shown in Fig	1
22763	6 , after birth , all offspring were housed with their mother until P19 , when they were weaned , as previously reported 76 , 77	1
22764	We only used male offspring in all of the experiments because of previously reported sex effects 43	1
22765	All animals were left undisturbed except for measuring body weights and weekly cage changes	1
22766	Body weight was recorded at P4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 13 , 16 , and 19	1
22767	The order of the behavioral tests was as follows : ( 1 ) Y - maze test at postnatal 3 weeks 78 ; and ( 2 ) three - chamber sociability and social novelty test 79 and PPI test at postnatal 4 weeks , according to previous reports ( Fig	1
22768	6 )	1
22769	All behavioral tests were conducted between 1 PM and 8 PM .	1
22770	The most compute - intensive parts of each workflow ( i	1
22771	e	1
22772	ProtDist in Figure 1 , ProtPars in Figure 2 , and ProtML in Figure 3 ) are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several instances of the respective programs	1
22773	Figures 4 and 5 show execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of processors and sequences	1
22774	In summary it can be seen that the system can achieve linear speedups .	1
22775	A dataset of @GENE$ was retrieved from ViPR in order to infer relationship between HMPV viruses from Kenya and Zambia and viral populations sampled globally	1
22776	The dataset included 138 sequence entries ( > 13 , 000 nt ) that included date ( year ) and location of sample Table S3 )	1

22780	@GENE$ - TREE was used to infer maximum likelihood ( ML ) trees of the complete genome and individual genes under general time - reversible ( GTR ) substitution model with gamma - distributed among - site rate heterogeneity	1
22781	A summary of the methodology outlined here is depicted in Fig	1
22782	5 .	1
22783	Publically available genome assemblies from human ( Homo sapiens ) , chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , orangutan ( Pongo abelii ) , whitecheeked gibbon ( Nomascus leucogenys ) , rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) , baboon ( Papio anubis ) and marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) were queried for @GENE$	1
22784	The @GENE$ is in a poorly assembled region of the @GENE$ and was therefore incomplete	1
22785	The @GENE$ is almost entirely deleted from the @GENE$ ; @GENE$ is still present but contains a stop codon	1
22786	We therefore used @GENE$ and @GENE$ sequences from the publically available gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) genome assembly to ensure that seven primate sequences were used in all analyses .	1
22787	The program starts by obtaining a list of all compounds and reactions in the SEED E	1
22788	coli model ( Seed83333	1
22789	1 ) using the ' ' get _ compound _ id _ list ' ' and ' ' get _ reaction _ id _ list ' ' functions , respectively	1
22790	The program then uses these lists to obtain detailed data on all the E	1
22791	coli compounds and reactions ( using the ' ' get _ compound _ - data ' ' and ' ' get _ reaction _ data ' ' functions , respectively )	1
22792	These data are stored in two tables : one for compounds and one for reactions	1
22793	Next the ' ' classify _ model _ entities ' ' function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E	1
22794	coli model	1
22795	In this particular FVA , the reactions and compounds in the E	1
22796	coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media ( called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model )	1
22797	At this point , the data returned by the ' ' classify _ model _ entities ' ' function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously	1
22798	In the next step , the code uses the ' ' simulate _ model _ growth ' ' function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E	1
22799	coli model , maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media ( called Carbon - D - Glucose in the Model SEED )	1
22800	The data returned by this function are also added to the @GENE$ compound tables	1
22801	In the final call to the server , the program uses the ' ' simulate _ all _ single _ gene _ knockout ' ' function to simulate the single knockout of all @GENE$ , and the results of this study are stored in a gene table	1
22802	The remainder of the program handles the printing of the compound , reaction , and gene tables to the files CompoundTbl	1

22820	09 % of HBoV which had been found in coinfected cases were observed as a partner with HRV ( 7 cases )	1
22821	Among 3 Influenza A positive cases , one had been detected without any coinfection partner and 2 had coinfections with adenovirus and HRV ( shown in Table 4 )	1

22831	The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity also varied by the ED ( Figures 6 and 7 )	1
22832	The 1 - day filter , while closely matching the nominal specificity , performed poorly in terms of maximizing the sensitivity to detect an outbreak signature	1
22833	The 7 - day filter , by smoothing over the outbreak signature ( Figure 5 ) , maximized the sensitivity , but at a compromise to the actual specificity obtained ( Figures 6 and 7 )	1
22834	The linear and exponential filters provided a balance between the specificity and sensitivity	1

22839	During the last 100 years , the @GENE$ has diverged from the original genotype by roughly 15 %	1
22840	Might the approximately 1 , 900 nucleotide substitutions be primarily attributed to the genetic drift of perfectly neutral variations ? This seems unlikely for several reasons	1
22841	First , a @GENE$ of approximately 13 , 000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA	1
22842	Not only did 15 % of the genome change , but polymorphisms arose across more than 50 % of the genome	1
22843	This strongly points to extreme mutational pressure , high enough , reasonably , to threaten error catastrophe	1
22844	Second , if some significant portions of the @GENE$ are neutral , deletions of such portions of the @GENE$ should be regularly seen , and selection should favor such deletions , rapidly producing smaller genomes	1
22845	There is no evidence of significantly smaller @GENE$	1
22846	Indeed , there is little evidence of deletion in any of the @GENE$ compared to the 1918 version	1
22847	The only major indels occurred among the oldest samples ( prior to 1948 ) in the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ , or @GENE$ ) , but all of these represented deletions compared to the @GENE$ and all later genomes	1
22848	Third , it is now known that even synonymous mutations are not always neutral	1
22849	Even though they may not directly affect protein sequence , they can affect RNA stability , RNA architecture , speed of translation , and protein folding	1
22850	Fourth , there should only be a finite number of nucleotide positions that are perfectly neutral	1
22851	Because of this , neutral divergence should quickly approach a limit , causing the rate of divergence from the original genotype to slow , but this is not seen	1
22852	Finally , the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral ; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline , attenuation , extinction of most circulating strains , and even more frequent sub - lineage extinction events .	1
22853	In 1957 Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered @GENE$ as a @GENE$ that interfered with viral replication [ 98 ]	1
22854	In the early pioneer work on @GENE$ in the fifties and sixties , TBEV served as a model system , and TBEV was shown to induce @GENE$ after infection and was also sensitive to pretreatment of @GENE$ [ 80 , [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ]	1
22855	Pretreatment of @GENE$ was also found to inhibit KFDV , OHFV , and POWV titers in A549 cells ( adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells ) [ 103 ] , thus @GENE$ pretreatment induced broad spectrum inhibition of TBFVs	1
22856	@GENE$ has also been found to be strongly induced in the brains of @DISEASE$ infected Peromyscus lecuopus , which are known as a natural host of the virus [ 104 ]	1
22857	Similar@GENE$  IFN was found to be induced in sheep infected with LIV [ 105 ] ,@GENE$ enes were induced in brains of @DISEASE$ infected mice , indicating an @GENE$ vated IFN response [ 106 ] .	1

22862	Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS , originating from yolk sac progenitor cells that seed the brain early in development [ 9 ]	1
22863	In addition to a multitude of homeostatic functions throughout development and healthy aging [ 10 , 11 ] , microglia participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns and damage - associated molecular patterns [ 12 ] , which stimulate morphological changes [ 13 , 14 ] and increase production of reactive oxidative species [ 15 , 16 ] and @GENE$ [ 17 , 18 ]	1
22864	During @DISEASE$ , virally infected cells secrete chemokines includi@GENE$ CL5 , and @GENE$ 0 @GENE$ ch fac@GENE$  immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]	1
22865	Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS is a hallmark of @DISEASE$ , and monocytes and T cells are critical for CNS virologic control	1

22867	However , monocytes may also contribute to dissemination of virus to the CNS [ 24 , 25 ] , and inhibition of monocyte infiltration may also protect against nitric oxide - mediated immunopathology [ 26 ]	1

22869	CD8 + T cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from @DISEASE$ via both cytopathic and noncytopathic mechanisms [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ]	1
22870	Mice lacking either CD8 + T cells or MHC - I molecules have @GENE$ urdens , increased mortality after infection , and prolonged viral persistence , suggesting that cell - mediated immunity controls virus within the CNS [ 32 ] .	1
22871	Purification with high performance liquid chromatography was performed with an Agilent 1260 Infinity Binary LC System equipped with a Nucleodur C18 HTec , 5 µm by Macherey Nagel ( Düren , Germany )	1
22872	A gradient from water and acetonitrile ( with 0	1
22873	1 % trifluoroacetic acid respectively ) was utilized to separate the compounds .	1
22874	Frequent and severe @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) constitute an important morbidity factor in our society and a considerable cost burden in terms of medical treatment and time of work - loss [ 1 , 2 ]	1
22875	@DISEASE$ are divided into upper RTIs ( @DISEASE$ ) including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and lower @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ [ 3 ]	1
22876	Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [ 4 , 5 ] and vitamin D status [ 6 , 7 ] are believed to contribute to observed differences in @DISEASE$ risk	1
22877	In addition , the role of @DISEASE$ ( body mass index ( BMI ) = 25	1
22878	0 - 29	1
22879	9 kg / m 2 ) and in particular @DISEASE$ ( BMI ≥ 30 kg / m 2 ) in predisposition to @DISEASE$ is increasingly discussed [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
22880	This growing interest is driven by the rising number of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ individuals worldwide [ 14 ] and the emerging knowledge of notable @DISEASE$ imbalances in association with @DISEASE$ [ 15 ]	1
22881	Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of @DISEASE$ with specific @DISEASE$ and their outcomes	1
22882	Thus , @DISEASE$ was associated with @DISEASE$ [ 8 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 9 ]	1
22883	Moreover , two population - based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [ 10 , 11 ]	1
22884	Two recent Danish population - based studies reported an excess of a large spectrum of @DISEASE$ including @DISEASE$ among @DISEASE$ people [ 12 , 13 ]	1
22885	The overall aim of our study targeting the adult population in South Baden , Germany , is to identify risk factors for the susceptibility to @DISEASE$	1
22886	Here we present data on the role of @DISEASE$ as contributing factor to a high @DISEASE$ burden in the German society and explore effect modification by gender , sports activity and nutritional patterns .	1
22887	The sensitivity of faecal antigen tests for the detection of parvoviruses is influenced by viral load in faeces , as well as by the presence of @GENE$ that can sequestrate viral particles and prevent binding to the test antibody [ 30 ]	1
22888	@DISEASE$ vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are usually below the limit of detection of antigen tests , ranging from 1	1
22889	48 × 10 0 to 2	1
22890	5 × 10 4 copies / mg of faeces in one study [ 24 ] and from ≈ 10 0 to 7	1
22891	50 × 10 5 copies / mg of faeces in another [ 31 ]	1
22892	The lower limit of detection of faecal antigen tests for @DISEASE$ in dogs is 1@GENE$ 6 viral DNA copies per mg of faeces [ 32 ]	1
22893	Lo@GENE$  antibodies in the New Zealand cats could explain the positive faecal antigen test results in those cats with low faecal viral loads .	1
22894	Immunization with a Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Encodes @GENE$ of the @DISEASE$ Virus Suppresses Viral Protein Levels in Mouse Liver	1
22895	Background : @DISEASE$ is among the main causes of illness and death in children < 5 years of age	1
22896	There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in developing countries .	1
22897	For this study , 70 Hy - Line Brown hens were bought from a local farm at the peak of lay ( 28 weeks of age ) and housed in negative , high efficiency particulate air filtered poultry isolators , at the facilities of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie	1
22898	At the farm , birds were vaccinated against @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
22899	Birds received feed and water ad libitum	1
22900	Animal experiment procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Decree of the Ministry of Health n	1

22902	5 / 2014 )	1
22903	Before the experiments , the birds were given a 4 - weeks period to ensure acclimatization to the isolators , and the normalization of laying performances	1
22904	Eggs were collected throughout the study , three times a day	1
22905	Birds were screened for the presence of antibodies against type A Influenza virus nucleoprotein by using a commercial ELISA test ( ID Vet , Montpellier , France ) and re@GENE$ 	1
22906	Female genital tract secretions are often acidic , and the secretions of @DISEASE$ - infected individuals@GENE$ ibody capable of coating virus contained in those secretions	1
22907	These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV - 1 across epithelial cells	1
22908	Our primary finding is that at acidic@GENE$ , IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV - 1 clinical isolates , including transmitted / founder Env - pseudotyped strains	1
22909	Moreo@GENE$ ibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH	1
22910	The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking@GENE$  FcRn , which is known to@GENE$ d Ig@GENE$ lexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH [ 24 , 42 ]	1
22911	We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious	1
22912	Alt@GENE$ odies generally promote more transcytosis , the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediat@GENE$ odies	1
22913	Finally , we demonstrate abu@GENE$  FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra , suggesting that these sites could play a major ro@GENE$  FcRn - mediated immune complex transcytosis .	1
22914	Half - area 96 - well plates ( Corning ) were coated with 5 mg / ml ( 250 ng / well ) of @GENE$ and incubated over night at 4uC	1
22915	Plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature ( RT )	1
22916	After washing , @GENE$ were added at 5 mg / ml ( 250 ng / well ) , and plates were incubated an additional hour at RT	1
22917	Next , virus was added to washed plates ( 20 ng @GENE$ / well ) and incubated for 3 hours at 37uC	1
22918	Unbound virus was removed by washing with PBS	1
22919	Subsequently , 1610 4 TZM - bl cells / well were added in the presence of 10 mg / ml DEAE dextran and incubated for 48 hours at 37uC	1
22920	Cells were then washed , lysed , and developed with @GENE$ assay reagent according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Promega )	1
22921	Luminescence ( relative light units ) was measured using a Synergy 2 microplate luminometer ( BioTek ) .	1
22922	In contrast , it was reported that private hospitals gave less priority to funding for infection control and stewardship policies than public hospitals	1
22923	The stewardship element was not strictly monitored in the private hospitals and clinics , where it was reported that the MOH does not have so much leverage	1
22924	This was raised as a concern by some physicians and policymakers when discussing the extension of @DISEASE$ policies to the private sector :	1
22925	As with publications on bats , research effort on bat - associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the United States , a country with a nationwide surveillance program for monitoring and reporting of Table S2 for species in each category ) .	1

22927	So , there is already a misaligned incentive	1

22932	" - I17 , Animal Health Animal health stakeholders expressed that the not so strict regulations on the import of newer antibiotics with a broader spectrum of activity served as a leeway for some veterinarians to prescribe them even when not clinically needed	1
22933	Participants pointed out that the abuse of reserved antibiotics favored acquisition of @GENE$ by microorganisms , resulting in loss of antibiotic efficacy .	1
22934	Based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table , a systematic and comprehensive city - level total carbon accounting approach was established and applied in one of the China ' s mega city - Guangzhou	1
22935	Total carbon emissions including the fossil fuel combustion in the city ' s boundary and embodied in the imported electricity out of the boundary were still performing a rising tendency	1
22936	Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou , especially after 2009	1
22937	Examining the effects of different boundaries on carbon accounting at city level is crucial for the emissions mitigation in urban China .	1
22938	The literature suggests RNA viruses should be inherently subject to mutational degeneration [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]	1
22939	This includes the bacteriophage MS2 [ 14 ] , the @DISEASE$ [ 15 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 20 ] , Ebola [ 21 , 22 ] , and SARS [ 23 , 24 ]	1
22940	Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation ( " lethal mutagenesis " ) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain extinction [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]	1
22941	There is some long - term historical evidence that supports the concept of natural viral attenuation through mutation accumulation [ 2 ] , and theoretical studies using numerical simulation strongly support the concept of natural and accelerated genetic attenuation of RNA viruses [ 13 ] .	1

22947	RTIs constitute an important morbidity factor considering the high health care costs , the time lost from work , and the impaired quality of life among those recurrently affected [ 1 , 2 , 17 ]	1
22948	@DISEASE$ belongs to one of the host risk factors for @DISEASE$ and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of @DISEASE$ worldwide	1
22949	In the present study , we report on the association of @DISEASE$ with individual @DISEASE$ as well as with a diary score summarising different incident @DISEASE$ symptoms over a period of 18 months	1
22950	Our investigation could demonstrate an association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ confirming previous findings on @DISEASE$ [ 9 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 18 ] and @DISEASE$ [ 10 , 12 ]	1
22951	We also saw an association between @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ / @DISEASE$	1
22952	An elevated risk for @DISEASE$ among @DISEASE$ was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women [ 13 ]	1
22953	None of the two Danish population - based studies [ 12 , 13 ] used ORs of monthly prevalence , but hazard ratios ( HRs ) , as they could identify events on a daily basis	1
22954	The HR of 1	1
22955	6 [ 12 ] for the association with @DISEASE$ and the HR of 1	1
22956	48 [ 13 ] for the association with @DISEASE$ are , however , of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed	1
22957	Mechanistically , excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [ 19 , 20 ]	1
22958	The here observed associations were more prominent for @DISEASE$ compared to URTIs , but evident for both , and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent @DISEASE$ compared to single symptoms	1
22959	Based on the infection diary data , we generated a RTI diary score summing - up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month , per whole season or over the whole period of three years	1
22960	Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome , associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms , and interactions were more pronounced	1
22961	Moreover , the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three - years score , arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection - prone sub - group of the population	1
22962	Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual ' s risk for RTI	1
22963	Among them , cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [ 4 , 5 ]	1
22964	Frequent contact to small children [ 21 , 22 ] , vitamin D deficiency [ 23 , 24 ] , and lack of physical activity [ 25 , 26 ] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks	1
22965	Moreover , higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP [ 27 ]	1
22966	Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders	1
22967	The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age , gender , educational status , contact to children , smoking status , sports activity and nutrition scores , suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections	1
22968	Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably	1
22969	This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non - obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences	1
22970	In addition , some chronic diseases , foremost asthma and COPD , are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ]	1
22971	Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma , COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score	1
22972	Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes	1
22973	Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co - morbidities with both	1
22974	We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women	1
22975	A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort [ 12 ]	1
22976	Several lines of research support this notion : Szabova et al	1
22977	and Ilavska et al	1
22978	reported gender - dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [ 33 , 34 ]	1
22979	The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men [ 34 ]	1
22980	NK cells ( CD3 - / CD16 + / CD56 + ) , represent first - line cells for the clearing of virus - infected cells	1
22981	Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women , but not for respective men , might underlie the gender effect seen in our study	1
22982	We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition	1
22983	Interestingly , an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity	1
22984	Thus , only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non - obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes	1
22985	We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity , but not in normal weight individuals	1
22986	Evidence supporting this has been previously published [ 35 ]	1
22987	An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens	1
22988	Excessive reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection [ 36 ] and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy - deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections [ 37 ] .	1
22989	Lastly , because nucleic acid pools were @GENE$ treated for metagenomic sequencing , potentially reducing detection sensitivity , we used the same nested PCR protocol as used for @GENE$ [ 51 ] to test for the presence of @GENE$ in DNA from individual saliva and fecal swab samples that made up metagenomic pools ( n = 58 ; 28 saliva and 30 feces )	1
22990	As with our blood samples , we randomly selected a subset of positive amplicons for Sanger sequencing .	1
22991	Background : Reactivation of the Bacillus Calmette - Guérin ( BCG ) , manifesting as @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ or crust formation at a previous BCG inoculation site , is a common and highly specific feature of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ )	1
22992	We report the unusual finding of BCG reactivation in an infant with laboratory - confirmed @DISEASE$	1
22993	Case presentation : A previously healthy 7 - month old infant presented initially with @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and subsequently developed @DISEASE$ followed by a typical @DISEASE$	1
22994	There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with @DISEASE$	1
22995	On examination , a 2	1
22996	5 cm area of @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site , in addition to the widespread @DISEASE$	1
22997	No other clinical features of @DISEASE$ were present	1
22998	@DISEASE$ virus was isolated from the throat swab and @DISEA@GENE$ M @GENE$ re present in the serum	1
22999	The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy , and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up	1
23000	Conclusions : This case report highlights the rare finding of BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed @DISEASE$ , and suggests that this clinical manifestation may occasionally occur in children with infections or conditions other than @DISEASE$ .	1
23001	Human adenoviruses ( HAdVs ) have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases	1

23022	Nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3 - month - old pigs at a local slaughterhouse	1
23023	The nasal cavity was opened in the longitudinal axes , and nasal mucosa was removed in strips ( 3 by 8 cm )	1
23024	After the tissues were rinsed with minimum essential medium ( MEM ; Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with antibiotics ( 100 U / ml of penicillin , 100 g / ml of streptomycin , 0	1

23027	2 cm , placed in 12 - well plates , and filled until the top of the compress surface with bronchial epithelial growth medium ( BEGM [ 68 ] ) , supplemented with antibiotics ( see above )	1
23028	Next , the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1 - cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12 - well plates and refilled with medium , keeping the apical side of the tissue at the @DISEASE$	1
23029	After incubation overnight at 37 ° C in 5 % CO 2 , mucus was washed away with BEGM , and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12 - well plates without compresses	1
23030	There tissues were challenged with JEV at 10 5 TCID 50 s / ml in 400 l , incubated for 1	1
23031	5 h at 37 ° C , and washed 3 times with BEGM	1
23032	In order to establish again the @DISEASE$ conditions , mucosa was transferred onto new freshly prepared 12 - well plates with compresses and fresh BEGM with antibiotics	1
23033	After 2 , 24 , and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition and animal was processed for RNA extraction	1
23034	At 72 hpi , additional tissues were embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound ( OCT ; Leica Microsystems )	1
23035	Using a cryostat , nasal mucosa sections at a thickness of 4 m were cut and then fixed with acetone - methanol ( 1 : 1 ) .	1
23036	For in vitro expression studies , transfections were performed using the GeneJammer reagent , following the manufacturer ' s protocols ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA )	1
23037	Briefly , the cells were grown to 50 % confluence in a 35 mm dish and transfected with 1 μg of ZIKV - prME vaccine	1
23038	The cells were collected 2 days after transfection , washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA )	1
23039	Western Blot was used to verify the expression of the @GENE$ from the harvested cell lysate and the immune specificity of the mouse and RM serum through the use of either @GENE$ or immune sera from the ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice , as described previously	1
23040	25 In brief , 3 - 12 % Bis - Tris NuPAGE gels ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) were loaded with 5 μg or 1 μg of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ; transfected cell lysates or supernatant and the Odyssey protein @GENE$ Weight Marker ( Product # 928 - 40000 )	1
23041	The gels were run at 200 V for 50 min in MOPS buffer	1
23042	The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device ( Life Technologies )	1
23043	The membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE , USA ) for 1 h at room temperature	1
23044	To detect vaccine expression , the @GENE$ was diluted 1 : 500 and the immune serum from mice and RM was diluted 1 : 50 in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0	1
23045	2 % Tween 20 ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 ° C	1
23046	The membranes were washed with PBST and then incubated with the appropriate @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ; LI - COR Biosciences ) for mouse serum and flavivirus antibody ; and goat anti - human IRDye800CW ( LI - COR Biosciences ) for RM sera at 1 : 15 , 000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature	1
23047	After washing , the membranes were imaged on the Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR Biosciences ) .	1
23048	In this work we present a new method that addresses these shortcomings	1
23049	Our method , Iterative HFold , takes a pseudoknot - free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any ( density - 2 ) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure	1
23050	Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy , among all structures produced by these methods	1
23051	While one of its underlying methods , HFold , strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis , the other three use iterations to extend or remove the @GENE$ of input structure , with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold	1
23052	Thus , unlike HFold , iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure ( while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same )	1
23053	This is valuable since 1 ) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2 ) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle , there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some @GENE$ in the initially formed pseudoknot - free secondary structure can improve prediction [ 53 , 54 ] .	1
23054	Slow - binding inhibition mechanisms can be investigated by pre - incubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor followed by measurement of the initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis as a function of pre - incubation time	1
23055	In this way , increasing the concentration of diplacone led to a decrease in both the initial velocity ( v i ) and the steady - state rate ( v s ) ( Figs	1
23056	1a , 1b and Supplementary Fig	1
23057	S3a )	1
23058	The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fitted to equation ( 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig	1
23059	S3a ) to determine v i , v s and k obs	1
23060	The results for diplacone were fitted to the a slow - binding process ( equation 3 ; Supplementary Fig	1
23061	S3a ) dependence of k obs on the concentration of @GENE$ ( Fig	1
23062	1c )	1
23063	Based on the above kinetic observations , we conclude that the reaction follows a time - dependent kinetic mechanism ( Fig	1

23075	The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that diplacone inhibits @GENE$ by the rapid formation of an @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) which slowly isomerizes to form a @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) ( Fig	1

23080	52 , 62 Other @GENE$ listed in ViralZone as being related to inhibition of the autophagy process are the neurovirulence factor @GENE$ and @GENE$ from human @DISEASE$ , the protein Nef @GENE$  HIV - 1 , and the protein TRS1@GENE$  human @DISEASE$	1

23083	Although typically the blame of the origins of @DISEASE$ are typically placed on a cultural minority group ( Hagan et al	1
23084	2015 ; Kobayashi et al	1
23085	2015 ; Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c ) , with response action emphasizing individual behavior , prevention of mosquito bites and sexual transmission ( World Health Organization 2017d ; Brym and Lie 2014 ) , however , arguably , in the case of the @DISEASE$ epidemic , considerable responsibility was given to the effects of globalization	1
23086	Globalization has been defined in numerous ways	1
23087	For example , Bryn and Lie ( 2014 ) defined it as the Brapid increases in the volume of international trade , travel , and communication [ which has ] broken down the isolation and independence of most countries and people ^ ( pg	1
23088	27 ) ( Imperato 2016 )	1
23089	This interpretation of globalization will be used of the purposes of this review	1
23090	According to the literature , the interconnectedness between countries through travel facilitated the spread of @DISEASE$ beyond the Zika Forest of Uganda - where it was initially discovered in the 1940s - to South East Asia in the 1960s , the Island of Yap in 2007 , French Polynesia in 2013 , and South America in 2015 ( Gyawali et al	1
23091	2016 ; Imperato 2016 ) .	1
23092	Inadequate collaboration between the various levels of government in Canada was blamed for the apparent inefficiencies and inadequacies in the functioning of the health care system and the response to public health crises	1
23093	This led to disorganized contact tracing , quarantining , and communication to the public ( MacDougall 2007 )	1
23094	Financial challenges within the Canadian Health Care System further enhanced Toronto ' s vulnerability to the @DISEASE$ epidemic , including a lack of resourcing towards public health infrastructure and acute care ( Salehi and Ali 2006 )	1
23095	Similar to MacDougall ( 2007 ) , Salehi and Ali ( 2006 ) point to a lack of cooperation and collaboration between the three levels of government to explain this public health crisis - ownership of responsibility and duty to respond was deflected between each level and remained unclear ( MacDougall 2007 ; Salehi and Ali 2006 ) .	1
23096	Details are provided in Supplementary Data .	1
23097	Several studies have been carried out in experimental conditions to assess the effectiveness of alternatives to colistin for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs ( Table 4 )	1
23098	Here , we give an overview of studies published in 2015 or 2016 .	1
23099	x is the spatial location c is the pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid , 10 6 pfu / ml for the SARS - CoV [ 39 ]	1
23100	p is the pulmonary ventilation rate , 7	1
23101	5 l / min [ 18 ]	1
23102	f ( t ) is the viability function of pathogens in the aerosols	1
23103	Since the SARS - CoV may retain its infectivity for minutes and gradual loss for as long as several days [ 40 , 41 ] , the viability function of the SARS - CoV is taken as 75 % after aerosolization and remains the same during the first a few minutes [ 22 , 40 , 41 ]	1
23104	m is the total number of size bins	1
23105	N c is the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough , N c = V c c , where V c is the total volume of the droplets produced in a cough , 6	1
23106	7 × 10 - 3 ml [ 18 , 42 ] h l is the ratio of the number of droplets of the lth size bin in a cough to the number of injected particles in the numerical model , in which the number of droplets of the lth size bin can be calculated according to the original size distribution of the cough and V c	1
23107	v ( x , t ) is the volume density of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of the subject induced by one cough , ml / l of air	1
23108	The breathing zone of each passenger can be defined as a hemisphere with 0	1
23109	3 m radius at the nose [ 18 ]	1
23110	For the human model used in this work , the volume of the breathing zone is 0	1
23111	005721 m 3 for each passenger	1
23112	Then v ( x , t ) can be calculated according to the CFD simulation results as the total volume of all the expiratory droplets in the breathing zone divided by the volume of the breathing zone [ 43 ]	1
23113	β l is the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols of the lth size bin , % , which can be calculated according to the size and deposition location of the aerosols [ 44 ]	1
23114	According to the infection mechanism of SARS , the @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) has been confirmed to be the receptor of the SARS - CoV	1
23115	The @GENE$ can be detected in ciliated airway epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions	1
23116	And the infectivity of the SARS - CoV on the ciliated airway epithelial cells derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions shows no difference [ 45 ]	1
23117	So the aerosols that deposit in the head airway and tracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract can be accounted in the intake dose [ 44 ]	1
23118	It was tedious and time - consuming to model every cough during the exposure time interval to obtain v ( x , t ) at different locations	1
23119	Considering other aerodynamic size - dependent factors , a stochastic non - Table 4 The cases investigated in the numerical simulation threshold dose - response model for airborne pathogens can be formed [ 38 ] :	1
23120	. 3 % increase in the average intake fraction	1
23121	Besides , some of the passengers seated 2 - 3 rows behind and 4 - 7 rows in front of the index patient may also have lower intake fractions after the movement	1
23122	Thus the variation of the intake fractions also depends on the location of the passengers and the index patient	1
23123	Besides , although the intake fractions of the passengers are changed by the movement of the standing person , no significant differences can be found between the distribution characteristics of the intake fractions of different cases	1
23124	Passengers seated farther away from the index patient have much lower intake fractions .	1
23125	Ventilation plays a dual role in formation of indoor pollutant concentrations : on one hand it removes pollutants generated indoors from indoor spaces by ventilating the space with outdoor air , on the other hand , ventilation introduces outdoor air pollutants indoors [ 11 , 12 ]	1
23126	Assuming a constant outdoor pollution level and constant penetration efficiency , increasing ventilation directly leads to increased indoor exposures to outdoor pollutants	1
23127	Even in the case of efficient filtering of particles in the intake air , detailed studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the outdoor air enters indoors via windows , doors , ventilation ducts , and cracks and leaks in the building envelope , leading to much lower actual filtration efficiency [ 13 ] .	1
23128	Autophagy is a cellular pathway for self - degradation	1
23129	The pathway allows a cell to degrade @GENE$ , aggregated proteins and organelles during periods of starvation to provide nutrients for continued cellular processes , as well as playing an important role in cellular homeostasis , ageing and development [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ]	1
23130	In addition , dysregulation of autophagy plays an important role in the development of some @DISEASE$ [ 16 ]	1
23131	During autophagy , regions of the cytoplasm become engulfed into double membrane bound vesicles termed autophagosomes	1
23132	These vesicles then fuse with late endosomes / lysosomes , where the contents are degraded b@GENE$ s ( Figure 2 )	1
23133	For detailed reviews of autophagy signaling , see [ 17 , 18 ]	1
23134	The major control complex for autophagy i@GENE$ R @GENE$ t of rapamycin ) which , when active , inhibits initiation of the pathway @GENE$ R senses amino acid levels , as well as levels of growth factors and glucose and genotoxic and ER stress	1

23136	Under stimulatory conditions @GENE$ R is inactivated ; th@GENE$ x becomes hypophosphorylated and relocates to the site of formation of the autophagosome , the phagophore	1
23137	Formation of the autophagosome proceeds by addition of new membrane to the phagophore , as opposed to budding from an existing membrane , in a poorly understood process	1
23138	However , a number of proteins are known to be required	1
23139	Recruitment of these proteins occurs via the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) by th@GENE$ x @GENE$ K ) , includin@GENE$ 1 @GENE$ 1 )	1
23140	Inhibition o@GENE$ K activity using drugs such as wortmannin and 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - MA ) , and sequestration of BECN1 by antiapoptotic protein B - cell lymphoma / leukemia - 2 ( Bcl2 ) all inhibit autophagy .	1
23141	Our data show that @DISEASE$ tract infections are the most common trigger for @DISEASE$ exacerbations in both preschool - and school - aged children ( Figure 2 )	1
23142	The importance of respiratory infectious agents , both viruses ( e	1
23143	g	1
23144	, @DISEASE$ , rhinovirus , metapneumovirus , @DISEASE$ , and coronavirus ) and bacteria ( e	1
23145	g	1
23146	, Chlamydia pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , in the development of @DISEASE$ exacerbations has been stressed by several authors [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
23147	The role of infections in @DISEASE$ is even more evident in the first years of life	1
23148	Indeed , our results highlight that almost all the @DISEASE$ preschool - aged children had an underlying @DISEASE$	1
23149	On the other hand , one - third of the children aged 6 or more had an @DISEASE$ exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger , whereas in 10 % the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit	1
23150	In fact , several agents can elicit @DISEASE$ : @DISEASE$ , environmental allergens , pollutants , and stress [ 14 , 15 ]	1
23151	Moreover , synergistic interactions between these factors might also very likely play a role [ 14 ] .	1
23152	We first considered rescaling the network formed by the node sampling methods in a similar way to that for the RMS method	1
23153	We used the average weighted - degree of the sampled nodes kw sampled l ¼ 1 = N S P i [ S P j ( a ij þ a ji ) to estimate the total weight of the original networkW original ¼ kw sampled lN = 2 , and rescale the network as in equation ( 2	1
23154	1 ) but using the estimate for the total weight of the original network	1
23155	However , as shown in electronic supplementary material , figure S6 , these scaled networks result in significant overpredictions of epidemic size , particularly when small percentages of the nodes are sampled	1
23156	For the remainder of this paper , we therefore use the unscaled versions of the node sampling methods .	1
23157	The immunological relationships between hantaviruses and their rodent reservoir hosts are complex	1
23158	Infection typically leads to disseminated infection within a few days but without conspicuous signs of disease	1
23159	Expression of @GENE$ can be detected in as little as a few days that suggests innate and adaptive immune activation , but the magnitude of expression is substantially less than in @DISEASE$ pathology models	1
23160	The lack of reagents and methodologies for studying hantavirus reservoirs , most of which are not model organisms , presents a significant challenge	1
23161	However , new technologies have recently emerged that are cost effective and species - independent , but which generate large amounts of data that require substantial computational and bioinformatics support for data reduction	1
23162	With these tools , it should be possible to accelerate research to understand the relationships of @DISEASE$ and their reservoir hosts	1
23163	work was provided by the Department of Microbiology , Immunology and Pathology , Colorado State University ( TS ) , NIH grant AI054461 ( TS ) , and Intramural Program of NIAID , NIH ( JP ) .	1
23164	Determination of sensitivity and specificity of the HCV strip	1
23165	To assess the sensitivity of the HCV strip , a panel of 23 standard positive sera were simultaneously measured by the ELISA , DAS - @GENE$ , @GENE$ and RT - PCR methods	1
23166	In addition , serial dilutions of a reference panel with known amounts of @GENE$ with a concentration from 8 NCU / ml ( NCU meaning national clinical unit ) to 0	1
23167	5 NCU / ml were measured by the DAS - LFIA strip	1
23168	To assess the specificity and accuracy the ddH 2 0 , positive enhancement sample ( a set of quality control references for anti - HCV antibody detection that contains known amounts of @GENE$ ; Artron BioResearch Inc	1
23169	) , BS control and 8 @DISEASE$ patients were analyzed by the DAS - LFIA strip .	1
23170	Target sequences were as follows : @GENE$ ( acc	1
23171	n ° D	1
23172	Methods : Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal ( frequency range 34 to 52 Hz ) and respiratory epithelial cells ( frequency 3 to 18 Hz ) were captured using a high - speed digital video recorder	1
23173	To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin	1
23174	Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated @GENE$ system .	1
23175	In recent years , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) have been identified that are important regulators of antiviral responses	1
23176	Activation of TLR / @GENE$ pathways leads to the expression of several @GENE$ [ 98 ] that likely are important in lymphocyte functions [ 99 ]	1
23177	Because hantavirus Gn targets @GENE$ [ 61 ] , it is possible that these @GENE$ are dysregulated , which could provide the virus an advantage over the host cell response	1
23178	While @GENE$ expression has been evaluated in @DISEASE$ - infected human endothelial cells , epithelial cells and macrophages [ 100 , 101 ] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of m@GENE$ n reservoir host cells infected with @DISEASE$	1
23179	Considering the importance of miRN@GENE$ ost responses , it is likely they play an instrumental role in the immunological events leading to persistent infection of the reservoir hosts	1
23180	The use of RNA - Seq can identify global miRN@GENE$ ession [ 102 ] and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs .	1
23181	As a historical record of epidemic spread , viral genetic sequence data may offer a valuable source of information for the empirical verification of epidemiological models	1
23182	Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power , for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [ 13 ] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [ 3 , 14 ]	1
23183	More generally , it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [ 15 ]	1
23184	Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data , however , typically fit parameter - rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [ 16 ]	1
23185	Together with potential sampling bias , this complicates phylogeographic tasks , such as the characterization of source - sink dynamics in @DISEASE$	1
23186	It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [ 3 , 14 , 17 ] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection .	1
23187	70 µmol , 1 eq ) was dissolved in 20 ml ethanol	1
23188	Catalytic amounts of N , N - dimethylformamide were added and oxalylchloride ( 7	1
23189	2 µl , 84 µmol , 1	1
23190	2 eq ) were added dropwise with vigorous stirring	1
23191	The reaction mixture was stirred overnight after which the solvents were evaporated .	1
23192	This ' defense ' model to explain @GENE$ evolution , combined with the importance of @GENE$ for the fitness of several RNA viruses , allows us to generate a mechanistic hypothesis for the conflict that may have driven the rapid evolution of @GENE$	1
23193	In our model , ADP - ribosylation functions as a post - translational modification of either host or @GENE$ ( Figure 5A )	1
23194	We posit that @GENE$ are recruited to sites of ADP - ribosylation by their @GENE$ , most of which are predicted to be able to recognize , but not remove ADP - ribose ( Figure S5 ) , to exert either direct antiviral functions or recruit other @GENE$	1
23195	Recruitment of catalytically active @GENE$ could also facilitate further ADP - ribosylation of @GENE$ , allowing @GENE$ to rapidly ' amplify ' an initial signal of ADPr	1
23196	Such a model of amplification by recruitment and additional ADP - ribosylation by @GENE$ has been seen at sites of DNA damage , where @GENE$ activation by ADPr leads to increased ADP - ribosylation [ 7 , 8 ]	1
23197	We hypothesize that some viruses have overcome this @GENE$ - mediated antiviral response by direct antagonism of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ )	1
23198	Such antagonism could drive the rapid evolution we see in several regions of the @GENE$ , including but not limited to the @GENE$	1
23199	However , other viruses , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , have evolved their own macrod@GENE$ her cleave ADP - ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with macro @GENE$ re@GENE$  order to overcome the effects of the macro @GENE$ ough speculative , our model provides testable hypotheses about the genetic and physical interactions between PARP m@GENE$ l @GENE$ ADP - ribose , and their consequences in terms of determining outcomes of viral infections in cells .	1
23200	K - estimator [ 64 ] was used for all pairwise sequence analyses of dN / dS ratios	1
23201	For comparisons of the large @GENE$ of vertebrate @GENE$ ( e	1
23202	g	1
23203	@GENE$ and @GENE$ ) , we used K - estimator to distinguish high pairwise dN / dS values due to positive selection from the possibility that these sequences are neutrally evolving , but that stochastic fluctuations in small mutation numbers cause apparently large dN / dS ratio differences	1
23204	For a pair of sequences with a certain number of observed mutations , K - estimator uses Monte Carlo simulations to obtain " bootstrap " estimates of how likely it would be to see high dN / dS values if sequences were neutrally evolving	1
23205	For example , comparing human and rhesus PARP4 exon 30 ( @GENE$ ratio of 1	1
23206	75 ) , there is greater than 95 % confidence that a dN / dS ratio of 1	1
23207	75 represents a significant signature of positive selection	1
23208	Sliding window analyses were performed on pairs of aligned @GENE$ with a window size of @GENE$ and a step size of 50 @GENE$ .	1
23209	Median CRP level at admission was 21 mg / l ( IQR : 6 - 63 , mean : 56	1
23210	6 mg / l ) , median PCT level was 4	1
23211	6 ng / ml ( IQR : 0	1
23212	4 - 26	1
23213	4 , mean : 31	1
23214	5 ng / ml )	1
23215	Median CRP and PCT levels were higher in hypoxemic compared with @DISEASE$ cases ( P = 0	1
23216	03 and P = 0	1
23217	007 , respectively ) .	1
23218	Some invasive serotypes were detected selectively in @DISEASE$ cases but not in the controls ( i	1
23219	e	1
23220	, serotypes 1 and 5 were associated with the risk of @DISEASE$ )	1
23221	A previous study of serotypes involved in @DISEASE$ in Mali found that serotype 5 was the most prevalent ( 54 % ) [ 20 ]	1
23222	It was also linked with @DISEASE$ in our series	1
23223	In other sub - Saharan African countries , serotype 1 was described as the most prevalent serotype of @DISEASE$ [ 21 ]	1
23224	It was the second serotype significantly associated with @DISEASE$ in children in Mali	1
23225	Thus , the introduction of PCV in routine immunization programs in Mali would substantially reduce @DISEASE$ caused by S	1
23226	pneumoniae because most serotypes eliciting @DISEASE$ would be covered by the vaccine [ 22 ]	1
23227	In addition , @DISEASE$ seasonality was similar to that observed previously in Burkina Faso , a neighbouring country , in 2007 - 2011 with higher incidence during the dry season between January and May [ 23 ]	1
23228	Interestingly , among the 4 microbial agents associated with @DISEASE$ , 3 were viruses : human metapneumovirus , RSV , and influenza A virus	1
23229	Self et al	1
23230	recently observed , in a @DISEASE$ cases - control study implemented in hospitals of Utah , that detection respiratory syncytial virus , human metapneumovirus and influenza from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample of patients with @DISEASE$ probably indicates an etiologic role [ 24 ] .	1
23231	This work aims to highlight that , when developing models for public health use , we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks .	1
23232	Recurrent @DISEASE$ after liver transplantation has increasingly become a major clinical issue that the hepatologist and transplant surgeons should face	1
23233	During the past decade , numerous therapeutic approaches based on both basic research and clinical evidences have been reported , but the effective strategy still needs more efforts to be approved	1
23234	Meanwhile , many critical questions remain in several aspects of @DISEASE$ , including the viral infection cycle activities , the detailed structure , composition , and function of the HCV virion in host cells	1
23235	In addition , current standard of therapeutic formula consisting o@GENE$ N combined with ribavirin and a@GENE$ A inhibitor is ineffective or only partially effective	1
23236	In fact , as reviewed in this paper , many novel inhibitors o@GENE$ s targetin@GENE$ s and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat @DISEASE$	1
23237	Hopefully , these future strategies will improve the overall outcome of @DISEASE$ recipients after liver transplantation [ 101 ] .	1
23238	In treatment of genotype 1 @DISEASE$ , the first generation of DAAs , telaprevir and boceprevir were recently used to enhance the efficacy of the standard regiment , Pegylated IFN plus RBV [ 76 ]	1
23239	Although DAAs significantly increase the SVR rate in naïve patients , relapsers , and nonresponders [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] , evidence is still limited about their efficacy in recurrent @DISEASE$ after LT	1
23240	In addition , there are some limitations for safety and tolerance	1
23241	One critical limitation is the potential interaction with CNI	1
23242	One recent study in healthy volunteers showed that boceprevir increased the area under the curve of CsA and Tac by 2	1
23243	7 and of 17 , respectively , [ 77 ]	1
23244	Another study reported that the concomitant administration of immunosuppressive therapy with telaprevir in healthy volunteers increased CsA and Tac exposures by approximately 4	1
23245	6 - fold and 70 - fold , respectively [ 78 ]	1
23246	In 2012 , several teams have communicated preliminary results of DAAs use after LT , which are summarized by Coilly et al	1
23247	[ 79 ]	1
23248	Overall , at 12 weeks of triple therapy , a complete early virological response ( EVR ) was obtained in 71 % of patients treated with boceprevir and in 73 % of patients treated with telaprevir	1
23249	Notably , the CsA dose should be reduced by 1	1
23250	3 - fold with boceprevir and fourfold with telaprevir	1
23251	The Tac dose should be reduced by fivefold with boceprevir and 35 - fold with telaprevir	1
23252	It was concluded that DAAs could completely change the prognosis of patients with severe @DISEASE$ recurrence and offer new perspectives for the treatment of @DISEASE$ recurrence in @DISEASE$ patients .	1
23253	Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined according to four scenarios , as follows : ( A ) equal rates , ( B ) rates proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them ( in terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to another ) , ( C ) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a standard phylogeographic model ( undertaken with and without BSSVS to reduce the number of rate parameters ) and ( D ) a GLM model that only considers air travel as a predictor	1
23254	To compare the spread of @DISEASE$ under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread , we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times ( across 100 simulations ) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico ( based on World Health Organization data ; Text S1 )	1
23255	Correspondence was measured using the Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient , and tested with associated p - values obtained using a permutation test ( Text S1 ) , as well as using the mean average error ( MAE ; in days )	1
23256	We consider the @GENE$ ' s rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers , which are clearly present in the observed peaks	1
23257	Therefore , the scaling of between - population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman ' s rank correlation .	1
23258	HRV was the most prevalent pathogen in both symptomatic ( 31	1
23259	5 % ) and asymptomatic ( 23 % ) cases	1
23260	However , the difference in detection rates of HRV between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases did not generate a significant P - value ( P = 0	1
23261	404 )	1
23262	For adenovirus , the rate of pathogen detection was higher in asymptomatic specimens ( 10 % ) than that of in symptomatic specimens ( 7 % ) , although the difference in detection rate between these two categories of specimens was not statistically significant	1
23263	Similarly , for HMPV and S	1
23264	pneumoniae , the difference in detection rate between the symptomatic and asymptomatic attacks were not significant ( P = 0	1
23265	219 and P = 1	1
23266	00 , respectively )	1
23267	On the other hand , RSV detection rate was significantly higher in symptomatic specimens than asymptomatic specimen ( P = 0	1
23268	004 ) , suggesting the potential involvement of RSV in @DISEASE$	1
23269	Finally , multiple pathogens were detected in only 7 % ( 2 / 30 ) of asymptomatic specimens and this detection rate was significantly lower than the detection rate of multiple pathogens in symptomatic specimens ( 36 % , P = 0	1
23270	0007 ) , implying possible pathogenic role of multiple pathogens in @DISEASE$ symptoms	1
23271	It is mentionable here that we couldn ' t detect any other bacteria other than two isolates of S	1
23272	pneumoniae in 30 asymptomatic cases .	1
23273	Also , we analyzed coinfection data in terms of co - occurrences of 2 or more pathogens in the host , such as viral - viral , viral - bacterial , viral - viral - bacterial , and viral - bacterial - bacterial patterns	1
23274	As we can see in Table 4 , HRV was observed as the most predominant coinfection partner , showing its presence with almost all of the pathogens	1
23275	The major coinfection viral partners of HRV included RSV ( six ) , HPIV - 3 ( five ) HMPV ( four ) , adenovirus ( four ) , HBoV ( three ) , and Inf A ( one ) viruses	1
23276	In addition , HRV was co - detected in 9 out of 10 @DISEASE$ cases , whereas it was co - detected in only five S	1
23277	pneumoniae cases	1
23278	After HRV , RSV was the second most predominant pathogen and it was co - detected mainly with S	1
23279	pneumoniae , K	1
23280	pneumoniae , Streptococcus species , E	1
23281	agglomerans , and H	1
23282	influenzae and a total of 20 bacterial isolates had been found with @DISEASE$ .	1
23283	The one - step prediction error process , { E k , t } is where we define c k , 0 = 1 and c k , j = - b k , j for j = 1 ,	1
23284	.	1
23285	, m	1
23286	The process { E k , t } is a filtering of { @GENE$ } and so if { @GENE$ } is stationary , by the linear time invariant filtering result for stationary processes , { E k , t } is also stationary ( [ 18 ] , Theorem 4	1
23287	10	1
23288	1 )	1
23289	Moreover for large enough m , if { X k , t } is an invertible time series process then we can approximate { @GENE$ k , t } by an autoregressive , AR ( m ) process ( [ 18 ] , Theorem 4	1
23290	4	1
23291	3 )	1
23292	Using this approximation we can argue that { @GENE$ } is approximately a mean zero Gaussian independent and identically distributed process with variance gamma γ X , k ( 0 )	1
23293	Let { a 0 ,	1
23294	.	1
23295	, a L - 1 } denote a pre - specified filter of width L	1
23296	We define the detection process { @GENE$ k , t } by filtering the error process { @GENE$ } using this filter	1
23297	Thus , By the filtering result for stationary processes , stationarity of { @GENE$ , t } implies that { @GENE$ } is also a stationary process .	1
23298	We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children ' s emergency departments	1
23299	These models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series , as well as time series dependencies on daily and weekly seasonal scales	1
23300	Respiratory - related outbreak signature detection is based on filtering the one - step - ahead prediction errors obtained from the time series models for the respiratory - complaint background .	1
23301	Post weaning @DISEASE$ in pigs : risk factors and non - colistin - based control strategies	1
23302	Within the entire human H1N1 lineage , only 56 % of all nucleotide sites were invariant , indicating intense mutation pressure	1
23303	Before its apparent extinction in 2009 , the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations ( mostly point mutations ) , including 320 non - synonymous mutations , compared to the 1918 genotype	1
23304	Across all 3 , 755 @GENE$ isolated from humans ( i	1
23305	e	1
23306	, including the outbreak and non - outbreak porcine versions ) , we found that only 41	1
23307	8 % of all nucleotide sites were invariant	1
23308	Multiple variant forms ( i	1
23309	e	1
23310	, 3 - fold and 4 - fold degeneracy , meaning 3 and sometimes 4 different nucleotides observed at a given site ) occurred at 21 % of the @GENE$ , further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non - adaptive	1
23311	When we included the porcine @GENE$ genotypes , only 36	1
23312	1 % of sites remained invariant , with a similar distribution of nucleotide degeneracy	1
23313	Because the re - introduced H1N1 lineage had accumulated fewer mutations than the porcine H1N1 strains , the disappearance of the human lineage and the subsequent dominance of the 2009 porcine strain in the human population resulted in even more divergence from the 1918 stain : over 1900 nucleotide differences ( approximately 15 % divergence ) and 325 amino acids differences ( approximately 7 % divergence in protein sequence ) .	1
23314	In light of these findings , what are the medical implications ? Does mutation accumulation really have anything to do with virulence ? Simonsen , et al	1
23315	[ 2 ] showed mortality statistics for three @DISEASE$ strains over multiple years ( H1N1 from 1918 to 1987 ; H2N2 from 1958 to 1962 ; and H3N2 from 1968 to 1995 )	1
23316	Even though there is some debate concerning the mortality burden imposed by @DISEASE$ viruses [ 63 ] , there has clearly been a continuous exponential decline in influenza - related mortality over time , and this is true for all three major serotypes	1
23317	Since there is a strong linear correlation between mutation count and time ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , and since there is also a close correlation between declining virus - related death rates and time , there is obviously also a correlation between mutation count and reduced death rates	1
23318	Reduction in mortality may be due to many other factors , including herd immunity , advances in medicine , and advances in hygiene , but would these other factors be expected to follow so tightly the time courses seen in Simonsen ? There have been major medical advances since 1918 , and these have clearly been a factor in reducing @DISEASE$	1
23319	Therefore , the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some	1
23320	However , while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918 , such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world	1
23321	Second , the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve , while medical advances have occurred in bursts ( e	1
23322	g	1
23323	, the breakthrough in antibiotics , and the more recent development of antivirals )	1
23324	Third , each of the great @DISEASE$ pandemics ( 1918 , 1956 , 1968 ) involved the emergence of a new viral strain , which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe	1
23325	This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance	1
23326	Finally , the correlation between the exponential decline of @DISEASE$ and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1	1
23327	Our other evidences include : a ) the extinction of all human @DISEASE$ strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain ; b ) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956 , and then again apparently in 2009 ; and c ) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity , approaching random codon usage .	1
23328	The first step of virus replication starts when the virus binds to its receptor and is taken up into the cell by receptor - mediated endocytosis	1
23329	The attachment is mediated by @GENE$ and entry receptor on the host cell	1
23330	The entry receptor for @DISEASE$ has not been identified , but attachment to heparan sulphate and glycosaminoglycan , which are present in abundance on many cell types of both vertebrates and ticks , is predicted to play a role during binding and entry [ 72 ]	1
23331	Once the virus has entered the cell , it is transported to endosomes , where the acidic environment of these vesicles leads to reorganization and conformational change of @GENE$ ein , resulting in the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane and the release of @GENE$ sid into the cytoplasm [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]	1
23332	@GENE$ RN@GENE$ RNA ) also functions@GENE$ RNA , associating with ribosomes to produce @GENE$ ein	1
23333	@GENE$ ain of the viral protein is recognized as a signal peptide and recruits @GENE$ lex to the ER membrane , where it is co - translationally translocated into the ER membrane [ 76 , 77 ]	1
23334	The nascent polypeptide is then processed by @GENE$ ses i@GENE$ ins	1
23335	Some of @GENE$ ins such@GENE$ S2@GENE$ S4A , @GENE$ S4B integrate and alter the membrane of the ER to form a membrane vesicular structure , with a small pore connecting the interior of the vesicle to the cytoplasm [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ]	1
23336	These vesicles are the site for the formation@GENE$ xe@GENE$  RC ) and RNA replication [ 80 , 82 , 83 ]	1
23337	Following RNA replicatio@GENE$ RNA is proposed to exit the vesicle through the vesicular pore and is packaged@GENE$ ins into @GENE$  NC on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane [ 82 , 84 , 85 ]	1
23338	During the process of budding@GENE$  NC from the cytoplasm into the ER , it acquires the lipid envelope along w@GENE$ ins , which are associated with the ER membrane	1
23339	The mechanism that ensures efficient incorporation@GENE$  NC into the ER membrane with the E and prM protein is poorly understood	1
23340	Following budding into the ER lumen , the immature virions are transported through the cellular secretory pathways in a COPI and COPII dependent manner [ 86 ] to the extracellular medium	1
23341	The immature virion has heterodimers of E and prM that completely cover the lipid bilayer to form a spiky proteinaceous coat	1
23342	During the transport through the Golgi , the E protein is glycosylated [ 87 ]	1
23343	The acidic environment of the Golgi induces conformational changes in the E and prM proteins , which exposes a cleavage site on prM	1
23344	Cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin results in the formation of a mature virion [ 88 , 89 ]	1
23345	Mature virions are then released by exocytosis , which completes the viral life cycle [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] ( Figure 2 ) .	1
23346	Although not included in the current study , @GENE$ in BAL fluid is another notable biomarker for the diagnosis of @DISEASE$	1
23347	@GENE$ is reportedly a potent discriminator of @DISEASE$ from non - infectious lung infiltrations [ 12 , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ]	1
23348	However , the proposed cutoff values of sTREM - 1 @GENE$ ion vary widely ( 5 - 900 pg / ml ) and some studies have questioned the reliability of BAL fluid sTREM - 1 @GENE$ 9 ] [ 30 ]	1
23349	Studies on BAL fluid sTREM - 1 @GENE$ y been confined to patients with @DISEASE$	1
23350	Therefore , the usefulness of sTREM - 1 for etiologic diagnosis @GENE$ E$ , especially differential diagnosis of @DISEASE$ , has not been elucidated yet	1
23351	The current study directly compared patients with @DISEASE$ , and therefore differs from previous studies of sTREM - 1	1
23352	BAL fluid sTREM - 1 concentration in combination@GENE$ BAL fluid ce@GENE$ file might exhibit better diagnostic performance , although this warrants further studies .	1
23353	The fluorescent reporter dyes were FAM ( endogenous control ) , Texas Red ( SQPV ) and Cy5 ( SADV ) , with quenchers BHQ - 1 , BHQ - 2 and BHQ - 3 , respectively , chosen to ensure minimal spectral overlap ( Marras 2006 )	1
23354	@GENE$ were designed concurrently with the @GENE$ using AlleleID ® v	1
23355	7 ( Premier Biosoft , CA , USA ) and were trialled first in uniplex using Precision [UNK] Master Mix without SYBR ® Green ( Primer Design , Southampton , UK )	1
23356	Optimal probe concentrations were determined as for primer concentration optimisation	1
23357	The optimal amount of sample ( unknown quantity of target ) @GENE$ per reaction was defined as the largest amount of total DNA that showed a low C p across all assays but which avoided excessive dilution of samples ( thereby not affecting the analytical sensitivity of the assay ) .	1

23359	The primers used in this study were previously described including @GENE$ ( 5 ′ - CATGCTCCTCGGTGGTCTCA - 3 ′ ) and @GENE$ ( 5 ′ - GTCCGGGTCCATCACAGGGT - 3 ′ ) [	1
23360	Results : We report a 2 - reaction amplicon - based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains , representing three subgroups ( A2 , B1 and B2 ) , directly from clinical samples	1
23361	In addition to reporting five @GENE$ from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available @GENE$	1
23362	We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71	1
23363	3 and 80 % for HMPV group A and B , respectively , the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for @GENE$ and @GENE$ , and multiple subgroups co - circulated in various countries	1
23364	Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in @GENE$ length ( 219 to 241 amino acids ) due to changes in the @GENE$ position	1
23365	Genome - wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and @GENE$ .	1
23366	@GENE$ catalyzes the removal of a terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates and plays a pivotal role in nutrition , cellular interactions and pathogenesis mediating various @DISEASE$ including @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
23367	An array of antiviral siali@GENE$ s have been developed and are commercially available , such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating @DISEASE$	1
23368	However , the development of bacterial siali@GENE$ itors has been much less successful	1
23369	Here , natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp - @GENE$ iali@GENE$ Clostridium perfringens , are reported	1
23370	This bacterium causes various @DISEASE$	1
23371	The crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic d@GENE$ est inhibitor , diplacone , is also presented	1
23372	This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme - inhibitor co@GENE$ de a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural@GENE$ s , which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti - sialidase agents .@GENE$ 	1
23373	Recently , chronic activation of innate immune response by microglia is believed to be a major contributor to @DISEASE$ [ 72 ]	1
23374	Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common @DISEASE$ , such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis , rather than a secondary response [ 73 ]	1
23375	We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement - mediated synapse elimination [ 8 , 74 , 75 ]	1
23376	Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation , researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of mod@GENE$  improve neurological function , including @DISEASE$ [ 38 , 39 ] , brain irradiation [ 50 ] , @DISEASE$ [ 76 ] , experimental @DISEASE$ [ 40 ] , and @DISEASE$ [ 41 ]	1
23377	However , our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in t@GENE$  , as well as decreased peripheral @DISEASE$ activation	1
23378	Thus , in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism , it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and periphera@GENE$ ne compartments .	1
23379	Although , total numbers of cells do not show consistent results , clonal expansion within the B cell compartment can be studied	1
23380	A specific immune response to an agent typically has an initial inherent immune component that leads to antigen presentation to effector cells	1
23381	Receptors on the effector cell surface ( @GENE$ in T cells and @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , or antibody , in B cells ) bind specific targeted areas of the agent , termed @GENE$	1
23382	Specific recognition by T and B lymphocytes leads to stimulation , lymphocyte replication and clonal expansion ; what is termed an oligoclonal response	1
23383	Oligoclonal expansion is shown in peripheral IgM + B cells in @DISEASE$ [ 5 ]	1
23384	Detailed pathological studies have revealed what are termed oligoclonal plasma cell infiltrates in @DISEASE$ arterial specimens [ 101 ] , leading to t@GENE$ of antibody J and association with the pr@GENE$ spheroid ICIs as previously discussed [ 102 , 103 ] .	1
23385	All 11 @GENE$ sequences from cats from Dubai fell into a single clade containing four unique sequence types and which was not clearly related to any other of the FPV sequences	1
23386	In contrast , those viruses sampled from New Zealand in 2017 were either identical ( eight of nine animals ) or clearly very closely related to a vaccine strain ( Felocell , Zoetis Pty Ltd	1
23387	) and taken from cats with a history of recent vaccination	1
23388	The single sequence that was not identical to that of the vaccine strain exhibited just two nucleotide substitutions , one of which was non - synonymous ( E155K ) ( Table 4 ) .	1
23389	Sections of bone marrow examined were either hypocellular , characterised by increased numbers of , predominantly , adipocytes and extravasated erythrocytes interspersed with very low numbers of erythroid and myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes , or hypercellular , with increased numbers of myeloid and erythroid precursors	1
23390	Some sections of the liver demonstrated @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , with minimal periportal mononuclear infiltrates	1
23391	Among the sections of myocardium examined , there were no significant lesions .	1
23392	@DISEASE$ is found in Russia and North America , and is the only @DISEASE$ present in America ( Figure 1 ) [ 48 ]	1
23393	It is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis , Ixodes cookei , and several other Ixodes tick species , to small and medium size mammals , whereas humans are accidental dead - end hosts	1
23394	Milk - borne @DISEASE$ transmission might also be possible since @DISEASE$ virus has been found to be secreted in milk under experimental settings [ 49 ] .	1
23395	The FRET assay was carried out to confirm that @GENE$ activity was responsible for the antiviral activity shown by SCH07072 cells [ 32 ] ( Figure 4 )	1
23396	SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) 80 min after the @GENE$ was introduced into the cells	1
23397	However , the fluorescence output from HeLa cells , muSCH cells , and the negative control reactant was a maximum of 200 RFU or less ( Figure 4A )	1
23398	When the @GENE$ was introduced into cells , SCH07072 and muSCH cells had fluorescence levels of about 200 RFU , but HeLa cells and the negative control reactant showed fluorescence levels of only 80 RFU ( Figure 4B )	1
23399	These @GENE$ results confirmed that @GENE$ in SCH07072 had both @GENE$ and @GENE$ activity , but that only @GENE$ activity was observed in muSCH cells ( Figure 4 )	1
23400	Therefore , the protection against the virus infection shown by SCH07072 cells was due to @GENE$ activity against the @GENE$ itself .	1
23401	Here , we empirically test for the first time whether ants , Myrmica rubra , which are common in Europe [ 46 ] and an invasive species in North America [ 47 ] , can be alternative hosts of @DISEASE$ and if foodborne transmission is feasible	1
23402	Monitoring of viral loads after consumption of virus - infected food will shed light on the fate of the viruses	1
23403	If negative - sense strands of the RNA viruses can be found , this would suggest virus replication [ 48 , 49 ] .	1
23404	Following the preferred @DISEASE$ method proposed by Ang et al	1
23405	[ 66 , 82 , 83 ] , the various effects of each factor can be quantificationally calculated as :	1
23406	AMR indicators , segregated mainly into process and outcome indicators , were set up in the public hospital surveillance system	1
23407	Some of the process indicators were antimicrobial use for human and animal health , and infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene in hospitals	1
23408	It was suggested that the Singapore government played a prime role in mandating the standardization , transparency , and sharing of data with the @GENE$	1
23409	The motivation of the workforce was attributed to the competition , prestige , and reputation of the workforce	1
23410	In the hospital setting , metrics and outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship such as average defined daily dose and percentage of appropriate antibiotics prescribed , and length of hospitalization for each department are often reported and shared among the various departments within the hospital	1
23411	The transparency of data highly motivated the workforce to perform well in these benchmarking exercises	1
23412	The following quote is an example of such occurrence : " More important I think is the peer pressure and peer standing	1
23413	And when it ' s made the department target and communicated by the head of the department , no one wants to be the worst department in the stats when they are shown up	1
23414	So there ' s lot of department pride and that ' s what drives stuff	1

23421	Data sources , consisting of the gross domestic product including agriculture , production , construction , and service , the population including rural population and urban population , the total energy consumption based on industrial and residential perspective , covering the period from 2003 to 2013 , were all available	1
23422	Economic , population and energy data were collected from the Guangdong Province Statistical Yearbook ( 2003 - 2014 ) and Guangzhou City Statistical Yearbook ( 2003 ) ( 2004 ) ( 2005 ) ( 2006 ) ( 2007 ) ( 2008 ) ( 2009 ) ( 2010 ) ( 2011 ) ( 2012 ) ( 2013 ) ( 2014 )	1
23423	Economic data was measured by GDP in Chinese Yuan in time series	1
23424	Energy data includes physical quantity of total energy consumption by fuel types measured by tons of standard coal equivalent ( tce ) , which were compiled by the Guangdong Province Statistical Bureau and Guangzhou City Statistical Bureau .	1
23425	Differences in amounts of transcytosed or infectious virus between conditions were compared using Kruskal - Wallis or repeated - measures ANCOVA	1
23426	For repeated - measures ANCOVA , the percentage of transcytosed or infectious virus was logittransformed and normality evaluated using the Shapiro - Wilk test .	1
23427	Once control bands were identified , the sample was subjected to further analysis based on the virusspecific size of the amplicon	1
23428	In case of @DISEASE$ A H1N1 09 ( ' swine flu ' ) serotype , in addition to @GENE$ , the presence of the @GENE$ as well as the @GENE$ general signal was required to mark a sample as positive for @GENE$	1

23436	Thus , if a factor comprised five items then individual composite scores for that index could range from 5 to 25 .	1
23437	For comparisons with other methods already in the literature , we choose to use our Iterative HFold method with @GENE$ as input structure , based on its overall good accuracies in Section ' Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold '	1
23438	We compare this method with two of the best - performing methods [ 44 ] for prediction of pseudoknotted structures , namely HotKnots V2	1
23439	0 [ 36 ] , a MFE - based heuristic method , and IPknot [ 42 ] , a method that is based on maximum expected accuracy	1
23440	( Prepared by Puton et al	1
23441	[ 44 ] , @GENE$ , is the website for continuous comparison of RNA secondary structure methods on both PDB data set and RNA strand	1
23442	We chose IPknot because it was the best - performing noncomparative pseudoknot prediction method that can handle @GENE$ RNA sequences , based on the ranking on their website as of March 25 , 2014	1
23443	We also noticed that Puton et al	1

23446	Therefore we chose to include @GENE$ in our comparisons as well	1
23447	Since the focus of this paper is on prediction of pseudoknotted structures , we do not compare our results with that of Co - Fold [ 26 ] or other methods for prediction of pseudoknot free structures	1

23451	However , the superior accuracy of Iterative @GENE$ compared with @GENE$ and @GENE$ is significant	1
23452	For @GENE$ , the difference in accuracy between @GENE$ , Iterative @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ is not significant	1
23453	Table 4 presents the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval for average F - measure for Iterative @GENE$ ( with @GENE$ as input ) , @GENE$ and IPknot ( with default setting ) on the IP - pk168 and DK - pk16 data sets .	1
23454	Comparing accuracy of Iterative HFold and @GENE$ V2	1
23455	0 on HK - PK , HK - PK - free , DK - pk16 and IP - pk168 , we found that the difference in their accuracies is insignificant on HK - PK , HK - PK - free and DK - pk16 data sets when Iterative @GENE$ is provided with @GENE$ as input	1
23456	Based on our results on the HK - PK data set , with only about 15 % information about the true pseudoknot - free structures , Iterative HFold ' s 95 % percentile confidence interval is ( 65	1

23470	molecules Antioxidant and Anti - Inflammatory Activities of Essential Oils : A Short Review	1
23471	Background : Lactate dehydrogenase - elevating virus ( LDV ) is a natural infectious agent of mice	1
23472	Like several other viruses , LDV causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood	1
23473	The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies .	1
23474	Whether these marked differences between alternate model formulations may translate into potentially important public health concerns is a key question , which we address in two ways	1
23475	First , we document systematic differences in the model parameters estimated from an epidemic using the exponential and gamma - distributed models	1
23476	Second , we demonstrate that the use of exponential models produces overoptimistic predictions about the low levels of control required to subdue an epidemic .	1
23477	All NTHi isolates were discriminated from nonhaemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus ( non - haemolytic H	1
23478	haemolyticus ) using molecular techniques [ 13 ] .	1
23479	While several @GENE$ have been shown to regulate @GENE$ ( reviewed in Goo et al	1
23480	, 2015 ) , much less is known about the relevant @GENE$	1
23481	@GENE$ was identified in a focused RNAi screen in C	1
23482	elegans as the first @GENE$ to regulate @GENE$	1
23483	@GENE$ loss - of - function mutants exhibit increased levels of ubiquitinated @GENE$ and decreased levels of @GENE$ at synapses ( Kowalski et al	1
23484	, 2011 )	1
23485	The abundance of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , a @GENE$ which cannot be ubiquitinated , is unaffected in @GENE$ loss - of - function mutants leading to a model where @GENE$ deubiquitinates @GENE$ to regulate its abundance	1
23486	@GENE$ regulation of @GENE$ is physiologically relevant because @GENE$ loss - of - function mutants have reduced cell surface levels of @GENE$ and corresponding defects in @GENE$ behaviors	1
23487	Together with data showing that @GENE$ partially colocalizes with endosomes , Kowalski et al	1
23488	( 2011 ) proposed a model where @GENE$ acts at endosomes to promote @GENE$ stability and recycling to the cell surface	1
23489	Consistent with this model , a recent study showed that @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , which cannot be ubiquitinated , escapes lysosomal degradation and recycles back to the cell surface ( Widagdo et al	1
23490	, 2015 ) .	1
23491	According to the risk assessment results , the average infection risk of all the seventy - one seated passengers increases by 1	1
23492	7 % ~ 2	1
23493	2 % due to human movement	1
23494	So the frequent walking of the crew members or the passengers will raise the infection risk level in the airplane cabin	1
23495	However , a 1	1
23496	7 % ~ 2	1
23497	2 % increase is not so significant	1
23498	By estimating the likelihoods of a series of human movement assumptions , the no movement case has the highest likelihood and is most likely to be the real case	1
23499	This conclusion fits with the estimated results given by a previous study which stated that no human movement is the most probable case [ 18 ]	1
23500	This result does not imply that there is no human movement in the real outbreak case , which is impossible	1
23501	The crew members or the passengers may still walk frequently in the airplane when the index patient is not coughing	1
23502	It needs to be emphasized that although the no movement case is the most likely case in this outbreak case , the conclusion may not be generalized to all outbreak cases because the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are casedependent .	1
23503	The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using the dose - response model in infection risk assessment	1
23504	The average infection risk of the seated passengers is 0	1
23505	2015 , 0	1
23506	2051 and 0	1
23507	2096 for no human movement , moving speeds of 0	1
23508	5 m / s and 1	1
23509	0 m / s , respectively	1
23510	The assessment result shows that human movement may increase the average infection risk in the cabin , especially for the passengers seated three rows ahead and one row behind the index patient	1
23511	The likelihood of each case is estimated and the highest likelihood can be found in the no movement case with a quanta generation rate of 0	1
23512	141 million	1
23513	So in this @DISEASE$ outbreak case , the effect of human movement on airborne disease transmission , as it changes the dispersion and mixing pattern of infectious expiratory aerosol , is found to be very insignificant	1
23514	Since the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are case - dependent , this result may not be generalized to all cases	1
23515	Moreover , if the seated passengers walk in the airplane cabin , the intake doses of that passengers may also significantly increase and lead to a high infection risks	1
23516	So the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the airborne disease transmission in the airplane cabin and may result in significantly higher infection risks for the moving persons .	1

23518	Methods : My understanding is that the exposure analysis refers only to indoor exposure in the residential environment , without considering any time spent outdoors or in other indoor microenvironments ; however , this is not clear in the text	1
23519	Can you please clarify what the building stock represents .	1
23520	Given that resources available for public health spending tend to be scarce , it is important that the risk of an epidemic is not distorted and that credible evidence on the effectiveness of the interventions is used to inform responses and justify spending	1
23521	During the @DISEASE$ outbreak , some of the published literature questioned the evidence on the efficacy of the proposed interventions , quarantine ( Jacobs 2007 ) and travel advisories ( Paquin 2007 )	1
23522	In Brazil , some evidence suggests that the spike in @DISEASE$ cases is not a consequence of the @DISEASE$ , but rather , the result of conditions of poverty , including poor sanitation and exposure to larvicides and insecticides ( Diniz 2016 )	1
23523	This calls into question recommendations to delay pregnancy due to the @DISEASE$	1
23524	As discussed above , the quality of response from global health organizations to the @DISEASE$ outbreak in Liberia remains debatable and questions the evidence used to inform and justify these responses .	1
23525	Based on the literature on the politics of disease epidemics , four key themes emerged : ( 1 ) the socioeconomic distribution of disease , ( 2 ) decision - making in research and development , ( 3 ) the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways , and ( 4 ) the attribution of @DISEASE$ responsibility	1
23526	These were used to analyze the narratives of the politics of SARs , Zika , and Ebola in Canada , Brazil , and Liberia respectively , in the peer - reviewed literature ( Table 5 ) .	1

23607	JEV replicates in porcine nasal mucosa explants	1
23608	As a first step , we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors with both JEV genotype 1 strain Laos and genotype 3 strain Nakayama , in comparison to mock control ( Fig	1
23609	1 )	1
23610	After 48 h postinfection ( hpi ) , @GENE$ was detected in epithelial cells ( Fig	1
23611	1A and B ) , with a more efficient infection found with the Laos strain - challenged tissues	1
23612	An increase in @GENE$ loads from both strains was also detected in porcine nasal mucosa , indicative of virus replication ( Fig	1
23613	1C )	1
23614	@GENE$ showed an increase in expression from 24 hpi on , further increasing at 48 hpi	1
23615	The Nakayama strain displayed a slower @GENE$ increase , with only three out of four positive samples 48 hpi ( Fig	1
23616	1C ) .	1
23617	However , to ensure swine welfare , productivity and reduced mortality associated with @DISEASE$ , alternatives to colistin and other antimicrobials , especially those of critical importance for human health , are essential in pigs	1
23618	There is a major debate over the terminology ' alternative to antibiotics ' because we do not propose substances with antibacterial activity but rather substances that act on bacteria indirectly , either by stimulating the host immune system , by the release of substances that have antibacterial activity or by improving the host gut health and consequently growth performance [ 87 ]	1
23619	Thus , we will use the terminology « strategies » or « measures » to describe alternatives to antimicrobials	1
23620	Due to the multifactorial etiology of @DISEASE$ , finding case - specific preventive measures against this disease is a challenge for both researchers and veterinarians	1
23621	Here we give an overview of these preventive strategies , focusing on the most practical and promising ones for the control of @DISEASE$ in pigs .	1
23622	Genes , whose codon choice is constrained only by a mutation bias , will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values	1
23623	The predicted values of ENC were calculated as	1
23624	Analysis of extracts of callus culture of H	1
23625	littoralis revealed some interesting findings	1
23626	Callus cultures supplemented with growth regulators at various combinations Comparing the amount of lycorine obtained from both wild plant and the callus tissue culture , it can be noticed that callus culture supplemented with appropriate concentrations and combination of growth regulators resulted in production of comparable amount of lycorine	1
23627	This may be due to the effect of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein	1
23628	@GENE$ are known to have effects not only on cell differentiation and proliferation but also on the biosynthesis pathway of the cell [ 22 , 23 ]	1
23629	Therefore , in this study , there may be a probability that the 2 , 4 - D and BAP used in the callus culture could have partly been involved in the biosynthesis of lycorine	1
23630	From the present study , the callus culture may be supplemented with only 4	1
23631	50 M 2 , 4 - D or a combination of 9	1
23632	00 M 2 , 4 - D with 4	1
23633	5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine	1
23634	This study can be further extended to investigate other combinations of @GENE$ that may increase the lycorine content of the callus culture	1
23635	The findings of such study would prove to be useful as there are many benefits of the lycorine to the medical and health sector .	1
23636	Initial studies suggested that @GENE$ in @GENE$ represents a suitable target for the development of @GENE$ [ 62 , [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ]	1
23637	Hence , the idea to develop @GENE$ as a strategy to prevent the entry of MERS - CoV into host cells was led by Du et al	1
23638	[ 75 ]	1
23639	@GENE$ were made by vaccinating mice with @GENE$ to which @GENE$ was fused [ 75 ]	1
23640	Consequently , @GENE$ , the most effective @GENE$ was developed that targeted @GENE$ , and successfully neutralized @DISEASE$ infection in Vero E6 , Huh - 7 and Calu - 3 cells [ 76 ]	1
23641	These studies indicated the potential of h@GENE$ s efficient curative agents against infection caused by MERS - CoV	1
23642	Around April 2014 , three independent studies first reported to have developed complete h@GENE$  77 , 78 ]	1
23643	All these h@GENE$ pecifically targeted the M@GENE$  The efficacy of h@GENE$ gainst @DISEASE$ infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al	1
23644	[ 79 ]	1
23645	They were able to completely treat @DISEASE$ infection of lethal nature with a single dose of hum@GENE$ the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [ 79 ] .	1
23646	293T cells were plated at 80 % - 90 % confluency and either treated with 100 µM , 500 µM , 1000 µM or 2000 µM DFMO for 4 - days or left untreated	1
23647	The @GENE$ were then transfected in the combinations described in the figures , according to the manufacturer ' s protocol , using @GENE$ ( SignaGen Laboratories , Rockville , MD , USA )	1
23648	The transfection was incubated at 37 • C for 24 h .	1
23649	Next , a similar analysis was conducted on primary macrophages undergoing spreading @DISEASE$	1
23650	MDM were infected with replication competent HIV - 1 ( ADA at a multiplicity of infection , MOI , of 0 , 1 )	1
23651	Cells were washed and aliquots of the supernatant were harvested at different days post infection to monitor viral spread by exogenous - RT activity ( Figure 4C ) and cell lysates and virion particles were also harvested at the indicated times post infection	1
23652	The intracellular levels of IFITMs i@GENE$ d over time during spreading @DISEASE$ , in agreement with the upregulation of an IFNdependent tra@GENE$ program described in a number of previous studies ( [ [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] ) , although not all ( [ 37 ] )	1
23653	As expected , when virion particles produced at different days after infection were examined , IFITMs were inco@GENE$ d into HIV - 1 particles proportionally to their intracellular levels of expression	1
23654	Of note , only a limited virus production was observed at day 3 post infection , as expected from the low levels of replication ongoing at this early time point	1
23655	Virus production was however more robust at later time points , so that the intrinsic infectivity of virions produced from MDM at day 6 and 9 could be assessed after a MAGI assay on HeLaP5 cells	1
23656	Under these conditions , virions obtained at day 6 displayed higher infectivity than viruses obtained at day 9 , in agreement with the higher incorporation of IFITMs in the la@GENE$ 	1
23657	When compared to their effect on other viruses , as for example @DISEASE$ , IFITMs@GENE$ y a milder antiviral phenotype against HIV - 1 ex vivo	1
23658	However , this does not preclude an important role of IFITMs@GENE$ ping HIV - 1 quasi - species evolution in vivo , possibly as part of the more complex interf@GENE$ se	1
23659	An increasing number of reports indicate that the susceptibility of HIV - 1 to IFNα c@GENE$ s during the course of the disease in infected patients [ 50 , 51 ] and HIV - 1 strains displaying increased resistance to IFITMs have been selected ex vivo [ 52 ]	1
23660	These results suggest that the evolutionary pressure exerted by IFITMs@GENE$  - 1 is likely not neutral	1
23661	In this respect , it will be of interest to determine whether multiple primary HIV - 1 strains display distinct susceptibilities to IFITMs and whether particular IFITM @GENE$ ypes can be associated to distinct HIV - 1 outcomes , as is the case for @DISEASE$ [ 13 ] .	1

23665	Owing to its central role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways , modulation of @GENE$ activity has been an attractive target of many @GENE$ in order to allow them to exploit the host cell signaling machinery to their benefit	1
23666	We have identified the ability of the @GENE$ of the HEV to inhibit host cell @GENE$ activity	1
23667	However , whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of @DISEASE$ infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects , can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus	1
23668	Nevertheless , the present study confirm@GENE$  NFKB inhibitory property o@GENE$ otein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event .	1
23669	Forty eight hours post - transfection , cells were harvested in phosphate buffer saline and @GENE$ assay was conducted as described elsewhere [ 21 ] .	1
23670	As treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 led to reduced @GENE$ processing , which should also reduce virus infectivity [ 61 ] , we next determined the impact of these DIs on the infectivity of released HIV - 1 virus particles	1
23671	To perform single round infections , we generated @GENE$ ting HEK293T cells that were either incubated with the DIs P22077 or PR - 619 , @GENE$ ntreated	1
23672	VLPs were i@GENE$ ed and subsequently used for single round infections in TZM - bl cells , and infectivity was ascertained by measuring β - galacto@GENE$ Treatment with 15 µM or 20 µM P22077 reduced the infectivity of released VLPs up to @GENE$ old , and 5 - fold , respectively ( Figure 3 )	1
23673	Similarly , the infectivity of VLPs , gene@GENE$  under treatment with 7 µM or 14 µM PR - 619 , was about 4 - or even 10 - fold diminished	1
23674	Thus , VLPs produc@GENE$ der DUB inhibition exhibit loss of specific infectivity , most likely due to impaired Gag process@GENE$ .	1
23675	It has been shown previously that the inhibition of the @GENE$ leads to an accumulation of @GENE$ , which interfere with @GENE$ - processing [ 38 ]	1
23676	Later , it was shown that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV - 1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) [ 64 ]	1
23677	In this study , we could show that the addition of the DIs leads to an accumulation of @GENE$ and a reduction in @GENE$ - processing	1
23678	Thus , we speculated that the combinatory treatment of HLAC with DIs and proteasome inhibitors might synergistically inhibit virus replication	1
23679	Si et al	1
23680	have previously shown that DIs boost the inhibitory effect of @GENE$ inhibitors on Coxsackie virus replication [ 89 ]	1
23681	However , in this case DIs alone had no effect on replication of Coxsackie virus and there was no supra - additive effect detectable , even when both inhibitors were added at high concentrations	1
23682	Possibly , both inhibitors , proteasome inhibitors and DIs , are necessary Viruses 2017 , 9 , 222 16 of 22 to efficiently reduce the pool of free Ub , which has been shown to be necessary to block Coxsackie virus replication [ 89 ]	1
23683	On the contrary , our data illustrate that DIs can enhance the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the inhibition of HIV - 1 replication at very low , supra - effective concentration levels of both inhibitors	1
23684	When applied individually , neither proteasome inhibitors nor DIs had any influence on the HIV - 1 replication at these low concentrations	1
23685	Thus , our results suggest that both inhibitors , DIs and proteasome inhibitors induce synergistic effects , without affecting cell viability .	1
23686	There is no consensus regarding the distribution and type of sialic acids on the epithelia along the chicken oviduct	1
23687	Wang et al	1
23688	[ 19 ] found that the infundibulum was the only section of the oviduct to be lacking sialic acids to which both the lectins @GENE$ amurensis ( @GENE$ ) and the Sambucus nigra ( @GENE$ ) could attach , while in the rest of the oviduct MAA bound abundantly to the epithelium , hence revealing a prevalence of avian - like α - 2 , 3 sialic acids	1
23689	Mork et al	1
23690	[ 50 ] reported a completely different binding profile for the infundibulum , in which both @GENE$ and @GENE$ abundantly attached to the epithelium , while in the rest of the oviduct , they confirmed a significant higher expression of α - 2 , 3 sialic acids binding to both @GENE$ and @GENE$ , a result in keeping with the data by Sid et al	1
23691	[ 42 ]	1
23692	The apparent contradiction of these data likely derives from the different types , brands and concentrations of @GENE$ and revelation methods adopted in the two studies [ 51 , 52 ]	1
23693	To overcome these issues , we opted for an alternative approach , incubating the oviduct histological sections with the labelled H9N2 virus and revealing its attachment by means of immunohistochemistry	1
23694	The results confirmed that this virus has a strong specific preference for the cilia of the infundibulum epithelium , while in the magnum and uterus the virus attaches less than in the infundibulum , and even fails to do so at the level of the isthmus	1
23695	These data , together with the higher incidence and severity of infections observed in the infundibulum , indicate that the high affinity of this virus for the receptors expressed in this section of the oviduct might be one of the main etiological determinants of the disease .	1
23696	Over the past few years , the interest in bat research has increased because of the range of viruses that they harbor and the potential of spillover to humans and other vertebrates [ 1 ]	1
23697	In some instances , there is direct evidence that viruses have spilled over from bats to other vertebrates	1
23698	For example , Nipah virus spilled over from bats to humans and pigs leading to outbreaks in Southeast Asia and @DISEASE$ virus continues to spillover into horses and humans in Australia [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]	1
23699	In other instances , the evidence of virus spillover from bats is circumstantial	1
23700	For example , in case of @DISEASE$ , serological evidence and the detection of viruses related to the @DISEASE$ in bats [ 7 , 8 ] suggests that they are reservoirs of the virus	1
23701	Recent discoveries of filoviruses in bats of China and Sierra Leone have further bolstered this claim [ 9 , 10 ]	1
23702	However , viruses linked to specific @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) epidemics have not yet been detected in bats	1
23703	Although bats harbor many diverse viruses , their spillover to other animals is extremely rare [ 11 ]	1
23704	One of the reasons is that for a spillover event to take place several factors such as pathogen shedding , environmental conditions , pathogen persistence in environment , and recipient host susceptibility , should all be conducive to transmission	1
23705	This would result in the " perfect storm " required for spillover	1
23706	A review by Plowright et al	1
23707	[ 12 ] describes the factors that could lead to such a perfect storm	1
23708	Here , we focus on one of the initial events affecting this spillover , i	1

23715	Method section " @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) study participants	1
23716	Age - dependent distribution of respiratory virus data of our study shows that @DISEASE$ is mostly concentrated in less than one - year age group particularly @DISEASE$ as a substantial threat	1
23717	The frequency of pathogen positive specimens and incidence of coinfections were significantly higher in under - one children , which makes it the most vulnerable age group for @DISEASE$	1
23718	Additionally , around 87 % ( 54 / 62 ) of the @DISEASE$ cases were detected in children less than one year of age	1
23719	The frequency of @DISEASE$ in this age group seems to be a consequence of multifactorial complex events , involving especially immunological fact@GENE$ odies are a vital means of protection to infants against @DISEASE$ as they have a relatively immature immune system to mount an effective immune response	1
23720	@DIS@GENE$ s are found in all adults and children older than three years of age	1
23721	At one year of age , 25 - 50 % of children have antibodies against RSV , indicating the high frequency of this infection at a young age [ 52 ] and then the incidence of @DISEASE$ decreases with age , probably because of the development of anti - RSV immunity which is boosted during each subsequent re - infection [ 53 ]	1
23722	Currently , there are no effective antivirals or vaccines against @DISEASE$	1
23723	Several @DISEASE$ vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials and have yet to be licensed [ 54 ] .	1
23724	The unique features of bat immune responses that promote viral persistence may exert evolutionary pressures on the virus as well	1
23725	Bats have superseded rodents in harboring greater number of viruses and also having greater proportion of zoonotic viruses [ 63 ]	1
23726	It is therefore crucial to understand how evolutionary pressure may have a role in the emergence of new viral strains	1
23727	A recent study found that @GENE$ are best adapted to pteropid bats [ 64 ]	1
23728	Adaptation of genomes refers to better capability of the virus to use host cellular machinery for its replication and protein synthesis , which is usually governed by natural selection ; diversity in codon usage bias may contribute to it	1
23729	Codon usage is an interspecies bias where one codon is selected over other synonymous codons in a particular species [ 65 ]	1
23730	Natural selection for viral variants works by selecting codons matching host tRNA abundance	1
23731	It also selects for variants with the advantage of not activating @GENE$ , such as those for @GENE$	1
23732	Codon bias analysis suggested that henipaviruses have the highest level of adaptation to pteropid bats	1
23733	It would be interesting to study whether other viruses also show such codon bias towards their reservoir hosts	1
23734	We might be able to use such codon bias studies in the future to identify reservoir hosts of spilled over viruses	1
23735	Due to coevolution with the reservoir host , the viruses would have a codon bias specific towards their reservoir host	1
23736	Apart from codon bias , natural selection based on receptor utilization also has a role to play in the evolution of viruses	1
23737	Variation in the efficiency of bat coronaviruses to recognize @GENE$ show that the @GENE$ evolved in a stepwise manner to infect human cells [ 66 ]	1
23738	Despite several other receptor - binding studies [ 67 , 68 ] , the mechanism of adaptation to new hosts is not definitively understood .	1
23739	Sequences (	1
23740	HEK293T cells were cotransfected with @GENE$ ( 3 µg ) and @GENE$ ( 2 µg )	1
23741	After 48 - h incubation , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized with 0	1
23742	1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min	1
23743	The cells were then incubated with an @GENE$ ( 1 : 100 ) ( catalog no	1
23744	C3956 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) or @GENE$ ( 1 : 100 ) ( catalog no	1
23745	F1804 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h .	1
23746	The study used a qualitative , exploratory , and descriptive design to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for @DISEASE$ patients at regional hospital	1
23747	The researcher wanted to uncover the personal experiences of nurses and the meanings that they attached to the events , processes , and structures of their lives in the @DISEASE$ wards	1
23748	Therefore , an exploratory and descriptive design was the most suitable design .	1
23749	In conclusion , the present study reported the circulating HAdV types and their prevalence in paediatric patients with @DISEASE$ in China	1
23750	HAdV was frequently ( 76 / 552 , 13	1
23751	77 % ) detected , and HAdV - B and HAdV - C were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China , respectively	1
23752	However , we only amplified relati@GENE$ nces rather than@GENE$ gi@GENE$  HVR ) , perhaps resulting in the loss of the recombinant and variant information	1
23753	More extensive studies will be needed to address the prevalence and geographic distribution of dominant genotypes of HAdV using well - matched control groups and sequential samples collected over a longer time	1
23754	Finally , to the best of our knowledge , HAdV - 37 ( KM378014 ) and HAdV - 57 ( KM377992 ) are the first strains of these genotypes to be reported in inpatient children with @DISEASE$ .	1
23755	Sequence analysis of historical and @GENE$ of influenza H1N1 reveal a great deal about the history of the virus	1
23756	The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago , and there has been universal extinction of all earlier human @DISEASE$ strains	1
23757	The rate of mutational divergence from that original genotype has been very constant both in human and porcine H1N1 strains ( roughly 14 - 16 mutations fixed per year )	1
23758	Modern H1N1 strains have diverged from the original genotype by roughly 1 , 900 fixations ( more than 15 % of the genome has mutated )	1
23759	Roughly 7 % of the amino acids have mutated	1
23760	Mutation accumulation is also associated with the historical exponential decline in @DISEASE$ , which may suggest significant genetic attenuation , as might arise due to very slow error catastrophe .	1
23761	Additional file 3 : @GENE$ genomic variation data , in	1
23762	csv format .	1
23763	Similar to @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) virus began causing sporadic self - limited outbreaks in late 2002 , after which it seemingly developed sustained human - to - human transmission , and spread internationally	1
23764	12 Post - epidemic studies of @DISEASE$ have revealed a lowlevel circulation of the virus several months before it was first detected in humans in Guangdong Province of China , suggesting a period of time in which the virus adapted to human hosts	1
23765	13 While it is difficult to draw direct comparisons , it seems possible that MERS - CoV is demonstrating a similar transmission pattern , reflected by the sporadic outbreaks occurring in 2012 , followed by sustained low - level transmission in 2013 , and now showing a larger human infection KSA wave in 2014 ( Figure 1 )	1
23766	4 If the epidemiologic model of SARS is relevant to @DISEASE$ , 13 this current progression in MERS - CoV ecology may presage much greater future @DISEASE$ epidemics .	1
23767	We report the rare finding of @GENE$ reactivation in a child with confirmed @DISEASE$	1
23768	Although BCG reac@GENE$ tion is known to be an extremely important and highly specific clinical manifestation of @DISEASE$ , this case suggests that B@GENE$ eactivation may also occur in other childhood diseases or infections	1
23769	A thorough search for an infective aetiological agent may be indicated in children presenting with this clinical finding .	1
23770	Here , we aimed to address how HCV expression causes @DISEASE$ and to provide new options for HCV vaccine development	1
23771	Using LC16m8 , a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus ( VV ) , we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses ( rVVs ) that each encoded one of three different HCV proteins @GENE$ t one recombinant virus ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded nonstructural@GENE$ thological @DISEASE$ symptoms in the liver	1
23772	We also found that immunization with rVV - N25 suppressed HC@GENE$ tein levels@GENE$  transgenic mice ; moreover , this suppression was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells , a@GENE$ s been previously reported [ 8 ] .	1
23773	Laboratory investigations revealed a mild @DISEASE$ ( haemoglobin 10	1

23775	5 X 10 9 cells / L ) and platelet counts ( 252 X 10 9 / L )	1
23776	Both th@GENE$ n ( < 6 mg / dL ) and the erythrocyte sedimentary rate ( 10 mm / hour ) were normal	1
23777	Other investigations including liver function tests @GENE$ n 42 g / L @GENE$ e 41 U / L @GENE$ e 17 U / L ) and urine microscopy were also normal	1
23778	Blood for bacterial culture was negative	1

23781	We used the second half of the data from November 1st , 2003 onwards and added outbreakrelated counts to test for the detection of an outbreak signature .	1

23783	Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [ 55 ]	1
23784	Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [ 56 ]	1
23785	Gerow et al	1
23786	[ 57 ] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation , leading to detection of the virus in blood	1
23787	This reactivation was also associated with a low level of @GENE$ against the virus	1
23788	Following hibernation the antibody levels increase , which subsequently drives the virus into latency .	1
23789	The @GENE$ can be used to assign functions to a file of protein sequences	1

23795	The Servers and the Services The four servers described here , collectively referred to as the @GENE$ servers , currently support 181 methods that can be invoked to extract data and services ( Fig	1
23796	1 )	1
23797	The server code resides at the location of the @GENE$	1
23798	Users download a distribution with their choice of runtime environment that they may use to write programs to access @GENE$ data or perform a number of common bioinformatics tasks using a supplied set of preprogrammed scripts	1
23799	Currently , Perl and Java integrations are supported	1
23800	The following subsections describe the four servers in more detail .	1
23801	The Metabolic Modeling and Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) Server provides programmatic remote access to the Model SEED biochemistry and genome - scale metabolic model database , as well as some model analysis algorithms	1
23802	The Model SEED biochemistry database integrates into a single , nonredundant set all the reactions and compounds found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) database [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] , together with additional curated reactions and compounds [ 18 ] , and a continuously growing number of published genome - scale metabolic models .	1
23803	We retrospectively revised all the files of children aged 0 - 14 years who were visited for @DISEASE$ from 1 January to 31 December 2016 in the Pediatric ED of S	1
23804	Orsola - Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna , Italy	1
23805	All the patients with a diagnosis of " @DISEASE$ , " " @DISEASE$ , " and " @DISEASE$ " were included	1
23806	Our center is an urban , academic , tertiary care Pediatric Emergency Unit , consisting of a Pediatric ED with approximately 23000 visits per year of children aged 0 - 14 , a shortstay observation with 6 beds , and a ward with 28 beds	1
23807	Patients arriving at the ED are registered by a triage - qualified nurse and seen first by pediatric residents and the attending physician	1
23808	Two more nurses are available for the ED patients and 1 for the short - stay observation .	1
23809	@GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ are candidate regulators of the @GENE$ The genes within the peak linkage regions were subsequently analyzed for known biological functions ( GeneCards ) ( Safran et al	1
23810	2010 ) and expression in lung tissue [ Fantom5 ( Forrest et al	1
23811	2014 ; Severin et al	1
23812	2014 ) ; Table 3 ]	1
23813	The @GENE$ contained nine genes , with five of these ( @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ) expressed in adult lung ( Table 3 )	1
23814	Both @GENE$ and @GENE$ have known functions that could implicate them in regulating gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium network	1
23815	@GENE$ , a @GENE$ of the @GENE$ involved in vesicular trafficking , also exerts downstream transcriptional effects by antagonizing the action of the @GENE$ ( Sun et al	1
23816	2012 )	1
23817	However , the function , localization , and mechanisms of action of @GENE$ are still largely undefined	1
23818	On the other hand , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) is a @GENE$ es transcription by regulating protein subnuclear localization ( Karvonen et al	1
23819	2008 ) .	1
23820	To further define transcriptional programs that might specify pulmonary myocardium identity , we performed @GENE$ binding site enrichment analysis	1
23821	We used the oPOSSUM - 3 Web - based tool ( Kwon et al	1
23822	2012 ) to identify overrepresented , conserved @GENE$ in our set of 21 @GENE$ and five @GENE$	1
23823	The @GENE$ was enriched in @GENE$ for @GENE$ ( @GENE$ 	1
23824	Unfortunately , in our study we did not test the ovaries for virological and histopathological analyses , hence we missed important information that might have completed the pathogenetic picture	1
23825	For this reason , we should not exclude that the drop in egg production , in particular during the acute phase of the disease , could have also been caused by a @DISEASE$ .	1
23826	Throughout the entire oviduct , the outer serosa was specifically and abundantly positive .	1
23827	Until now , the role of the vast variety of DUBs in the replication cycle of viruses is poorly understood , although there is an increasing evidence that besides @DISEASE$ also other virus families evolved strategies to hijack the UPS in order to accomplish their own replication successfully	1
23828	For Taken together , these results indicate that DIs , especially those targ@GENE$  USP@GENE$ USP47 , not only inhibit HIV - 1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus ent@GENE$ f Gag int@GENE$ C - I pathway .	1
23829	Because we found that HCV protein reduction in the liver required CD8 T cells , we tested whether HCV - specific CD8 T cells were present in splenocytes 28 days after immunization	1
23830	To determine the functional reactivity of HCV - specific CD8 + T cells , we performed a CD107a mobilization assay and intracellular @GENE$ staining	1
23831	CN2 - 29 transgenic mice expressed the @GENE$ and the @GENE$	1
23832	However , rVV - N25 comprised only Isolated splenocytes from immunized mice were co - cultured with EL - 4CN2 or EL - 4NS2 cell lines for 2 weeks and analyzed .	1
23833	Inhibitors of @GENE$ Block HIV - 1 Replication and Augment the Presentation of @GENE$ 	1
23834	Further studies need to elucidate gaps in knowledge on this infection in cats and to provide evidence - based information on the management of this disease .	1
23835	Allopurinol is generally well tolerated ; however , in one cat , elevation of @GENE$ was reported at 10 mg / kg BID and the dose was reduced to 5 mg / kg BID [ 56 ]	1
23836	Clinical improvement was observed in most cases treated with allopurinoleven in FIV positive cats - within a few weeks after treatment was initated [ 37 , 50 , 64 ] or slowly after 6 months [ 56 ]	1
23837	A long term follow - up was available in some cats treated with allopurinol	1
23838	A clinical cure was obtained in these cats but relapse occurred after discontinuation of treatment , suggesting that they were still infected [ 14 , 37 , 55 ]	1
23839	Clinical worsening leading to euthanasia occurred in a few cases after a few weeks of therapy [ 54 , 57 ] .	1
23840	To determine whether viral replication and production also is elevated at other phases of the cell cycle , the effect of S phase synchronization was assessed	1
23841	The cells were cultured in medium or were synchronized in S phase by culture with 0	1
23842	85 mM thymidine for 24 h	1
23843	Then , the cells were mock infected or were infected with 0	1
23844	8 MOI of EV - D68 for 2 h , and fresh culture medium or 0	1
23845	85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1E )	1
23846	Thymidine induced obvious S phase arrest ( P < 0	1
23847	001 ; Figure 1F )	1
23848	The @GENE$ level remained similar in S phase - synchronized cells and control non - synchronized cells at 2 h post - infection ( Figure 1M ) and at 24 h post - infection ( P > 0	1
23849	05 ; Figure 1G )	1
23850	Furthermore , the TCID50 / mL values at 24 h post - infection were equivalent for the S phase - synchronized cell supernatant ( 2	1
23851	59 ± 1	1
23852	37 × 10 5 ) and the control cell supernatant ( 3	1
23853	28 ± 1	1
23854	80 × 10 5 ) ( P > 0	1
23855	05 ; Figure 1H )	1
23856	These results suggest that S - phase arrest does not affect EV - D68 viral entry , replication or production .	1
23857	The interest in coronaviruses was reignited after the 2002 outbreak of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) and 2012 outbreak of @DISEASE$	1
23858	Researchers have tried to understand pandemic potential of MERS - CoV by studying its emergence and ecology	1
23859	Studies are being carrying out to assess how this virus causes disease so that novel therapeutics and vaccines can be developed	1
23860	The mode of transmission of @DISEASE$ is yet to be established , but it is assumed to have come from bats [ 13 ]	1
23861	Camels found in the Arabian Peninsula may serve as intermediate hosts for human infection [ 14 ]	1
23862	This review will focus on studies trying to elucidate mechanisms by which MERS - CoV escapes host - immune system and causes disease	1
23863	We will also examine the recent advances in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines	1
23864	Figure 1 vitro studies	1
23865	Studies were conducted on animal models and human lung cell lines , and the account from a single autopsy [ 43 ]	1
23866	In vitro studies revealed that MERS - CoV can easily replicate in several cultured human cells , as well as , in the differentiated and nondifferentiated human epithelial cells [ 34 , 44 ]	1
23867	The antigens of MERS - CoV were found on th@GENE$ ages in the alveoli of the infected human lung explants , ciliated and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells , endothelial cells and pneumocytes [ 33 , 45 ]	1
23868	These findings were in sync with the findings made in the single autopsy where MERS - CoV antigen was detected on pneu@GENE$ al cells and epithelial cells of the airways and few on macrophages [ 43 , 45 ]	1
23869	Macrophages are the important phagocytic cells of innate immune system which help remove the pathogenic substances from the body and present their antigens to the T cells	1
23870	The cytokines as well as chemokines produce@GENE$ acrophages @GENE$ troying the pathogens , adjusting the immune system and maintaining tissue homoeostasis [ 46 ]	1
23871	However , in @DISEASE$ , the virus - infected macrophages contribute considerably to the development of disease symptoms [ 47 ]	1
23872	The infection with @DISEASE$ of human epithelial cells induce the release of pro - inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from the monocyte - derived macrophages	1
23873	It is believed that these chemokines / cytokines cause inflammatory changes and tissue injury through infiltration of immune cells in the lower respiratory tract [ 47 ]	1
23874	The patients suffering from MERS clinically manifest pneumonia , which is progressive in nature and has a large number of macrophages and neutrophils found in the fluids present in the lungs [ 3 , 48 ]	1
23875	Studies conducted on rhesus macaques have shown the lung tissue infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils on MERS - CoV infection , though their respiratory symptoms were milder as compared with humans [ 49 ]	1
23876	Many scientists believe that this sequestration of immune cells contribute to the development of lymphopenia seen in patients with MERS	1
23877	The progress in the severity of pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in the MERS patients is also attributed to cytokine / chemokine induction [ 30 , 50 ]	1
23878	Zhou et al	1
23879	found that MERS - CoV can efficiently replicate inside macrophages and , hence , can overcome the host immune system	1
23880	[ 47 ]	1
23881	Thus , these phagocytes act like reservoirs and means of transportation for these viruses , helping to replicate and disseminate , such as the HIV virus [ 51 ] .	1
23882	After data organization and analysis , six major themes were developed from the findings of this study and sub - themes were also formulated ( see Table 1 )	1
23883	Participants shared the same experiences with regards to caring for @DISEASE$ patients at Tshilidzini Hospital .	1
23884	Nurse ( N2 ) added that : " There is a high @DISEASE$ prevalence in surrounding rural areas	1
23885	Some of them default because they go to traditional healers and the healers tell them that they have been bewitched ; they are not really sick	1
23886	When those patients come back to the hospital their condition will be bad and most of them do not survive a week	1
23887	Some patients continue to smoke and drink alcohol and worsen their conditions as they fail to adhere to their treatment	1
23888	"	1
23889	In the work presented here we describe a novel feature related to the biology of @GENE$ , namely their ability to be Figure 6 @GENE$ incorporation into HIV - 1 viral particles affects viral infectivity by interfering with entry of the virus in target cells	1
23890	Normalized @GENE$ bearing HIV - 1 virions produced in the presence or absence of @GENE$ were bound to HeLaP4 cells at 4 ° C prior to extensive cell washing	1
23891	The temperature was then raised at 37 ° C to induce entry	1
23892	The extent of entry was then measured according to the two assays schematically depicted in A	1
23893	B ) Two hours after entry , cells were extensively washed , treated with @GENE$ to remove external virion particles and then lysed	1
23894	The amount of @GENE$ was measured by ELISA	1
23895	C ) After exo - RT normalization , equal amounts of viruses incorporating @GENE$ were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells for 2 hours	1
23896	Cells were then incubated with the fluorescent dye CCF2 prior to FACS analysis	1
23897	Graphs present averages obtained from 3 to 8 independent experiments	1
23898	* p ≤ 0 , 05 , according to a Student t test .	1
23899	@DISEASE$ is the leading cause of death in children < 5 years worldwide , which is responsible for one million deaths each year [ 1 ]	1
23900	The burden is greatest in developing countries , at an estimated 0	1
23901	22 episodes per child - year , but remains a major public health concern even among developed countries where there are an estimated 0	1
23902	015 episodes per child - year [ 2 ]	1
23903	In the USA , @DISEASE$ is the second only to newborn infant births as the most common reason for hospital admissions ( 36 cases per 10 000 persons [ 3 ] ) and causes nearly 50 000 deaths each year [ 4 ] .	1
23904	Cat owners were required to be at least 18 years of age , be the primary caregiver of the cat , be able to monitor the frequency of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ , and be able to report the daily occurrences via a daily automated phone call from an Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS )	1
23905	Cats from multi - cat households ( up to four cats maximum ) could be included , but only one cat was eligible to participate in the study and all cats in the house - hold were required to be fed the same study diet	1
23906	Additionally , the owner had to be able to monitor the frequency and occurrence of @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ from the cat participating in the study .	1
23907	Virus ( M133 ) - , myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) and myelin basic protein ( MBP ) - specific CD4 T cells were detected by Enzyme - Linked ImmunoSPOT ( ELISPOT ) assay as described ( 13 )	1
23908	Briefly , 96 - well plates were coated with @GENE$ ( BD Biosciences )	1
23909	Serial dilutions of cells were cultured for 36 h at 37 ° C in RPMI complete ( RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 - mM l - glutamine , non - essential amino acid , 1 - mM sodium pyruvate , 25 - μg / ml gentamycine , and 5 × 10 − 5 M 2 - mercaptoethanol ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum in the presence of stimulator splenocytes preincubated with or without 1 - μM peptide ( M 133 − 147 , GTVYVRPIIEDYHT ; MOG 35 − 55 , MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK ; @GENE$ 60 − 80 , SHHAARTTHYGSLPQKSQR ; Bio - Synthesis , Lewisville , TX , USA )	1

23914	Spots detected in wells with no peptide ( negative control ) were subtracted from spots formed in the presence of peptide and results presented as the number of IFN - γ secreting cells normalized to 10 6 input cells .	1
23915	@DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , also known as @DISEASE$ , is the leading cause of acquired @DISEASE$ in children [ 1 ]	1
23916	Diagnosis is purely clinical , as there are no adequately specific or sensitive tests available	1
23917	The ' classic ' diagnosis involves five days of @DISEASE$ and having four of the five following criteria : @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and a solitary inflamed lymph node mass [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]	1
23918	If left untreated , roughly one - quarter of the children meeting clinical criteria will go on to have @DISEASE$ , including @DISEASE$	1
23919	Incomplete cases , those which do not fulfill four of five of the classic criteria , have similar risk of @DISEASE$ [ 6 ]	1
23920	Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) reduces the rates of @DISEASE$ , with a minority seemingly resistant to treatment [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]	1
23921	Although most @DISEASE$ resolve , some defects are retained	1
23922	Initial studies done on adults with a history of @DISEASE$ implies there is a greater lifetime risk of @DISEASE$ and early mortality [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]	1
23923	To add to the diagnostic confusion , several infectious etiologies have also been independently associated with @DISEASE$ [ 15 ]	1
23924	It remains a frustrating diagnosis because of the unknown etiology , clinical variability , lack of specific testing , and unclear pathogenesis .	1
23925	• On page 8 it is stated that " Traditional risk assessment methods estimate these [ mortality and morbidity ] separately as numbers of cases "	1
23926	I don ' t really agree with this statement	1
23927	There are many health impact assessment methods which can consider both together and which are not incidence - based .	1
23928	• I do not understand why the source control scenario ( scenario 3 ) did not also include an element of ventilation optimization	1
23929	The start of the section describing the scenarios suggests that ventilation optimization would be " complemented " first by filtration and then by source control ( page 9 )	1
23930	This suggests that a ventilation optimization component would appear in all scenarios	1
23931	Choosing just one " optimal " ventilation rate makes it difficult to ascertain the relative benefits due to ventilation and source control .	1
23932	Culture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid was performed in the microbiology laboratory of the @DISEASE$ using standard culture methods	1
23933	Blood samples were taken on admission for all patients and blood cultures were performed using the BD BACTECH 9050 blood culture system	1
23934	S	1
23935	suis was identified on the basis of colony morphology , neg@GENE$ alase reaction , optochin resistance , and by APIStrep ( Biomerieux , France ) and subsequently serotyped ( Statens Serum Institute , Denmark ) .	1
23936	Inclusion criteria for cases of @DISEASE$ were ( i ) clinical signs typical of @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ and / or @DISEASE$ ) and a positive confirmatory @GENE$  ( faecal CPV antigen test or PCR ) or ( ii ) clinical signs typical of @DISEASE$ in a cat from a shelter with a confirmed contemporaneous outbreak of @DISEASE$ .	1
23937	Construction of the @GENE$ A consensus sequence of @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was generated using @GENE$ from various ZIKV isolated between the years of 1952 and 2015 , which caused infection in humans	1
23938	The @GENE$ was cloned into the @GENE$ vector after additional modifications and optimisations were made to improve its in vivo expression including the addition of a @GENE$ ( Figure 1a )	1
23939	Optimal alignment of @GENE$ was performed using homology models and visualisation on Discovery Studio 4	1
23940	5	1
23941	Reference models included PDB 5JHM and PDB 5IZ7	1
23942	Aligned residues corresponding to specific regions on the @GENE$ were labelled in the models for visualisation purposes ( Figure 1b )	1
23943	The optimised consensus vaccine selections are , in general , conservative or semi - conservative relative to multiple @DISEASE$ strains analysed in this study	1
23944	Structural studie@GENE$ dies have revealed that these recognition determinants can be found @GENE$ site at@GENE$ face , which includes the exposed main chain of@GENE$ loop and two conserved glycan chains ( N67 - and N153linked glycans )	1
23945	15 These@GENE$ ites are not highly conserved in other flaviviruses	1
23946	Moreover , ZIKV does not possess@GENE$ site , and@GENE$ site ( equivalent to@GENE$ site in dengue ) is absent in some of the isolated @DISEASE$ strains	1
23947	As part of the consensus design , we therefore designed the construct leaving@GENE$ tion site	1
23948	Lack of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved b@GENE$ nt@GENE$ s ( b@GENE$ v protein	1
23949	15 Subsequent to construction , expressi@GENE$ E protein@GENE$ e plasmid was confirmed by western blot analysis and an indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA )	1
23950	The protein extracts prepared from the cells transiently transfected with ZIKV - prME were analysed for expression by western blot using a panflavivirus antibody ( Figure 1c ) and sera collected from ZIKV - prME immunised mice ( Figure 1d )	1
23951	ZIKV - prME expression was further detected by IFA by the staining of 293T cells transfected Figure 1	1

23955	Codon - optimised synthetic genes of the prME construct included a synthetic IgE leader sequence	1
23956	The optimised gene construct was inserted into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of a modified pVax1 vector under the control of the CMV promoter	1
23957	( b ) Model building of the ZIKV - E proteins demonstrates overlap of the vaccine target with potentially relevant epitope regions	1
23958	Several changes made for vaccine design purpose are located in domains II and III ( located within dashed lines of inset , middle left )	1

23972	Perhaps the most universal finding of this systematic review is the role of social and economic inequality , including poverty during an epidemic	1
23973	Regardless of the national income setting , minority and marginalized communities are the most devastated by an epidemic	1
23974	If organizations and governments are to adequately respond to these individuals and communities , it is critical that narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic - specifically poor communities - are represented in the mainstream media as well as in the peer reviewed published literature - especially , the epidemiological and medical literature that tends to influence health programming and policy - making .	1
23975	Forty ng of @GENE$ per reaction were used in the real time PCR using the ABI Prism ® 7900HT Sequence Detection System ( Foster City , CA )	1
23976	In the presence of @GENE$ ( ABI Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) , the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50 ° C followed by 10 min at 95 ° C	1
23977	Then the reaction was run for 40 cycles at 15 s , 95 ° C and 1 min , 60 ° C per cycle ( Table 1 )	1
23978	Assays - on - Demand [UNK] primers and probes specific for the @GENE$ ( Applied Biosystems ; ID number Hs00168573 - m1 ) were used in the PCR	1
23979	@GENE$ was measured and used to normalize all samples using the ΔΔCT method ( Applied Biosystems )	1
23980	Gene expression of @GENE$ is expressed relative to @GENE$ and untreated samples in each stimulation study , respectively	1
23981	At least three replicates were run for each condition .	1
23982	Porcine attaching and effacing E	1
23983	coli ( @DISEASE$ ) induce @DISEASE$ similar to those produced by enteropathogenic E	1
23984	coli ( EPEC ) in humans , and this pathotype is found in pigs with @DISEASE$ [ 40 ]	1
23985	These E	1
23986	coli carry th@GENE$ e encoding @GENE$ n @GENE$ n ) which is responsible for intimate attachment to epithelial cells	1
23987	However , the pathogenic significance of porcine @DISEASE$ positive isolates in weaned pigs is still unknown [ 2 ]	1
23988	Furthermore , identification of porcine EPEC is difficult and many veterinary diagnostic laboratories do not routinely screen for this pathotype of E	1
23989	coli , isolates of which do not usually possess any of virulence factors of classic @DISEASE$ or @DISEASE$ strains [ 40 ] .	1
23990	In order to investigate the extent of codon usage bias in @DISEASE$ , all RSCU values of different codon in 48 @DISEASE$ strains were calculated	1
23991	There is only two preferred codons@GENE$ Leu ) and GUG ( Val ) , choosing G at the third position , and most of preferred codons are ended with A ( Table 3 )	1
23992	The values of ENC among these poliov@GENE$ milar , which vary from 52	1

23999	The data showed that the extent of codon preference in poliov@GENE$ pt basically stable .	1
24000	Recently , studies on the aerodynamic effects of human movement have received more and more attentions [ 9 ]	1
24001	Significant works have been done on this issue , as summarized in Table 1	1
24002	In experimental investigations , Matsumoto and Ohba [ 10 ] , Poussou et al	1
24003	[ 11 ] and Bjørn and Nielsen [ 12 ] showed that human movement inside enclosed environments could significantly influence contaminant transport and personal exposures to contaminants	1
24004	By using Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) methods , more studies were performed in different indoor environments	1
24005	Simple human models [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and realistic walking human models [ 16 , 17 ] were used as the walking humans in the simulations	1
24006	Most of these studies [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 ] used tracer gas as the contaminant , but gaseous contaminants were not accurate enough to represent the transmission of respiration droplets	1
24007	Wang and Chow [ 17 ] and Choi and Edwards [ 15 , 16 ] studied the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in indoor environment	1
24008	Among previous literatures , significant differences can be found in their methods and conclusions .	1
24009	Reduces the selection pressure Development of other adherence mechanisms high post - weaning feed intakes and minimize duration of @DISEASE$ and consequently @DISEASE$	1
24010	It has been reported that the presence of some ingredients in the feed for weaners , such as soybeans , seems to favor the occurrence of @DISEASE$ [ 92 ]	1
24011	This could be due to the presence of trypsin inhibitor@GENE$ igens inducing a localized immune response [ 2 ]	1
24012	Furthermore , it was shown that soya bean meal ( SBM ) reduced duodenal specific activities of most intestinal enzyme@GENE$ pt depth in pigs [ 93 ]	1
24013	Thus , such ingredients should be avoided in feed of early - weaned pigs	1
24014	In addition , feeds with decreased protein content and the addition of organic acid to reduce gastric pH were found to decrease E	1
24015	coli colonization and to minimize @DISEASE$ prevalence [ 31 ]	1
24016	The scientific community increasingly recognizes the importance of communication and awareness among farmers in relation to antimicrobial resistance , as reflected by the growing number of publications in this area in recent years [ 18 , 94 ]	1
24017	This suggests that farmers ' perceptions , and the factors affecting their behaviour , need to be better understood if effective measures associated responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials are to be implemented successfully .	1
24018	Sequencing Center	1
24019	Sequencing was performed as described previously [ 17 , 18 ]	1
24020	For all samples sequenced by Illumina ( pairedend read technology ) , @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) , generated by combining @GENE$ with long sequencing reads , was used to reduce sequencing errors and improve rare variant detection accuracy	1
24021	Quality filtering procedure was also described in [ 17 , 18 ] .	1
24022	Iterative HFold also has lower rate of accuracy deterioration than HFold with loss of information about the true pseudoknot - free structure , so it is more robust than HFold	1
24023	This is particularly helpful when the given input structure may be unreliable and / or limited information about the true pseudoknot - free structure is available	1
24024	Iterative HFold is also more accurate than @GENE$ [ 47 ] on the test set of Hajdin et al	1
24025	[ 47 ] .	1
24026	As already reported above , there are researchers that prefer to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oils through their ability to scavenge free radicals	1
24027	There are several free radicals that can be used ; nevertheless the fundamental principles involved may be the same	1
24028	This method relies on the reduction of the blue - green cation radical of ABTS + • , by measuring the reduction of the radical cation as the percentage of inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm	1
24029	The absorbance of the reaction mixture of ABTS and an antioxidant is compared to that of the Trolox ® standard , and the results are expressed in terms of Trolox ® equivalent antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) [ 59 ] .	1
24030	@GENE$ - specific dsRNA ( ~ 400 nt ) were prepared using the @GENE$ RNAi kit according to the manufacturer ' s protocol	1
24031	@GENE$ were transfected into Hsu cells using Cellfectin according to a previously described protocol [ 7 ]	1
24032	@GENE$ against @GENE$ ( @GENE$ ) was used as a knock - down specificity control .	1
24033	The Rancimat method is an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids ( formic acid ) produced during the auto - oxidation of lipids at 100 ºC or above [ 5 ]	1
24034	The antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet that was evaluated through the TBARS method [ 52 ] was also evaluated through the Rancimat method in which the lipid substrate was lard	1
24035	The system was heated at 120 ºC and an air flow of 20 L / h was constantly blown into the mixture	1
24036	The end of the induction period was characterized by the sudden increase of water conductivity , due to the dissociation of volatile carboxylic acids	1
24037	Their results showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare L	1
24038	showed the best antioxidant activity index , as determined by the Rancimat method , but less than the activity of BHT ( synthetic standard )	1
24039	Carvacrol was the main component of the Origanum vulgare oil	1
24040	In this case , an oil rich in phenolic components ( oregano ) and the other one ( thyme ) without great levels of these components presented similar activities , in contrast to that reported for the TBARS , in which thyme possessed the best activity [ 52 ]	1
24041	This is a good example in which diverse methods of antioxidant evaluation may give rise different results , showing therefore the importance of using several methods to evaluate the enatioxidant activity of samples .	1
24042	A number of studies have also been performed to identify differentially regulated genes during @DISEASE$ infection in mammalian cells [ 31 , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ]	1
24043	Transcriptome studies using genome - wide microarrays or next - generation deep sequencing of the transcriptome , as well as genome - wide siRNA studies , have revealed a number of pathways to be important during infection process [ 25 , 31 ]	1
24044	These include immune pathways , apoptotic pathways , c@GENE$  proteasomal pathways among others	1
24045	Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using C@GENE$ n mosquito midguts	1
24046	E	1
24047	Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using W@GENE$ n mosquito midguts	1
24048	For all real - time RT - qPCR experiments , R@GENE$ rimers were used as an internal control	1
24049	For plotting , the mean for controls was arbitrarily set at 1 ( median shown ) and fold - change was calculated for each sample ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0	1
24050	005 , comparing between control and Cul4 - knock - down mosquitoes )	1
24051	F	1
24052	Viral titer estimation conducted by plaque assay in mosquito saliva mixed with cell culture medium	1
24053	Viral titers from individual saliva samples were plotted on the graph ( Student ' s t - test * p < 0	1
24054	005 , comparing between control and Cul4 - knock - down mosquitoes )	1
24055	Control ( G@GENE$ sRNA ) N = 17 ; C@GENE$ sRNA N = 17	1
24056	Previous studies using microarray analyses to characterize the transcriptional response of mosquitoes to @DISEASE$ infection have shown that a multitude of pathways appear to be involved , including the immune , cell - cycle / apoptosis , metabolic and proteasomal pathways as well as other cellular processes such as the transport machinery [ 10 , 11 ]	1
24057	Here we adopted an unbiased approach using high - throughput deep sequencing of the mosquito cell transcriptome during a synchronized ( high multiplicity ) infection with @DISEASE$	1
24058	Our data also identified differentially regulated genes from a number of cellular pathways of which we selected ubiquitinproteasomal pathway for further functional analysis .	1
24059	Greater than 90 % of North American @DISEASE$ cases occur in wildlife [ 7 , 9 ] , and striped skunks ( @DISEASE$ ) serve as the most frequent source of @DISEASE$ cases in California [ 10 ]	1
24060	@DISEASE$ in striped skunks was first documented in California in 1899 and @DISEASE$ has been considered enzootic since the 1950s [ 11 ]	1
24061	The Northern Pacific coast region ( which includes Humboldt Co	1
24062	) is unusual in that this is the only region of CA where large numbers of gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) are known to be infected with the @DISEASE$ variant [ 11 ] .	1
24063	If these results are confirmed in other scenarios , it follows that the use of overhead low - level far - UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne - mediated @DISEASE$ such as @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$	1
24064	In fact the potential use of ultraviolet light for airborne disinfection is by no means new , and was first demonstrated more than 80 years ago 8 , 22	1
24065	As applied more recently , airborne ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) utilizes conventional germicidal UVC light in the upper part of the room , with louvers to prevent direct exposure of potentially occupied room areas 23	1
24066	This results in blocking more than 95 % of the UV radiation exiting the UVGI fixture , with substantial decrease in effectiveness 24	1
24067	By contrast , use of low - level far - UVC fixtures , which are potentially safe for human exposure , could provide the desired antimicrobial benefits without the accompanying human health concerns of conventional germicidal lamp UVGI .	1
24068	In our study , about two - thirds of @DISEASE$ cases and all fatalities were @GENE$ - associated	1
24069	During the postpandemic seasons 1 / 2 / 3 , the proportion of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 cases among the @DISEASE$ patients was 79 % / 14 % / 65 % and , thus , considerably higher than the proportion of this subtype reported among outpatients by national influenza surveillance ( 65 % / 1 % / 34 % ) [ 17 ]	1
24070	This observation suggests @GENE$ dm09 may be associated more often with a severe course of @DISEASE$ requiring PICU treatment than other influenza types / subtypes	1
24071	Similar observations on the proportio@GENE$ of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated @DISEASE$ admissions have been reported in the United States [ 9 ] .	1
24072	Proteomic based approaches have been widely used to develop extensive @GENE$ databases that focus on infection by viruses 16 , 17	1
24073	However , no such study has been conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in host response to @DISEASE$ infection	1
24074	Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) is an in vitro labelling method that has the capability to compare several time points during a single experiment 18	1
24075	The method is considered more sensitive than difference gel electrophoresis , and it has been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in characterising numerous diseases 19 , 20	1
24076	In this study , we utilis@GENE$ iTRAQ - labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by @DISEASE$ infection	1
24077	Our findings will help to reveal the biological processes of different infection stages and systematically understand the host response under @DISEASE$ infection .	1
24078	HMPV is reported to have an important contribution to @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) in Africa	1
24079	For instance , @DISEASE$ - associated hospitalization was estimated at 6	1
24080	5 per 1000 person years in infants in Soweto , South Africa [ 4 ] ; at 4 % in hospitalized children with severe @DISEASE$ during a 2 - year period in Cameroon [ 5 ] ; and in rural western Kenya , incidence of @DISEASE$ associated with @DISEASE$ cases in outpatient clinic visits was estimated at 0	1
24081	43 per 100 person - years among outpatients [ 6 ]	1
24082	In Kilifi coastal Kenya , between January 2007 to December 2011 , children under 6 months of age accounted for 44 % of @DISEASE$ positive cases , while 74 % were children under 1 year , and 1	1
24083	3 % ( 2 / 160 ) were children > 36 months [ 7 ]	1
24084	In Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in Kenya , @DISEASE$ was detected in 5	1
24085	7 % hospitalizations , and virus - positive crude hospitalization rate ( per 1000 children < 5 years old ) was 4 for @DISEASE$ [ 8 ]	1
24086	In Mali , contribution of HMPV to @DISEASE$ had a population attributable fraction of 9 % ( 95 % CI : 7 - 11 % ) [ 9 ] ; while in Morocco [ 10 ] , 8	1
24087	9 % of children < 5 years admitted with severe @DISEASE$ were infected with HMPV	1
24088	HMPV prevalence and incidence elsewhere globally , is indicated in Additional file 4 : Table S1	1
24089	Of note is that the variations in incidence rates could be attributed to study population , seasonality and even detection methods	1
24090	Nonetheless , genomic epidemiology of @DISEASE$ in Africa is inadequately reported , and comparison of genetic similarity and differences between African and global strains is not documented .	1
24091	From January 2004 to March 2004 , there were outbreaks of acute , highly transmissible , lethal diseases in chickens at four poultry farms in Japan : one in Oita , one in Yamaguchi , and two in Kyoto Prefecture ( Figure 1 )	1
24092	Virus isolates from infected chickens were all identified as influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype [ 5 ]	1
24093	Such highly pathogenic @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) epidemics had not been reported in Japan for 79 years	1
24094	Two @DISEASE$ outbreaks at poultry farms in Tamba Town , Kyoto Prefecture , were the last two outbreaks of the 2004 avian epidemics in Japan	1
24095	Since then , there were outbreaks of @DISEASE$ in Okayama and Miyazaki Prefectures in 2007	1
24096	The H5N1 virus was also isolated from dead Whooper swans , Cygnus cygnus , in 2008 in Towada Lake , Akita Prefecture [ 6 ]	1
24097	In addition , outbreaks of other subtypes of avian influenza virus have frequently occurred in Japan	1
24098	The @DISEASE$ was reported in Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures in 2005 and 2006 , the H3 subtype was reported in Saitama Prefecture in 2009 , and the H7 subtype was in Aichi Prefecture in 2009	1
24099	We know of no report suggesting that H5N1 virus could be transmitted efficaciously from person to person , but the possibility remains that such transmission could evolve [ 7 ] .	1
24100	Successful bat research networks rely on strong connections among members that are formed through trust , collaboration , and dialogue , and will weaken or cease to exist if any of these elements are missing [ 21 ]	1
24101	Therefore , whether the aim of a network is to bolster relationships between already - connected members or foster new relationships with novel or unfamiliar actors , a network ' s structure and long - term sustainability are dependent on clear and consistent communication [ 21 , 146 ]	1
24102	Several ways to ensure such communication include : participating in scientific conferences , hosting regular workshops , and creating social media and other communication platforms that allow for direct dialogue and information sharing	1
24103	Scientific conferences , whether domestic or international , act as centers of learning and networking	1
24104	Individuals can discover new and exciting research paths , present on shared research , and identify new network members	1
24105	Workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking , data sharing , and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network ' s scope	1
24106	For example , Fair et al	1
24107	[ 146 ] used a systems dynamic model to show that a single 2 - week bat - borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output , which included @GENE$ members	1
24108	The @GENE$ currently organizes a collaborative workshop held in a different country in Western Asia each year , bringing together bat biologists , virologists , public health officials , and other relevant professionals	1
24109	The first workshop was held in Tbilisi , Georgia , from 17 - 20 September 2018 , and included 39 workshop participants from 14 countries , of which 21 participants were from 10 countries in Western Asia	1
24110	Finally , websites and social media accounts can facilitate information sharing and discussion among research teams , and provide the public with information about the network , its members , and ongoing research plans [ 21 , 151 ]	1
24111	A dedicated @GENE$ website ( www	1
24112	wabnet	1
24113	org ) is in development to provide essential information to its members and the broader scientific community .	1
24114	In order to encourage a multidisciplinary , collaborative approach that integrates bat conservation and disease surveillance , WAB - Net aims to : conduct on - the - ground research to bring together regional experts from a variety of disciplines ( e	1
24115	g	1
24116	, bat ecologists , conservationists , virologists , public health officials ) ; strengthen scientific capacity via research exchanges , data sharing platforms , in - region laboratory testing , and annual workshops ; and promote the development and leadership of local scientists and officials	1
24117	Taken together , these activities represent a coordinated strategy to advance scientific knowledge and capacity around @DISEASE$ emergence and bat conservation in Western Asia	1
24118	Additionally , WAB - Net has formed @GENE$ nitial Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB ) to help guide and oversee the network , comprised of a group of global experts with backgrounds in bat ecology and conservation , virology and laboratory diagnostics , and @DISEASE$ disease ecology	1
24119	The SAB was formed to review proposed scientific activities , provide expertise during annual data sharing and capacity building workshops , monitor the network ' s growth and communication , and help liaise with regional and global stakeholders .	1

24167	Figure 9 compares the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curves for the four models across the five EDs using the linear filter ( Across all models , the sensitivity for the 1 - day filter was the lowest while the 7 - day and linear filters tended to have the highest sensitivity )	1

24171	This is due to the insignificance of the day - ofweek fixed effect in Models 2 and 3	1

24183	All function calls in all the client packages perform these basic services .	1
24184	As indicated above , the improvement in sequencing speed and efficiency led to a rapid accumulation of @GENE$ and necessitated more efficient methods for large - scale access to genomes , annotations , subsystems , and genome - scale models within the @GENE$	1
24185	A @GENE$ server was first developed to allow programmatic access to the @GENE$ data [ 21 ] , but several performance issues prevented the service from scaling with the volume of data contained within the @GENE$ database	1
24186	The server abstraction layer required the loading of numerous large modules on each invocation of server functionality , resulting in a noticeable delay in response to each server request	1
24187	The encapsulation of the results in SOAP XML conferred significant overhead on the data being transferred	1
24188	Finally , each operation of the @GENE$ server was atomic , accepting a single argument and returning a single datum	1
24189	Trivial requests such as retrieving all the functions for all of the proteins in a genome took unacceptably long to complete , requiring a separate call for each protein and instantiating many threads on the server	1
24190	The four @GENE$ described here provide programmatic access to the @GENE$ data and methods	1
24191	They expose the current data in a form that is conveniently accessed computationally	1
24192	The installation and maintenance of the client - side software require minimal effort	1
24193	We have constructed the underlying methods to support relatively large - grained data transfers , allowing the construction of relatively efficient programs	1
24194	In comparison to the @GENE$ server [ 21 ] , the new web services provide access to larger amounts of data in less time , and they have been engineered to respond to server requests with little or no server - side delay	1
24195	Furthermore , the new web services provide a more efficient and flexible computing approach because they are designed to process batches of requests at a time , streaming the responses as they complete	1
24196	These services provide access to the integrated @GENE$ data , subsystems , @GENE$ , co - occurrence data , annotation services , RAST annotation submission and job retrieval ( thereby offering access to our continuing improvements in microbial annotation ) , and metabolic modeling	1

24201	Evolving serotypes associated with severe @DISEASE$ , @DISEASE$ , and PICU admission despite prior immunization have been previously reported locally [ 4 ] .	1
24202	All @GENE$ were retrieved from GenBank ( January 2018 ) using the query ( txid162145 ( Organism ) AND 12000 ( SLEN ) : 14000 ( SLEN ) NOT patent )	1
24203	Sequence entries with gaps larger than 6 nt were excluded to generate a set of yielding @GENE$	1
24204	All possible 23 nt sequences were generated from the @GENE$ dataset and trimmed to a final calculated melting temperature ( Tm ) of 47	1

24211	The @GENE$ was then made nonredundant yielding 60 , 746 potential primers	1
24212	All potential primers were mapped against the @GENE$ and the number of perfect matches ( frequency score ) was determined as a measure of primer sequence conservation	1
24213	To select primers , the @GENE$ were divided into amplicons with @GENE$ spanning the @GENE$	1
24214	Potential primers that mapped within the @GENE$ of each amplicon were identified and the sequence with the highest frequency score was selected , and primers mapping to the reverse bins were reverse complemented	1
24215	In this manner , 24 primers were selected for each of the 4 @GENE$ ( GenBank accession number HMPV A1 : AF371337 , HMPV A2 : FJ168779 ; HMPV B1 : AY525843 , and HMPV B2 : FJ168778 )	1
24216	Because of conservation between genotypes , there was primer redundancy which was removed	1
24217	The final set of @GENE$ , their lengths , calculated Tm , fractional GC content and mapping position on the @GENE$ are presented in Additional file 5 : Table S2	1
24218	The primers were computationally tested against each of the 4 HMPV subgroups	1
24219	A graphical representation of the @GENE$ is presented in Additional file 1 : Figure S1 .	1
24220	Keeping the Thai clade isolates in focus while analyzing the large dataset , the results obtained with ProtPars agree with the trend obtained so far	1
24221	All twelve core sequences are mapped to the Thai clade	1
24222	Besides these twelve , ten more sequences were found in this clade , whereby eight of them are fragments	1
24223	The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand ( chicken isolates )	1
24224	However , they were annotated as @GENE$ instead of @GENE$ [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set	1
24225	However , querying of Uniprot with " @DISEASE$ virus " and " NA " as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis	1
24226	Zooming out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor , followed further by the Indian clade with Vietnam strains as their neighbors	1
24227	On the next higher level Indonesian , Malaysian and Chinese clades are indicated as neighbors	1
24228	It would be interesting to further study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level	1
24229	Such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in India	1
24230	Further analysis of the large dataset indicates @GENE$ as the nearest clade to @GENE$ and @GENE$ as nearest to @GENE$ within the @GENE$ _ NA group	1
24231	The overall tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9	1
24232	A detailed analysis of each clade and sub - clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of @GENE$ ' s molecular evolution at global level .	1
24233	Astrocytic cultures	1
24234	Mouse primary astrocytes were isolated from primary mixed glial - cell cultures of newborn ICR mice , as described previously 82 , 83	1
24235	The purity of the astrocytes was > 95 % , as determined by immunostaining with the @GENE$	1
24236	Astrocytes were plated at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells / well in 6 - well dishes	1
24237	Cells were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s minimum essential medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 5 mg / ml @GENE$ insulin , and 0	1
24238	2 % glucose	1
24239	To assess the expression of @GENE$ , confluent astrocytes were treated with 1 μg / ml LPS and / or HM	1
24240	H 2 treatment was performed by replacing the astroglial medium with HM , and dehydrogenated HM was used as a control medium	1
24241	The time course of H 2 concentration in HM was described previously 12	1
24242	Replacement of the astroglial medium with HM or control medium was performed 3 h before the addition of LPS .	1
24243	To date , other routes of transmission including vertical or horizontal pathways have not been described or demonstrated in cats as they have been in dogs , mice or humans [ 1 ] .	1
24244	The best candidate gene in the Chr2 : 68	1
24245	8 6 0	1
24246	4 Mb interval was @GENE$ which is expressed in endothelial cells , heart , and highly n Table 6 The @GENE$ contains genes involved in ion transport that are associated with @DISEASE$ and dysregulated in atrial vascularized tissues including the lung ( Zimmermann et al	1
24247	2002 ) , and has clear potential as a r@GENE$  A primary function of N@GENE$ s to modulate the activity of e@GENE$  e@GENE$  by sequestering e@GENE$ way from the plasma membrane ( Zimmermann et al	1
24248	2002 )	1
24249	In turn , this prevents the calcium - mediated release of nitric oxide ( NO ) ( Zimmermann et al	1
24250	2002 ) , a potent modifier of cardiac function , including regulation of contractility ( Massion et al	1
24251	2003 ; Petroff et al	1
24252	2001 )	1
24253	Alternative splicing of N@GENE$ roduces a t@GENE$  N@GENE$  which is primarily localized to the nucleus ( Wiesenthal et al	1
24254	2009 ) and represses transcription from its own promoter ( Kim et al	1
24255	2005 ; Wiesenthal et al	1
24256	2009 )	1
24257	Therefore N@GENE$ ould also influence transcription of other genes within the p@GENE$  A model can be envisaged where N@GENE$ lters expression of R@GENE$  the linkage peak for the R@GENE$ ontains N@GENE$  , leading to altered splicing of N@GENE$  as well as other key m@GENE$  , to provide feedback from stretch - induced NO release and result in altered contractile properties	1
24258	Interestingly , R@GENE$ as been shown to directly influence alternative splicing of Z@GENE$ nd T@GENE$  Guo et al	1
24259	2013 ) , both of which were identified as candidate u@GENE$ n the other two e@GENE$ eaks identified in this study	1
24260	The e@GENE$ nterval located at Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the p@GENE$  R@GENE$ nd Z@GENE$  Since a defined relationship exists between Z@GENE$ nd cardiac function , we suggest that Z@GENE$ s the better candidate	1
24261	Z@GENE$ as been shown to bind directly to SMAD3 / 4 which prevents recruitment of p300 to target promoters and results in the downregulation of transforming growth factor - b ( TGFb ) target genes in A549 lung epithelial cells ( Feng et al	1
24262	2014 )	1
24263	This is relevant since transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of TGFb 1 were shown to develop atrial but not ventricular fibrosis and had increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation ( Nakajima et al	1
24264	2000 ; Verheule et al	1
24265	2004 )	1
24266	Upregulation of TGFb 1 is also known to induce myocardial hypertrophy ( Parker et al	1
24267	1990 ) and is evident in animal models of heart failure ( Dobaczewski et al	1
24268	2011 )	1
24269	However , therapies which block TGFb would be expected to have adverse effects due to the pleiotropic nature of TGFb signaling ( Dobaczewski et al	1
24270	2011 )	1
24271	In future studies , it will be important to determine if ZFP451 expression in the pulmonary myocardium and heart of atrial fibrillation patients is altered in parallel with increased TGFb expression ; if so , this transcription factor might be a viable therapeutic target .	1
24272	process	1
24273	This process is tightly orchestrated by several @GENE$	1
24274	In brief , HCV is believed to first interact with @GENE$ and @GENE$ on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion	1
24275	Subsequently , interaction with other @GENE$ such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ , and @GENE$ ultimately leads to viral internalization via the socalled @GENE$ - mediated endocytosis	1
24276	Fusion between viral and endosomal membranes is followed by release of the @GENE$ into the cytosol , where translation and replication take place	1
24277	Finally , HCV particles are assembled and released from the hepatocytes .	1
24278	Sexual transmission of HIV - 1 requires that virus establish infection across genital tract or intestinal tissue	1
24279	Sexually transmitted infections , other causes of @DISEASE$ , and localized trauma may allow susceptible CD4 + target cells at skin or mucosal surfaces to become directly exposed to secretions from infected sexual partners [ 1 , 2 ]	1
24280	However , when skin and mucosa are intact , it remains unclear precisely how HIV - 1 gains access to target cells	1
24281	One possibility is that virus translocates between epithelial cells until susceptible cells are found either in or below the epithelium [ 3 ]	1
24282	Alternatively , Langerhans cells may sample the surface , acquire virus , and move it to areas of abundant target cells [ 4 , 5 ]	1
24283	Finally , transcytosis of HIV - 1 ( i	1
24284	e	1
24285	, movement through cells ) has been studied as a potential mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeperlying CD4 + cells [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] .	1
24286	In this experiment , 10 birds were challenged to evaluate whether @DISEASE$ played a role in the spread of the virus to extra - respiratory and extra - digestive tissues	1
24287	Birds were swabbed in the trachea on day 2 pi , to ensure infection was ongoing	1
24288	On days 2 and 3 pi , five birds were sedated with 300 µL of tiletamine and zolazepam via the intramuscular route and euthanized by exsanguination , via cardiac puncture to collect as much blood as possible and test both blood cells and plasma for the presence o@GENE$ A .	1
24289	To identify air transportation communities , we approximate a maximal - modularity subdivision of the 1 , 227 - largest - airport network by employing a recently described stochastic Monte - Carlo approach [ 18 ]	1
24290	Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non - overlapping groups ; for a definition we refer to [ 19 ]	1
24291	For any given partition , modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low	1
24292	For large networks , a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision	1
24293	The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition	1
24294	For further details we refer to [ 18 , 20 ] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach .	1
24295	A study by ten Hoeve et al	1
24296	[ 21 ] , found that one of the independent functions of a nurse is education	1
24297	According to a study that was done by WHO [ 1 ] , healthcare professionals need to seek up - to - date scientific knowledge from national , and international , academic and research institutions , including professional associations	1
24298	The findings of this study revealed that there was a lack of skills and in - service training in the wards	1
24299	This finding concurs with those of a study conducted by Yang et al	1
24300	[ 22 ] , which indicated various barriers contributing to poor @DISEASE$ treatment , such as communication difficulties , low literacy level , inadequate knowledge , and low awareness of @DISEASE$ disease .	1
24301	@DISEASE$ is a major occupational hazard for Health care workers ( HCWs ) worldwide	1
24302	The transmission of drug - sensitive and drug - resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs through infected droplets aerosolized by patients with active pulmonary @DISEASE$	1
24303	The transmission risk to HCWs is highest when patients have unrecognized @DISEASE$ or are receiving inappropriate treatment	1
24304	However , many other factors influence the risk of transmission and progression to active disease , including healthcare setting , occupational category , individual susceptibility / immune status , and the adequacy of @DISEASE$ infection control measures .	1
24305	In this present study , we characterized the immunoreactivity of recombinant HCV polypeptides derived from many different regions of the @GENE$ expressed in bacteria	1
24306	The purpose of synthesizing these segments is to determine which segments encoded by the genome are significant for the development of anti - HCV assays and to find a @GENE$ which incorporates all of the major @GENE$ from the functional regions of the @GENE$	1
24307	Therefore , we first constructed the different @GENE$ into vectors containing @GENE$ or @GENE$ to induce expression	1
24308	The proteins were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as fusion proteins with a @GENE$ or @GENE$ used for detection and affinity purification	1
24309	The immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti - HCV sera	1
24310	Our results showed that the @GENE$ were expressed successfully	1
24311	The sera studied recognized the core and @GENE$ at very high levels , whereas the other proteins , such as @GENE$ , @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ , were found to have lower levels of reactivity	1
24312	The @GENE$ rarely reacted with anti - HCV positive serum	1
24313	Thus , the @GENE$ in combination with a new @GENE$ ( @GENE$ aa ) constitutes almost all of the major @GENE$ of the HCV	1
24314	However , this study does not exclude the possibility that the low reactivity to some @GENE$ is due to a quantitative reduction in the titer of antibodies and not due to an absence of reactivity .	1
24315	This study will be highly informative for countries where livestock movement data are not routinely available	1
24316	The outputs of this work will provide guidance to livestock industries around the world regarding both the quantity of data required to predict spread of disease and how to target data collection should it not be possible to record all livestock movements .	1
24317	Anti - infective therapy was applied according to the local guideline considering local resistance patterns .	1
24318	As shown in Fig	1
24319	3a - e , the retained functions of these proteins at each time point are depicted	1
24320	Enriched functions of the @GENE$ at 12 hpi were mainly related to the cell cycle , including regulation of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle	1
24321	At 24 hpi , numerous proteins involved in RNA processing were enriched	1
24322	By 36 hpi , the @GENE$ were significantly enriched in proteins related to @GENE$ assembly ( p = 1	1
24323	88E - 14 )	1
24324	At 48 hpi , enriched functions were related to @GENE$ assembly ( p = 3	1
24325	91E - 08 ) and regulation of organelle organisation ( p = 2	1
24326	99E - 05 )	1
24327	The functional terms in the regulation of apoptosis were enriched at each time point ; but at 60 hpi , proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis became the largest component ( 8	1
24328	51 % ) of all @GENE$ .	1
24329	International human travel is thought to have facilitated the spread of the @DISEASE$ epidemic	1
24330	The @DISEASE$ was thought to have been introduced to South America between May and December 2013	1
24331	During this time , there were three major international events held in Brazil - World Youth Day in July 2013 , the Fifa World Cup in 2014 , and the World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro in 2014 - that may have been responsible for this introduction ( Possas 2016 )	1
24332	The World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro was attended by a team from French Polynesia , where the @DISEASE$ outbreak first occurred ( Possas 2016 ; Gautret and Simon 2016 )	1
24333	These types of mass gatherings attracting international travelers put attendees at greater risk for transmission of @DISEASE$ ( Gautret and Simon 2016 ; World Health Organization 2017b )	1
24334	Despite these risks , the WHO only advised pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant to avoid traveling to Zikaaffected regions but did not implement a travel ban ( Lima - Camara 2016 ) .	1
24335	cytotoxins to @DISEASE$ cells 14	1
24336	One of these agents , a cyclic version of the NGR peptide complexed to t@GENE$  alpha , is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials in @DISEASE$ .	1

24339	To demonstrate the effects of human movement on aerosol dispersion in the airplane cabin , Figure 2 gives the timing diagrams of the average position of all the aerosols for case 1 ~ 3 in X direction ( lateral position ) , Y direction ( longitudinal position ) and Z direction ( vertical position ) , respectively	1
24340	The average position is the average value of the absolute positions of all the airborne aerosols at time t .	1
24341	The quantitative comparison of three main policy approaches , ( i ) changing ventilation rates only ; ( ii ) filtration of outdoor air ; and ( iii ) indoor source control , showed that all three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks varying from approximately 20 % to 44 % , corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000 saved healthy life years in EU - 26 .	1
24342	Health determinants of housing in general are discussed in WHO 2011 [ 18 ] , safe levels of specific chemicals indoors in WHO 2010 [ 2 ] and guidelines for exposure to dampness and mould specifically in WHO 2009 [ 1 ]	1
24343	The current enhancement of the health impact assessment with the above described mass - balance approach to account for variable ventilation is built on the previous achievements of EnVIE [ 19 ] and IAIAQ projects [ 20 ] and the corresponding models for environmental burden of disease caused by indoor air quality	1
24344	These models were based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease ( BoD ) for each exposure and disease and national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European - 8 - indoor concentration estimates of each pollutant	1

24351	In addition , second hand smoke exposures at home were added using exposure data from a European survey [ 21 ] .	1
24352	We recruited cases from an open cohort of children less than 3 years of age , who were under monthly active and passive surveillance for @DISEASE$	1
24353	Trained fieldworkers referred children with @DISEASE$ to the study clinic at the outpatient department ( OPD ) at Siddhi Memorial Hospital in Bhaktapur , and families could bring their children for free treatment at our clinic for common childhood illnesses	1
24354	Children residing in Bhaktapur district , but outside the municipality , were only under such passive surveillance	1
24355	Children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing ( @DISEASE$ ) and classified according to the standard World Health Organization ( WHO ) algorithm for @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) [ 19 ] ( Figure 1 )	1
24356	@DISEASE$ was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with fast breathing , that is ≥ 50 breaths / min for children 2 to 11 months old , and ≥ 40 breaths / min for children ≥ 12 months old	1
24357	@DISEASE$ was defined as @DISEASE$ or difficult breathing combined with @DISEASE$	1
24358	Children with @DISEASE$ auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2	1
24359	5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart followed by reassessment after 30 min , which is in accordance with the revised WHO guidelines [ 20 ]	1
24360	A child was included only if he or she had fast breathing or @DISEASE$ at reassessment .	1

24362	DU145 and PC3 cells were washed with PBS and harvested mechanically with a cell scraper	1
24363	A total of 1 × 10 6 cells were incubated with 500 nmol / L cyc - LHSPW - ( Gly ) 4 - FITC or @GENE$ - CD13 antibody ( 22A5 - FITC , Miltenyi ) for 60 minutes at 4 ° C	1
24364	Stained samples and controls were assayed on a BD Facscalibur	1
24365	Tumor sections frozen in OCT medium were sectioned at a thickness of 7 μm and briefly fixed in cold acetone for 10 min	1
24366	After rinsing in PBS , the sections were stained with 250 nM cyc - LHSPW - ( Gly ) 4 - FITC overnight at 4 ° C	1
24367	The sections were washed with PBS and mounted with DAPI Prolong Gold	1
24368	The slides were visualized using a Nikon 6D High Throughput Epifluorescence Microscope .	1

24371	The treatments were distributed in equal portions bilaterally in axillary and inguinal regions	1
24372	Heparinized blood was collected at time points 0 h ( just before injection of the treatment ) , 8 h , 24 h , 48 h , 96 h and 192 h	1
24373	The cats were clinically examined and body temperature was measured at each time point	1
24374	Whole blood samples were used in part for the assessment of hematological paramaters with the Sysmex XT 2000iV ( Sysmex , Norderstedt , Germany ) as previously described [ 57 ]	1
24375	The rest of the blood was mixed with mRNA lysis buffer ( Roche Diagnostics ) immediately upon blood collection and processed as recommended by the manufacturer	1
24376	Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood samples for 10 min at 1500 × g and conserved at − 80 ° C until use for in vitro experiments	1
24377	@GENE$ expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of two @GENE$ as described above	1
24378	The expression factors depicted in the figures represent the ratio of mRNA levels from a specific time point to mRNA levels from time point 0 h	1
24379	For viral inhibition assays , the plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf - 4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV	1
24380	The assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows :	1
24381	The essential oil of Ageratum conyzoides L	1
24382	, mainly constituted by precocene I and caryophyllene , possessed good capacity for preventing lipid peroxidation , using as lipid substrate liver homogenate [ 51 ]	1
24383	The results were even better than those found for the reference BHA	1
24384	The authors have also tested methanolic extracts of the same plants but the activities were about 100 times lower than those of the essential oils	1
24385	The authors also hypothesise that the antiaflatoxigenic activity found for the essential oils may be partly due to their antioxidant activity [ 51 ] .	1
24386	The essential oils of different parts of Myrtus communis var	1
24387	italica L	1
24388	leaf , stem and flower were chemically evaluated	1
24389	α - Pinene and 1 , 8 - cineole dominated the leaf oil ; 1 , 8 - cineole , α - pinene , transcaryophyllene and linalool constituted the major components of the stem oil , whereas in the flower oil , along with these 4 components , there was also α - terpineol and eugenol	1
24390	Leaf and flower oils had the best antixidant activities , nevertheless inferior to those of BHT and BHA	1
24391	The authors [ 46 ] attributed such weak activities to the low level of phenolic compounds ( eugenol in the flowers ) or even their absence ( stem and leaf ) , because the extracts also studied in the present work presented higher activities	1
24392	Nevertheless it is worthy to refer the similar activities found in leaf and flower oils , in spite of the absence or phenols in leaf oils .	1
24393	Statistical analysis was performed using Stata ( version 14 STATSCorp , USA )	1
24394	Descriptive statistics : Monthly prevalences of individual @DISEASE$ symptoms were computed by taking the average over all subjects available at each month and then averaging over all 18 months covered	1
24395	Prevalences at the seasonal level were computed accordingly averaging over all three seasons covered	1
24396	The corresponding confidence intervals ( CIs ) and p - values are based on a generalised linear model with identity link and binomial type variance together with robust variance estimates	1
24397	The frequency of long lasting infections among all months with infections was analysed accordingly	1
24398	However , due to the limited number of cases for @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ we determined the monthly frequency of long - lasting infections by pooling the data over all seasons and for @DISEASE$ by pooling all indicated months .	1
24399	Despite an increasing focus on Bartonella genetic diversity and prevalence in bat communities , individual risk factors and transmission routes of this pathogen in bats remain largely unknown	1
24400	For example , a survey of vampire bats within Guatemala found neither geographic , dietary , demographic , or viral coinfection correlates of @DISEASE$ infection status [ 44 ]	1
24401	Using a larger sample across a more diverse range of study sites and timepoints , we here show that Bartonella is genetically diverse , geographically widespread and endemic within vampire bat populations , and that individual - level odds of infection are highest for large , male , and nonreproductive bats	1
24402	Furthermore , we use several approaches to suggest vector - borne transmission to be likely in addition to possible direct contact and environmental sources of Bartonella exposure in bats .	1

24404	The infection of control mice with ZIKV - PR209 virus produced a marked decrease in body weight along with decreased mobility , hunched posture , hindlimb knuckle walking and / or @DISEASE$ ( Figures 5e , f ) .	1
24405	The brains from treated mice were immersed in RNAlater ( Ambion , Waltham , MA , USA ) 4 ° C for 1 week , then stored at − 80 ° C	1
24406	The brain tissue was then weighed and homogenised in 600 μl RLT buffer in a 2 ml cryovial using a TissueLyser ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) with a stainless steel bead for 6 min at 30 cycles / s	1
24407	@GENE$ was also isolated from blood with the RNeasy Plus mini kit ( Qiagen )	1
24408	A ZIKV specific real - time RT - PCR assay was utilised for the detection of @GENE$ from subject animals	1
24409	RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the primers @GENE$ and ZIKV 911c and probe ZIKV 860FAM with the TaqMan Fast Virus 1 - Step Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA )	1
24410	A standard curve was generated in parallel for each plate and used for the quantification of @GENE$ copy numbers	1
24411	The StepOnePlus Real - Time PCR System ( Life Technologies Corporation , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) software version 2	1
24412	3 was used to calculate the cycle threshold ( Ct ) values , and a Ct value [UNK] 38 for at least one of the replicates was considered positive , as previously described	1
24413	29 Pre - bleeds were negative in this assay .	1
24414	While PPMOs are being routinely tested against RNA viruses , there have only been a handful of studies documenting the use of PPMO technology against DNA viruses	1
24415	The first report came from Zhang et a l	1
24416	who were interested in blocking @DISEASE$ ( KSHV ) lytic replication [ 84 ]	1
24417	They explored the effects of the inhibition of the expression of KSHV latency - associated nuclear @GENE$ cr@GENE$ n acti@GENE$ la@GENE$ y maintenance and in the switch to lytic phase , respectively	1
24418	To do so , the investigators designed PMOs directed against LANA and RTA and covalently conjug@GENE$ them@GENE$ their 5 ' terminal to R 5 F 2 R 4 C peptide	1
24419	While fluorescein ( Fl ) - labeled PMOs entered cells poorly , Fl - PPMOs were efficiently taken up by BCBL - 1 lymphocytes which , as emphasized by the authors , are difficult to efficiently transfect with common techniques such as lipofectamine	1
24420	PPMOs could effectively inhibit RTA and LANA protein expression in@GENE$ l cu@GENE$ 	1
24421	Treatment of KSHV - infected cells with RTA PPMO suppressed KSHV lytic rep@GENE$ tion	1
24422	RTA knock down resulted in reduced@GENE$ els of proteins expressed downstream of RTA	1
24423	One of these downstream prot@GENE$  is viral interleukin - 6 ( vIL - 6 ) @GENE$ ss@GENE$ or the development of @DISEASE$	1
24424	In a subsequent study , Zhang et al	1
24425	blocked the expression of vIL - 6 with PPMOs	1
24426	vIL - 6 PMOs were covalently c@GENE$ d at their 5 @GENE$ XR ) 4 XB or R 5 F 2 R 4 C	1
24427	PPMO treatment inhibited vIL - 6 expression , which in turn reduced human IL@GENE$ el and KSHV yield , and reduced growth of@GENE$ d cells [ 85 ] .	1
24428	There were several limitations to this study , including the relatively small study population that was below the initial target of 25 cats per treatment group	1
24429	Additional numbers may have been required to demonstrate a significant difference in Diet B and between the two dietary interventions	1
24430	This study also relied on a comparison to baseline versus a comparison to a non - therapeutic control formula	1
24431	A non - therapeutic control would have been ideal for establishing effectiveness of the therapeutic diets ; however , due to ethical considerations , all study participants were provided with a therapeutic dietary intervention	1
24432	Additionally , this study relied on the owner ' s recall to establish the baseline weekly vomiting frequency	1
24433	A recorded baseline would have been preferred ; however , it was decided that it was not in the cats ' best interest to delay dietary intervention	1
24434	Finally , the lack of significance may have been influenced by the variability of clinical disease within individual cats	1
24435	It was appreciated in this study that while most cats had a progressive decline of vomiting occurrences , some cats had episodic occurrences of @DISEASE$ that varied from week to week ( Figure 1 )	1
24436	The 4 - week feeding period was chosen to approximate a reasonable duration for a dietary trial with a gastrointestinal therapeutic formula before additional diagnostic procedures and / or medical treatments would be employed to better characterize and manage the underlying disease	1
24437	While this study did not follow the cats beyond the 4 - week period , it would have been optimal to evaluate this cohort for 4 - 6 months to identify whether there were recrudescence of clinical signs and any differences between the two diet groups long term .	1

24439	There remains much to be explored about the effects of overlapping species distributions on viral sharing in the region	1
24440	Eidolon helvum , the second largest Old World fruit bat in Africa and potential reservoir host for @DISEASE$ and other zoonotic pathogens [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] , is widespread and panmictic across sub - Saharan Africa but occurs in small areas of Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia [ 40 , 114 , 115 ]	1
24441	Other bat species found within the region have been linked with viruses of concern to human health in at least part of their geographic range	1
24442	Rhinolophus hipposideros , a species whose range extends from the United Kingdom , east to China and south to Ethiopia ( covering much of South , Central , and Western Asia ) [ 116 ] , has been found to harbor SARS - like CoVs	1
24443	In Slovenia , for example , nearly 40 % of fecal samples collected from R	1
24444	hipposideros tested positive for SARS - like CoVs , in particular the bat - associated SARS isolate Rp3 / 2004 [ 117 ]	1
24445	There is also evidence that through cross - species viral sharing , R	1
24446	hipposideros contributed to a recombinant CoV strain thought to have ancestral linkages to HCoV - NL63 [ 118 ] , a human - CoV that can account for up to 10 % of @DISEASE$ annually [ 119 ]	1
24447	Given the paucity of research on bat - associated viruses to date and the extensive species overlap from diverse biogeographic regions , Western Asia presents an untapped opportunity to further investigate the factors that determine cross - species viral transmission .	1
24448	The role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of @DISEASE$ An ecological perspective	1
24449	Our results suggest that @GENE$ might facilitate infection in hosts without pre - existing antibody or with a non - neutralizing @GENE$ response to prior infection ( which would result in secondary infection ) or to vaccination	1
24450	However , @GENE$ could also play a beneficial role in preventing infection after exposure	1
24451	@GENE$ mediates the bidirectional transcytosis of @GENE$ , and in immunized individuals , could provide a conduit for @GENE$ to neutralize virus as shown for @DISEASE$ [ 19 ]	1
24452	In addition , IgG immune complex@GENE$ d CD8 + T cells in an FcRn - dependent m@GENE$  , and FcRn targeting may@GENE$  useful mucosal immunization strategy [ 62 , 63 , 64 ] .	1
24453	Virus host shifts occur frequently , but the whole range of host species and the actual transmission pathways are often poorly understood	1
24454	Deformed wing virus ( DWV ) , an RNA virus described from honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) , has been shown to have a broad host range	1
24455	Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees , foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur	1
24456	However , the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet	1
24457	Here , we show with a 16 - week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type - A and - B to infect M	1
24458	rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir	1
24459	However , the titers of both @GENE$ decreased over time	1
24460	Since the ants were fed with highly virus - saturated honeybee pupae , this probably resulted in initial viral peaks , then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later	1
24461	Since @DISEASE$ infections were also found in untreated field - collected M	1
24462	rubra colonies , our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism	1
24463	of honeybee viruses frequently happens , although it is not fully understood why and when pathogens jump between some species and not others [ 4 , 15 ] .	1
24464	@DISEASE$ is a @DISEASE$ commonly characterized by severe @DISEASE$ and @DISEASE$ , and it is associated with a high rate of morbidity in cats	1
24465	1 The disease is caused by @DISEASE$ ( @DISEASE$ ) , which belongs to the feline parvovirus subgroup within the genus Parvovirus ( family Parvoviridae ) , together with canine parvovirus ( CPV ) and other parvoviruses of carnivores	1
24466	2 @DISEASE$ can infect domestic cats and other Felidae species , as well as species of the families Mustelidae , Procyonidae and Viverridae	1
24467	3 @DISEASE$ infections in large carnivores , such as captive tigers and lions , have been described based on clinical , serological and virological data	1
24468	[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] However , the number of @DISEASE$ strains isolated from the adaptive carnivore species and the molecular information associated with these isolates are very limited	1
24469	Clinical and etiological investigations are very important for discovering the mechanism ( s ) underlying the genetic evolution and pathogenicity of @DISEASE$ .	1
24470	The @GENE$ and @GENE$ are gifts from Professor Takashi Fujita ( Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan )	1
24471	28 The @GENE$ for @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ were generous gifts from Dr Genhong Cheng ( University of California , Los Angeles , CA , USA ) , 33 , 34 whereas those for @GENE$ , @GENE$ and @GENE$ and @GENE$ as well as @GENE$ have been described elsewhere	1
24472	30 , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Viral RNA was extracted from MERS - CoV - infected Vero - E6 cells	1
24473	The @GENE$ was PCR - amplified from @GENE$ and cloned into the @GENE$ of @GENE$ with the addition of a @GENE$ with the following primers : @GENE$ ATG ACG CAA CTC ACT GA - 3 ′ ( forward ) and @GENE$ CAA TGC AAG TTC - 3 ′ ( reverse )	1
24474	The @GENE$ has been described elsewhere	1
24475	30 , 32 The @GENE$ for the SN and @GENE$ were constructed by assembly PCR with the following forward primers covering the breakpoints : @GENE$ ACC CGC TCA TGG TGG TCA TTC AAT CCT GAG - 3 ′ ( @GENE$ ) and @GENE$ - CCG GCT GTT TAT GAG AAC TGG ATC AAT GTG GTC ATT CAA CCC A - 3 ′ ( @GENE$ )	1
24476	The reverse primers were complementary to their respective forward primers	1
24477	The truncation mutant of the @GENE$ lacking the @GENE$ was constructed using the forward primer : @GENE$ GTA ACA CTT GCT TGT TTT GTG CT - 3 ′ .	1
24478	We have tested the upper limits of DNA that LAMP reactions can tolerate and found that up to 200 ng DNA in a 20 μl reaction , positive detection is reproducible	1
24479	Above this DNA level , reactions become unreliable ( data not shown ) .	1
24480	After four weeks , the colonies were randomly assigned to three treatments , differing in @DISEASE$ infected protein supply over eight - weeks : ( 1 ) The controls ( C , N = 3 ) were fed with D	1
24481	hydei ad libitum ;	1
24482	It was observed that @GENE$ disrupted TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction ( Figure 4B ) , which is required for @GENE$ activation	1
24483	We then evaluated whether @GENE$ activation would be affected by the expression of @GENE$	1
24484	@GENE$ dimerization visualized by non - denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct @GENE$ activation	1
24485	39 Therefore , we ectopically expressed @GENE$ and @GENE$ with the inducer @GENE$ in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for @GENE$ dimerization	1
24486	When the inducer @GENE$ was exclusively co - expressed with @GENE$ , the detection of an additional slow - migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of @GENE$ , which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator ( Figure 4C ; lane 2 compared with lane 1 )	1
24487	Interestingly , when @GENE$ was expressed , the signal reflecting the dimeric form of @GENE$ was significantly diminished , even though the total @GENE$ level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS - PAGE ( Figure 4C ; lower panel for SDS - PAGE ) , suggesting that @GENE$ activation was greatly inhibited by the @GENE$	1
24488	@GENE$ phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of @GENE$ in a similar experimental setup ( Figure 4D ; lane 3 compared with lane 2 )	1
24489	Together with other results , @GENE$ was thought to interact with @GENE$ to perturb TRAF3 @GENE$ interaction , which , in turn , affects @GENE$ phosphorylation and activation .	1
