Several rodent - borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans , hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas . It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases . However , in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined , little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses . Because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms , it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur . Despite these limitations , recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus / reservoir relationships .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 241}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 538, "end": 549}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 921}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
