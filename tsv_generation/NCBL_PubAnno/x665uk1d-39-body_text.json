DNase I and 3D8 scFv at concentrations ranging from 1 . 5625610 23 units to 0 . 05 units were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator ( iNCYTO ) . Uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
