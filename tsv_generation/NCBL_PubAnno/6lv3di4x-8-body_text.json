Following infection of airway epithelial cells by respiratory viruses , such as influenza virus , rhinovirus , parainfluenza virus type 1 , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , or severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus , several proinflammatory cytokines are induced , including interleukin - 1 [UNK] ( IL - 1 [UNK] ) , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and interferon lambda 1 to 3 ( IFN - s ) ( 28 ) ( 29 ) ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) ( 33 ) ( 34 ) ( 35 ) . We therefore assessed the innate immune response following JEV infection of NEC . Only JEV Laos induced significant IL - 6 gene expression at a late time point ( 72 hpi [ Fig . 4A ] ) . Both JEV strains induced a significant induction of IL - 8 mRNA at 48 and 72 hpi ( Fig . 4B ) . Nevertheless , at the protein levels no virus - induced IL - 1 [UNK] , IL - 6 , or tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) was detected at any of the time points tested ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , IL - 8 secretion was enhanced at 72 hpi ( P [UNK] 0 . 001 ) in JEV Laos - infected NEC ( 2 , 055 [UNK] 595 pg / ml ) compared with those in the mock control ( 1 , 201 [UNK] 595 pg / ml ) and JEV Nakayama ( 1 , 151 [UNK] 595 pg / ml ) challenges ( values are means [UNK] standard deviations [ SD ] ) ( Fig . 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 48}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 146}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 159}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 188}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 265}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 286}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 567}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 875}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
