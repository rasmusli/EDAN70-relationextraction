Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse , however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins . Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome , it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions , suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo . Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes , and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression , localization and catalytic activity of DUBs . In this review article , we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system , and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40 - repeat ( WDR ) proteins , WDR48 / UAF1 and WDR20 , based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
