In mammalian cells , two PCBP subsets have been described , hnRNPs K / J ( 21 ) and the [UNK] CP proteins [UNK] CP1 and [UNK] CP2 , often referred to as PCBP1 and PCBP2 ( 22 , 23 ) . The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues PCBP3 and PCBP4 ( 24 ) . PCBPs are members of the KH domain superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins and have a wide spectrum of biological activities , including the regulation of RNA splicing , the stabilization of cellular and viral mRNAs , transcriptional activation and inhibition , and translational silencing and enhancement ( reviewed in Refs . 25 , 26 ) . Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays , we demonstrate that a complex of nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP binds to the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence and mimics the action of the more typical RNA pseudoknot stimulators of programmed frameshifting . This unprecedented frameshift - stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by trans - acting protein factors . Further , it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly ( C ) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
