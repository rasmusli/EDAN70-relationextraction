Macrophages release pro - inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as IL - 1\u03b2 , IL - 6 and IL - 8 upon MERS - CoV infection [ 37 ] . Similarly , MERS - CoV infection in blood monocyte - derived macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the release of chemokines and cytokines , for example , IL - 2 , IL - 3 , CCL - 2 , CCL - 3 and RANTES [ 37 , 48 ] . Infection of activated T cells induces apoptosis via different pathways which may also explain the occurrence of lymphopenia [ 52 ] . With the present available knowledge , it is difficult to describe the exact pathogenesis of MERS - CoV , but it seems that viral replication in the macrophages results in extreme cytotoxicity and triggers the induction of pro - inflammatory chemicals which may lead to MERS - associated complications .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 50}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 235}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 598}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 711}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 877, "end": 909}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
