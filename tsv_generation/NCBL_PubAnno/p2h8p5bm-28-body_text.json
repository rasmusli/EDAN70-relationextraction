Mice lacking IFNAR all succumbed within 6 days of infection , whereas 80 % of WT mice ( 6 - 8 - week - old ) survived the infection . Interestingly , all IFN\u03b2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice survived the infection , demonstrating that the IFN\u03b1s can compensate for loss of IFN\u03b2 in LGTV infection . Furthermore , IFNAR was shown to be a critical determinant of LGTV tropism as LGTV RNA was found in all organs in the absence of IFNAR , whereas in WT , only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [ 99 , 128 , 141 ] . Using transgenic mice , it was further shown that the IFN response was needed both in the peripheral tissue , as well as locally in the CNS , in order to clear LGTV infection [ 99 , 100 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 99}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 375}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 528}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 787}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
