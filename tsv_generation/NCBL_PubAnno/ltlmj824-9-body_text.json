First , the survey was conducted 7 . 3 months after the MERS outbreak , making recall bias possible . Second , it is possible that we missed some mild or asymptomatic cases . Furthermore , because the serological tests were performed several months post - exposure , pre - existing MERS antibodies may have decreased or disappeared in the interval , potentially leading to underestimation . While asymptomatic MERS infection had been detected using RT - PCR testing at the time of outbreak , 9 a Saudi Arabian study showed the longevity of MERS - CoV antibodies in MERS patients varied in the severity of illness . For example , antibodies in severely infected patients persisted after 18 months , but milder and subclinical cases detected no antibodies even early on in the disease . 10 Third , the number of participants was relatively small and may not be representative or generalizable . Despite these limitations , this study suggests that the risk of MERS transmission to public health professionals responding to MERS outside the hospital setting ( i . e . patients ' homes ) was low , particularly for those who wore some level of PPE such as masks and gloves . Further study is needed to prospectively survey public health responders including symptomatic or asymptomatic cases to conduct genetic test and serologic test during an outbreak .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 98}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 324}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 452}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 607}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 1000}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1058, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
