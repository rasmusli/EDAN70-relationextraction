It has been reported that the presence of some ingredients in the feed for weaners , such as soybeans , seems to favor the occurrence of PWD [ 92 ] . This could be due to the presence of trypsin inhibitors or antigens inducing a localized immune response [ 2 ] . Furthermore , it was shown that soya bean meal ( SBM ) reduced duodenal specific activities of most intestinal enzymes and increased crypt depth in pigs [ 93 ] . Thus , such ingredients should be avoided in feed of early - weaned pigs . In addition , feeds with decreased protein content and the addition of organic acid to reduce gastric pH were found to decrease E . coli colonization and to minimize PWD prevalence [ 31 ] . The scientific community increasingly recognizes the importance of communication and awareness among farmers in relation to antimicrobial resistance , as reflected by the growing number of publications in this area in recent years [ 18 , 94 ] . This suggests that farmers ' perceptions , and the factors affecting their behaviour , need to be better understood if effective measures associated responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials are to be implemented successfully .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 155}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 334}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 863}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
