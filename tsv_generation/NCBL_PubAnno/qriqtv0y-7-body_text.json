To the best of our knowledge , the CaKoV was described in Asia in retrospective study in Korea in 2011 and have been reported in Japan , China and Australia , respectively [ 2 , 15 , 17 , 21 ] . However , the CaKoV have never been reported in the country or South East Asia region . In this study , during the 2 year - survey program , we found CaKoV positivity at 17 . 59 % in both sick ( 19 . 44 % ) and healthy ( 9 . 09 % ) animals . Compare to other studies , CaKoV % positivity in this study was lower than those in China ( 54 % ) and Korea ( 32 . 2 % ) [ 14 , 22 ] . Our result showed that the CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 27 % which consistence with previous reports [ 15 ] . Similar to other previous studies , co - infections with other enteric viral pathogens were observed such as CaKoV / Canine parvovirus and CaKoV / Canine Coronavirus [ 12 , 14 , 15 ] . Moreover , CaKoVs were detected in both diarrheic and non - diarrheic dogs which consistent with other studies [ 2 , 15 ] . Our result supported that this virus may not be the only cause of enteric disease in dogs . Nevertheless , the CaKoV infection have still been identified in symptomatic dogs without other enteric pathogen infections [ 12 ] . Our observation supported that the role of CaKoV as a primary pathogen of acute gastroenteritis remain unclear .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 7, "end": 17}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 106}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 280}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1148, "end": 1164}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1193, "end": 1199}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1381, "end": 1403}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
