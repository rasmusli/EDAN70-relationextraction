There are around 40 antiviral compounds in clinical use targeting various viral diseases ( over half of these drugs are being used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection ) while there is no treatment for most acute infections , such as the ones that cause severe illnesses , including hemorrhagic fever , encephalitis , and even cancer [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Most of the available drugs are of limited efficacy and come with severe side effects [ 6 ] . Importantly , antiviral chemotherapy is plagued by the rapid development of drug resistance strains , resulting from the high rate of replication of viruses combined with the low fidelity with which they replicate their genomes [ 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 90}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 187}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 410}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 425}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 443}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
