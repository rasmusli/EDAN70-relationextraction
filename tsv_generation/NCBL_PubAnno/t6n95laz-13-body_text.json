In the field of CHB , proteomics is not widely performed , presumably due to the mechanism of CHB being so complicated . The aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with CHB and HBV - induced ACLF , respectively , compared with healthy controls using iTRAQ and western blotting . The authors hypothesized that this approach had the potential to ultimately be beneficial for the identification of proteins that were important in the progression of HBV infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 196}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 274}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 392}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 415}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 680}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
