The results showed that the identified RTKs mediated HCV entry by regulating CD81claudin - 1 coreceptor associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion , implying that inhibition of RTK function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of HCV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 560}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
