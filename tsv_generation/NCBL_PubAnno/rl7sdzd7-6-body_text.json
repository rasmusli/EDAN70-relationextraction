The LAMP assay relies on the design of a set of primers that generate stem looped ( hairpin ) structures during the early stage of DNA synthesis . The hairpin structures form because two of the primers used contain , at their 5 ' end , a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site . Displacement primers help the formation of these hairpins at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed , these structures can be copied into a series of DNA fragments containing multiple units of the target sequence under isothermal conditions utilizing the displacement properties of Bst polymerase ( see [ 3 ] ) . Although LAMP was first described using a set of four primers , enhanced sensitivity was reported using an additional pair of loop primers [ 4 ] . As the reactions are performed at a single temperature , LAMP assays can be performed very quickly since there are no separate denaturation , annealing and extension steps , and as such , reactions do not require thermalcyclers . Here we assess the LAMP protocol for the detection of GMOs using primers that target event - specific sequences for transgenic MS8 and RF3 oilseed rape ( Brassica napus L . ) and generic GMO sequences such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter ( P - 35S ) and the promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene ( P - nos and T - nos , respectively ) from Agrobacterium spp .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
