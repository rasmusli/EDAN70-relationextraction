Briefly , monolayers of nearly confluent CEF grown in six - well tissue culture plates ( Sarstedt , N\u00fcrnbrecht , Germany ) were infected with non - recombinant MVA ( clonal isolate MVA F6 ) at 0 . 05 multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) and , 45 min after infection , CEF cells were transfected with plasmid pIIIH5red - MERS - N DNA using X - tremeGENE DNA Transfection Reagent Lipofectamine ( Roche Diagnostics , Penzberg , Germany ) as recommended by the manufacturer . At 48 h after infection , the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant MVA expressing the MERS - CoV N protein was clonally isolated by consecutive rounds of plaque purification in CEF by screening for transient co - expression of the red fluorescent marker protein mCherry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
