Two surveys conducted in pig farms in Belgium , in 2006 [ 73 ] , and 2012 [ 74 ] confirmed that colistin was the most frequently used antimicrobial for the control of PWD , being mostly used prophylactically . However , colistin was underdosed in 90 and 53 % of the cases , in the first and the second survey respectively . In Germany , it was reported that intestinal diseases in weaners were commonly treated with colistin , pigs being treated 9 . 7 days ( median ) per 100 days with this antibiotic , although tetracycline and tylosin were also used in approximately equal amounts [ 75 ] . In a study in France , it was reported that 90 % of pig farms used colistin during the post - weaning period [ 10 ] . In Vietnam , a survey conducted on pig farms representing three different animal production systems ( farm household , semiindustrial and industrial ) showed that colistin was the most commonly used antimicrobial for prevention and therapy of gastrointestinal disorders in pigs [ 76 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 90}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 283}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 490}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
