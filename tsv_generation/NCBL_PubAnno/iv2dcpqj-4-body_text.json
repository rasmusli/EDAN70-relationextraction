CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single - stranded , positive - sense RNA genome of 12 . 3 kb . The RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame ( ORF ) coding for a polyprotein , flanked by a 5 1 - untranslated region ( UTR ) and a 3 1 - UTR . Under cellular and viral protease processing , the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins , including four structural proteins ( C , E rns , E1 and E2 ) and seven nonstructural proteins ( N pro , p7 , NS2 - 3 , NS4A , NS4B , NS5A and NS5B ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . The 5 1 - UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) that is responsible for translation initiation of the viral genome [ 4 ] . The 3 1 - UTR is in charge of regulating the pestiviral genome replication [ 5 , 6 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 28}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 35}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 121}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 161}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
