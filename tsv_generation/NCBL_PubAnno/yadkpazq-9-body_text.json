Purified cells were counted prior to their utilization in the different experiments using the Sysmex XT 2000iV ( Sysmex , Norderstedt , Germany ) as described previously [ 57 ] , and cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I ( Gibco \u00ae , Invitrogen , Basel , Switzerland ) . Adherent CRFK ( ATCC no . CCL - 94 ) and FEA cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I , while adherent fcwf - 4 cells ( ATCC no . CRL - 2787 ) were cultured in EMEM ( ATCC", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
