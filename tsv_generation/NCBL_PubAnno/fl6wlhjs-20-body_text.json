[ 17 ] . Although it is known that anthrax spores can survive for long periods of time in the environment , we consider a small scale scenario . Since the population of interest is the individuals attending children ' s emergency departments , we assume an outbreak that affects a fixed number , N say , of children . Brookmeyer , et al . [ 17 ] define the infection probability of an individual exposed to inhalational anthrax using a competing risk model , modeling the dynamics of spore clearance and germination . Let \u03b8 represent the hazard rate per unit time ( days , say ) that a spore is cleared from the lung and \u03bb be the rate of germination . Suppose that each individual inhales a dose of D spores . Then , the probability that at least one spore germinates is called the attack rate ( AR ) and is calculated using a Poisson approximation , as", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 185}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
