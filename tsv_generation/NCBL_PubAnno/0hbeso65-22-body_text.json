The absence of preventive regiment is a major limitation for patients undergoing LT for HCV - related liver failure . Moreover , accelerated progression to liver cirrhosis after graft reinfection and limited efficacy of IFN - based therapies for recurrent HCV are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the HCV recipients [ 80 ] .
