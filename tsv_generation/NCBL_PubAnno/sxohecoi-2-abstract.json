Acidic genital secretions of HIV - 1 - infected women contain HIV - 1 likely coated by antibody . We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env - specific IgG , including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of HIV - 1 - infected individuals , augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20 - fold compared with Env - specific IgG at neutral pH or non - specific IgG at either pH . Enhanced transcytosis was observed with clinical HIV - 1 isolates , including transmitted / founder strains , and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor ( FcRn ) - knockdown epithelial cells . Non - neutralizing antibodies allowed similar or less transcytosis than neutralizing antibodies . However , the ratio of total : infectious virus was higher for neutralizing antibodies , indicating that they allowed transcytosis while blocking infectivity of transcytosed virus . Immunocytochemistry revealed abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelia lining the human endocervix and penile urethra . Acidity and Env - specific IgG enhance transcytosis of virus across epithelial cells via FcRn and could facilitate translocation of virus to susceptible target cells following sexual exposure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 365}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 599}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
