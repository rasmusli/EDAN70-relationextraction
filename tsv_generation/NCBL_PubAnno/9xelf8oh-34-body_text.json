The use of an endogenous IC has allowed the validation of the use of swabs to detect the target pathogens . The level of a pathogen on a swab not only depends on the pathogen abundance at the site sampled but also on the amount of sample effort . However , it is reasonable to assume that this latter factor will also dictate the amount of reference DNA harvested . Hence , the use of an endogenous IC compensates for any variability in sample effort - a potential confounding factor when using swabs to collect samples . However , caution is required when comparing swabbed material with tissue samples . Relative quantification is the ratio of the target viral DNA ( SQPV / SADV ) to the reference squirrel DNA ( PGK ) . Thus , if the sampling method harvests host cells poorly in comparison to viral particles , then an artificially high viral load may be indicated . This may , in part , explain why arm swabs yielded by far the highest RQ of SQPV in grey squirrels ( Fig . 2 ) . Unsurprisingly , arm swabs show a poorer harvest of squirrel DNA in comparison to other sample types ( Online Resource S10 , Fig . S10 . 1 ) . Yet , in terms of absolute quantities , arm swabs show a proportionally higher number of DNA copies of the SQPV target gene ( Online Resource S10 , Fig . S10 . 1 ) . Therefore , the high levels of SQPV in arm swabs appear genuine , a conclusion supported by the infection levels in skin sampled from the same site in red squirrels ( see Figs . 2 and 3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
