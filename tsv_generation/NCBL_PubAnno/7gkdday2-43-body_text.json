{"cord_uid": "7gkdday2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5367831", "divid": "43", "text": "Age - dependent distribution of respiratory virus data of our study shows that viral infection is mostly concentrated in less than one - year age group particularly RSV as a substantial threat . The frequency of pathogen positive specimens and incidence of coinfections were significantly higher in under - one children , which makes it the most vulnerable age group for ARIs . Additionally , around 87 % ( 54 / 62 ) of the RSV cases were detected in children less than one year of age . The frequency of RSV infections in this age group seems to be a consequence of multifactorial complex events , involving especially immunological factors . Maternal antibodies are a vital means of protection to infants against respiratory viruses as they have a relatively immature immune system to mount an effective immune response . RSV antibodies are found in all adults and children older than three years of age . At one year of age , 25 - 50 % of children have antibodies against RSV , indicating the high frequency of this infection at a young age [ 52 ] and then the incidence of RSV infections decreases with age , probably because of the development of anti - RSV immunity which is boosted during each subsequent re - infection [ 53 ] . Currently , there are no effective antivirals or vaccines against RSV infections . Several RSV vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials and have yet to be licensed [ 54 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 95}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 169}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 376}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 428}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 520}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 715, "end": 735}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 828}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1077, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1302, "end": 1317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1327, "end": 1331}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
