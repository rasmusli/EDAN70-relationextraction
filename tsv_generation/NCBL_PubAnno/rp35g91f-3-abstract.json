This myocardial sleeve is thought to maintain venous pressure and prevent blood reflux from the atrium during contraction ( Nathan and Eliakim 1966 ) . Interestingly , autonomous electrical activity ( Brunton and Fayrer 1876 ) and ectopic beats originating from the pulmonary myocardium ( Chen et al . 1999 ) are implicated in atrial fibrillation . This is important because it has been estimated that atrial fibrillation affects . 33 million people globally ( Chugh et al . 2014 ) . Further , atrial fibrillation is associated with stroke , heart failure , significant morbidity , and increased mortality , leading to an estimated annual cost of $ 6 . 65 billion in the United States in 2005 ( Reynolds and Essebag 2012 ) . A number of studies have attempted to characterize and define the involvement of the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation ( Chen et al .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 578}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 633, "end": 653}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 745}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 771}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 773, "end": 787}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
