Considering that the establishment of innate immune responses by virus - infected cells may also involve the production of chemokines responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection , we measured the gene expression of several chemokines in JEV - infected porcine NEC ( Fig . 6 ) . mRNA expression levels of CCL2 , CCL5 , and CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi compared to those in mock controls ( Fig . 6A to C ) . Nevertheless , for CCL2 , only JEV Laos induced a significant mRNA upregulation at 48 hpi ( Fig . 6A ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 14}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 21}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 366}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
