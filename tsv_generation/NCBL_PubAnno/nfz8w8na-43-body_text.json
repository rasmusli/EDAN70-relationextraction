Jones ( 2014 ) criticizes this Bculturalist epidemiology ^ ( pg . 1 ) that overlooks the wider global forces that promote the spread of Ebola , instead exoticizing Liberian culture to attribute responsibility ( Blair et al . 2017 ) . For example , traditional burial practices and the consumption of bush meat were identified as key etiological factors to the Ebola epidemic . Some analysts even suggest that these cultural practices , in addition to local distrust of authorities may have obstructed interventions ( Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c ; Cordner et al . 2017 ) . Therefore , population behaviors , such as education and safe burials and cremations , were proposed as targets for intervention ( Hagan et al . 2015 ; Alexander et al . 2015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 252}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 476}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
