Stolz et al [ 11 ] . evaluated potential markers of bacterial infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications . They reported that the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the serum procalcitonin concentration are independent predictors of bacterial infection . They suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is 15 % ( sensitivity 84 % ; specificity 77 % ) , which is much lower than the cutoff value in the current study . Sternberg et al . [ 13 ] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing pneumonia in renal transplant patients , and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is . 20 % for predicting bacterial pneumonia . However , neither of these previous studies included patients with severe pneumonia caused by respiratory viruses alone , and both compared BAL findings between patients with bacterial pneumonia and those with non - infectious diseases . In the current study , patients with viral pneumonia were included by using the newly developed multiplex respiratory virus RT - PCR . This showed that cases of viral pneumonia were frequently associated with neutrophilia in BAL fluid ( median 54 . 0 % ) . We speculate that this underlies why the optimal cutoff value of percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid for predicting bacterial pneumonia is much higher in the current study ( 64 % , Table 4 ) than in previous studies . Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells - 1 ( sTREM - 1 ) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilateral lung infiltrates . A cutoff value of $ 60 % neutrophils in BAL fluid is useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia from other causes of pneumonia or non - infectious diseases ( AUC = 0 . 77 , 95 % CI ; 0 . 54 - 0 . 84 , P = 0 . 001 ) [ 12 ] . In comparison to this previous study , the current study did not include patients with non - infectious diseases or fungal pneumonia , included much more cases of severe viral pneumonia , and analyzed the counts of various cell types .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 111}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 214}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 285}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 441}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 732}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 752}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 898}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 994, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1110, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1315}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1360}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1835, "end": 1840}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1944, "end": 1974}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1995, "end": 2005}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 2008, "end": 2034}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 2189, "end": 2215}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 2218, "end": 2235}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 2272, "end": 2288}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
