Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in LRTI and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged < 5 years also in developing countries [ 6 ] . This was confirmed in a WHO - sponsored denominator - based study of RSV - associated LRTI in four developing countries [ 7 ] . Moreover , while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe LRTI in otherwise healthy children in highincome countries [ 8 ] , little information on its epidemiology is available from resource - poor settings . A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published , but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . Seasonality of RSV and influenza in tropical and sub - tropical regions differs from the well - defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates , and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [ 1 , 12 ] . Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures , such as development and introduction of vaccines in low - and middle - income countries .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 235}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 434}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 879}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 883, "end": 893}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
