The conserved sequence C2717 - C2740 - C2742 - C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [ 7 ] . It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B ( viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase [ RdRp ] ) and 3 1 - UTR [ 8 ] . The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , another member of the family Flaviviridae , is an essential component of the replication complex [ 9 ] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [ 10 , 11 ] . The HCV NS5A - Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [ 12 ] . The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [ 13 , 14 ] . In addition , the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES - mediated translation in a dose - dependent manner and the key sites ( K399 , T401 , E406 and L413 ) are also found in BVDV , BDV and HCV [ 15 ] . To date , studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [ 8 , 15 ] , but knowledge of NS5A - interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 430}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 436}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1040}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1046}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1050, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
