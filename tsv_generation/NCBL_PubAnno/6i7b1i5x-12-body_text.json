These were seemingly specific and prominent in seven KD biopsy specimens , however the fourteen control specimens were from autopsies that succumbed generally from non - inflammatory and non - cardiac syndromes . Notably , mature memory and immature B cells ( CD20 + cells ) were lacking [ 83 ] . Due to the late time point of these specimens , this may not be inconsistent with other reports reviewed previously . The lack of CD20 + B cells was theorized to be from early coronary infiltration of CD20 + B cells followed by immediate switching of these B cells to plasma cells [ 84 ] . This increase in infiltrative IgA + plasma cells could not be explained by a generalized increase in peripheral IgA + cell , as none was shown in acute or convalescent KD [ 3 ] . The largest study , relying on electron microscopic studies , suggests that there is an early necrotizing arteritis indicative of an acute viral infection , followed by a vasculitis , then luminal myofibroblast proliferation [ 77 ] . Although this study had 32 samples , it only had three within two weeks of disease onset and a number of findings were different than previous studies . Collection and study of these types of rare samples should continue .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 119}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 259}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 367, "end": 414}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 961}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1063, "end": 1085}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1102, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1140, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
