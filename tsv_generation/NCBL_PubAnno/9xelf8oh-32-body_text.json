A clear benefit is that , since much of the optimisation and validation is carried out in multiplex , there is relatively little additional work required to develop assays that screen for more than one pathogen ; moreover , multiplex reactions increase the amount of data gained from a single sample , and incorporating an endogenous IC into the design provides confidence in the reliability of the ( negative ) results and allows comparison of results across laboratories . Therefore , any disadvantage of additional initial investment into assay development is quickly outweighed by the greater quantity and quality of data produced . Overall , the new assays identified similar findings to the previously published methods . Our SQPV assays and the Atkin et al . ( 2010 ) SYBR \u00ae green assay both identified SQPVas a localised infection in grey squirrels , compared with the generalised , systemic infection in red squirrels . The agreement between available TEM data and our qPCR assays for SADV was moderate ( k value = 0 . 39 ) , but this level of agreement is nonetheless superior to that reported in studies using conventional PCR . Grey squirrel SADV results are reasonably comparable to previous studies reporting infection prevalence of spleen and blood samples as 54 - 57 and 0 - 7 % ( Everest et al . 2014 ) in comparison to 33 and 50 % reported here . The difference in prevalence of SADV in blood samples may reflect the increased sensitivity of the qPCR assay developed , with the level of SADV in blood generally low , and thus potentially overlooked when screening with conventional PCR . However , differences in selection , geography and time of year may also have been responsible for or contributed to the data obtained . In red squirrels , SADV is believed to be an enteric infection although systemic effects are witnessed , with splenitis commonly reported ( Martinez - Jimenez et al . 2011 ; Sainsbury et al . 2001 ) . This is supported by our data , with the gastrointestinal tract , liver , blood and spleen showing the highest intensities and prevalence of SADV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1097, "end": 1104}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1684, "end": 1689}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 2075, "end": 2093}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 2140, "end": 2150}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
