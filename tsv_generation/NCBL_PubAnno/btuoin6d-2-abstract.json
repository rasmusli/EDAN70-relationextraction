However , there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus - positive community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) . Methods : The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed . The patients were divided into three groups , namely , the adenovirus - positive ( Adv ) group , the adenovirus - negative ( Non - Adv ) group and the unknown pathogen group , according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens . We evaluated and compared the demographics , clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups . Results : Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods , 67 were classified into the Adv group , while 134 were classified into the Non - Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group . The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission ( 3 . 2 \u00b1 1 . 6 vs . 1 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 2 vs . 2 . 2 \u00b1 1 . 5 days , P = 0 . 018 ) and symptom onset ( 5 . 8 \u00b1 2 . 2 vs . 3 . 9 \u00b1 2 . 5 vs . 3 . 7 \u00b1 2 . 0 days , P = 0 . 006 ) than patients in the Non - Adv and unknown pathogen groups , respectively . The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission ( 37 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 3 vs . 37 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 3 vs . 37 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 3 , P = 0 . 005 ) , and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40 ( 14 . 9 % vs . 2 . 2 % vs . 4 . 0 % , 35 . 8 % vs . 3 . 7 % vs . 6 . 0 % , P < 0 . 001 ) than those in the Non - Adv and unknown pathogen groups , respectively . The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non - Adv group ( 17 . 9 % vs . 1 . 5 % , 35 . 0 % vs . 4 . 3 % , P < 0 . 001 , P = 0 . 05 , respectively ) . In addition , the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non - Adv group ( 4 . 3 \u00b1 2 . 8 vs . 2 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 8 days , P = 0 . 034 , respectively ) . Furthermore , no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups , and no patient died in either group . Conclusion : In this study , Adv - positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 59}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 302}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 308}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 440}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1050}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1286}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
