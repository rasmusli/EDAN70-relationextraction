The major source of TNF - \u03b1 is the cells of monocyte / macrophage lineage although T lymphocytes , neutrophils and mast cells also produce this pro - inflammatory cytokine . IL - 1\u03b2 is produced by a variety of cells types , including monocytes , macrophages , fibroblasts and endothelial cells [ 103 ] . The production of the pro - inflammatory cytokines may be induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) that is an endotoxin localised on Gram negative bacteria cell walls capable to activate macrophages , stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines [ 104 ] . However , Gram positive bacteria may also contribute to the stimulation in the production of cytokines . Lipoteichoic acid ( LTA ) represents a class of amphiphilic molecules anchored to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram positive bacteria that causes cytokine induction in mononuclear phagocytes and a synergism with peptidoglycan ( PG ) has been described resulting in higher cytokine levels [ 105 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 39}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 146, "end": 169}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
