In short , CAP was diagnosed when the patients had symptoms associated with respiratory tract infections and had new - onset lung infiltration or pleural effusion on chest X - rays or chest computed tomography scans . We defined fever as any temperature greater than or equal to 38 \u00b0 C recorded by the tympanic route . The body temperatures of all patients were checked every hour at admission day . During the days after admission , the body temperature was often measured within 1 h when patients had a febrile sense or worsening signs of inflammation . We also recorded body temperature at the beginning of antipyretics administration . There is no standardized antipyretic treatment protocol for fever control . In our study , antipyretic therapy was administered upon reaching a body temperature \u2265 of 38 \u00b0 C . The interval of antipyretics administration was according to pharmacodynamics , although we performed additional antipyretics treatment when patients had a fever ( two consecutive measurements \u2265 38 \u00b0 C ) and deterioration of clinical symptoms , including myalgia , general weakness , cough , nasal congestion , or dyspnea within 6 h after antipyretics administration . Responsiveness to antipyretic treatment was classified as follows : a complete response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38 \u00b0 C was observed after antipyretics treatment and sustained throughout ; a partial response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38 \u00b0 C was observed but there was a resurge during observation or a need for additional antipyretics ; and no response was recorded when a sustained body temperature above or equal to 38 \u00b0 C was observed after antipyretics use . Unresponsive to initial antibiotic treatment was defined as observed deterioration as evidenced by worsening of clinical symptoms and signs and / or progression of lesions on radiological studies after 48 to 72 h of initial antibiotics treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 157}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 285}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 305}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 377}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1113, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1220}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1239}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1241, "end": 1247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1279}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
