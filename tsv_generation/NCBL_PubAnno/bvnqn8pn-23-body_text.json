The existence of seasonal cycles of asthma exacerbations is well established [ 7 , 14 , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . Children frequently experience a worsening of asthma when they return to school after the summer break ; the peak of this \" September asthma epidemics \" is around 2 weeks after the start of school [ 7 , 14 , 16 ] . In 2006 , Johnston and Sears examined data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and found a clear seasonal pattern in ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma , showing , for the 5 - 15 years ' age group , a relatively stable trend for the first 6 months of the year , a trough in the summer months , and then a rapid and substantial increase in mid - August , reaching the peak 2 weeks after return to school ; in children aged 2 - 4 , the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [ 16 ] . More recently , Cohen et al . analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for asthma were fluctuating during the first part of the year , had a decline in the summer months , and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [ 7 ] . Similarly to what is reported in the literature , our data show an increase in ED visits for asthma in early autumn , but with a difference between children aged 0 - 5 and \u2265 6 years ( Figure 4 ) . In the younger group , the peak starts in September , reaches its maximum in October , and then continues for the whole autumn and early winter . In the school - aged children , there is a peak only in September which is , however , lower than that observed during the spring , mainly in April and May .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 59}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 180}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 268}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 515}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 918}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1012, "end": 1019}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1269}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
