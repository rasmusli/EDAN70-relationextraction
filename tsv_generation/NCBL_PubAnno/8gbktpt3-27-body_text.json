{"cord_uid": "8gbktpt3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6950618", "divid": "27", "text": "Histopathology of the small intestine was performed in six cases , including five in which samples were collected for PCR and sequencing ( Table 4 ) . In four of these , lesions of mild enteritis ( n = 3 ) or fibrosis of the lamina propria ( n = 1 ) were present . In one case ( 221 , Table 3 ) , histological lesions were typical of FPL ( Figure 5 ) , with multiple sections of jejunum and ileum showing mild multifocal loss and replacement of crypts by karyorrhectic and cellular debris ( necrosis ) and low - to - moderate numbers of neutrophils within the lamina propria . Low numbers of the remaining crypts were variably lined by degenerate or necrotic epithelium with intraluminal degenerate neutrophils , debris and sloughed necrotic epithelial cells ( crypt abscesses ) . Neutrophils frequently invaded the remaining crypt epithelium . Rare epithelial cells contained 4 - 6 \u00b5m - diameter polygonal - to - ovoid , eosinophilic - to - amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies that occasionally marginated the chromatin . There was moderate multifocal crypt regeneration , and crypts were frequently lined by large epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei that were piled up or in mitosis . Intestinal lymphoid tissue appeared mildly depleted . The morphological diagnosis was moderate diffuse acute neutrophilic enteritis with crypt necrosis , epithelial regeneration and rare intranuclear viral inclusions . These findings were consistent with FPV / CPV infection . ( Table 4 ) . Of the cases where sections of mesenteric lymph nodes ( n = 3 ) or thymus ( n = 1 ) were available , lesions of mild follicular lymphoid depletion were present in one case , which was the same animal with small intestinal lesions consistent with FPV ( case 221 ) . Affected cortical follicles were small and poorly populated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 196}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 240}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 334, "end": 338}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1333, "end": 1348}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1451, "end": 1455}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1457, "end": 1471}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1604, "end": 1634}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1692, "end": 1717}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1733, "end": 1737}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
