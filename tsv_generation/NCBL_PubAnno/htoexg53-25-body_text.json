The development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant viral antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the MERS - CoV infection . Recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic MERS - CoV infection in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of MERS [ 52 , 53 ] . Since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of MERS - CoV infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity , the analysis of MERS - CoV - specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention . Moreover , in order to characterize the pathogenesis of MERS - CoV infection , it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus - specific T cells in animal models of MERS and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these T cell responses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 340}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 423}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 518}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 607}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 866, "end": 887}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 987}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
