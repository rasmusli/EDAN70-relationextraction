In virus - producing cells , IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles . Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells . This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
