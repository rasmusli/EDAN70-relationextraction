This relies on the assumption that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected . This is not the case for all livestock diseases . For example , animals infected with bTB can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months [ 13 ] before becoming infectious . The model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of this nature , and further work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow - spreading diseases such as bTB , where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 69}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 350}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 651}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
