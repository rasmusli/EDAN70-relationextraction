Embryonic fibroblasts inoculated with PUUV did not express increased amounts of Ifn\u03b2 or Mx2 , although non - related viruses were able to induce up - regulation of these genes . This suggests , as with SEOV , PUUV efficiently antagonizes host innate responses in its natural reservoir .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
