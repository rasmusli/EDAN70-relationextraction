Therefore , one approach to support critically ill patients is intravenous administration of IgM - enriched immunoglobulins since this could potentially decrease the severity of inflammation . Although this treatment was omitted in recent sepsis guidelines due to a lack of supporting evidence in high - quality trials [ 8 ] , several studies , including one meta - analysis , describe beneficial effects of immunoglobulins in acute pneumonia induced by drug - resistant bacterial infections [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . Furthermore , several case reports describe beneficial effects of antiviral therapy in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in immune - compromised patients [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . Based on these data , we treated patients with ARDS requiring ECMO therapy with IgM - enriched immunoglobulins immediately after intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . The objective of this study was to investigate whether intravenous immunoglobulin administration could improve the clinical course of ARDS in patients treated with ECMO . Therefore , mortality , the duration of ECMO therapy , the incidence of renal replacement therapy , the duration of vasopressor and anti - infective therapy , length of stay in the ICU , and length of stay in the hospital were analyzed retrospectively in 57 ARDS patients requiring ECMO therapy .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 205}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 459}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 656}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 705}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 876}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 974}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1230}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1520, "end": 1525}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
