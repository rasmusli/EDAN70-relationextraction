The first - round PCR primers were AdTU7 ( 5 0 - GCCACCTTCTTCCCCATGGC - 3 0 ) and AdTU4 0 ( 5 0 - GTAGCGTTGCCGGCCGAGAA - 3 0 ) with 1004 bp PCR product ; the second - round primers were AdnU - S 0 ( 5 0 - TTCCCCATGGCC - CACAACAC - 3 0 ) and AdnU - A ( 5 0 - GCCTCGATGACGCCGCGGTG - 3 0 ) with 956 bp PCR product . The PCR reactions contained 1 . 25 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase , 10 \u00d7 PCR Buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 ( Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc . , Mannheim , Germany ) , 0 . 5 \u03bcM of each primer , 200 \u03bcM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate ( i . e . , dATP , dGTP , dCTP , dTTP ; TaKaRa , Shiga , Japan ) , and 5 \u03bcL nucleic acids ( first round ) or 2 \u03bcL first - round PCR product ( second round ) as a template in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL . PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0 C for 10 min , followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0 C for 1 min , annealing at 50 \u00b0 C for 1 min , and extension at 72 \u00b0 C for 2 min . The final step was an extension at 72 \u00b0 C for 7 min . The second round of PCR was conducted using the same PCR conditions described above for the first round .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 85}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
