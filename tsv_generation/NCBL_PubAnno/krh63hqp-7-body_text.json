These code for up to eleven distinct proteins , two with alternate reading frames and one through alternate splicing . Each of the eight RNA segments has its own history of reassortment , inheritance , and mutation [ 5 ] . In the same way , each of the major serotypes ( e . g . , H1N1 , H2N2 , H3N2 ) has its own rate of mutation and history of reassortment . Almost all of the influenza genome is protein coding , and 5 . 7 % ( 749 nucleotides ) of the genome codes for two protein products simultaneously ( Table 1 ) . Currently , there are thousands of fully - sequenced influenza genomes available in public databases , including a reconstructed version of a 1918 H1N1 genome . Most of these have collection dates and lineage information associated with them . Given this large body of data , it becomes feasible to test the attenuation model using mutation accumulation rates , non - synonymous amino acid changes , changing dN / dS ratios , changing transition / transversions ratios , and changes in codon specificity over time .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 478}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 674}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
