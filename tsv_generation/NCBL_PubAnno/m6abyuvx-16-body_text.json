These results indicated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were not responsible for the rVV - N25 - induced amelioration of histological findings and that other inflammatory cell types may play an as - yet - unidentified role in the resolution of the pathological changes in these mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 182}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
