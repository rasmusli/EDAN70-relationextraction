There is only two preferred codons UUG ( Leu ) and GUG ( Val ) , choosing G at the third position , and most of preferred codons are ended with A ( Table 3 ) . The values of ENC among these polioviruses ORFs are similar , which vary from 52 . 609 to 55 . 105 with a mean value of 53 . 754 and S . D . of 0 . 545 . The data showed that the extent of codon preference in polioviruses genes was kept basically stable .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 71}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 127}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
