In humans , these viruses are etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ; SEOV , PUUV ) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( HCPS ; SNV ) [ 1 ] . These diseases share many pathologic similarities and because little damage to the endothelium occurs during infection , it is thought that the inflammatory immune response contributes to pathogenesis [ 17 , 18 ] . Because the Norway rat is a model organism with many specific reagents , including monoclonal antibodies to immune markers , significant progress has been made toward understanding the reservoir host immune response to SEOV [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Fewer methods and reagents are available for bank voles and deer mice . Despite these limitations , emerging technologies will be useful for understanding why rodent reservoirs are infected without disease and why they are unable to clear infection . A significant limitation of HFRS research is that none of the HFRS - causing hantaviruses cause disease in animal models . However , two New World hantaviruses cause an HCPS - like disease in Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) : Andes virus ( ANDV ) and Maporal virus ( MAPV ) [ 22 , 23 ] . ANDV causes most HCPS cases in South America ; however , no human cases of disease have been associated with MAPV . ANDV is hosted by the long - tailed pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys longicaudatus ) and MAPV is hosted by the delicate pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys delicatus ) [ 24 , 25 ] . ANDV is considered an animal biosafety level - 4 pathogen in most nations , whereas MAPV is considered an ABSL - 3 virus [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 131}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 213}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 286}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 436}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 456}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 470}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 477}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 519}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 526}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 532}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1576, "end": 1581}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1668, "end": 1673}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
