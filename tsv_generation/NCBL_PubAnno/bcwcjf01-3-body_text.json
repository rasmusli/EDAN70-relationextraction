RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica and has reservoirs in terrestrial species as well as bats ( Chiroptera ) . Although vaccination and antibody therapy is effective in treating known exposures to RABV , an estimated 55 , 000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries [ 1 ] . RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus , family Rhabdoviridae . The genome is composed of negative - sense single - stranded RNA , about 12 kb in size which codes for five proteins - nucleoprotein ( N ) , phosphoprotein ( P ) , matrix protein ( M ) , glycoprotein ( G ) and polymerase ( L ) . Like other RNA viruses , RABV has a high mutation rate due to the high error rate of the polymerase , thus populations of RABV exist as a mutant swarm , or quasispecies [ 2 ] . RABV evolution is believed to be driven predominantly by purifying selection and RABV is not known to recombine [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
