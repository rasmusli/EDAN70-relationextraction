{"cord_uid": "1bi6q127", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6410205", "divid": "14", "text": "Over the past few years , numerous viruses have been detected in bats and these viruses seldom cause any overt disease ( with the exception of Tacaribe virus and rabies virus ) [ 1 , 16 , 37 ] . Detection of virus and absence of disease have led researchers to suggest that bats are likely the reservoirs of these viruses . Asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as henipaviruses ( Nipah and Hendra viruses ) , coronaviruses ( Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) ) , and filoviruses ( Marburg virus and ebolaviruses ) [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] . For a species to be a viral reservoir , the virus needs to persist in the population . Two probable ways in which this can happen are ( 1 ) virus infection and clearing from infected individuals is an ongoing process and introduction of na\u00efve individuals maintains the virus in the population and ( 2 ) individuals infected with the virus are able to maintain the virus in the form of a persistent infection . Although either or both of these possibilities may influence the bat - virus relationship , there is considerable evidence for the maintenance of some viruses in bat populations by continued , low - level persistence .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 158}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 175}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 417}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 462}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 512}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 525}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 535, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 563}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 567, "end": 580}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
