Proteins were designated as differentially expressed proteins ( DEPs ) if they had expression fold - change ratios \u2265 1 . 2 or \u2264 0 . 833 and the p - value was less than 0 . 05 . By two statistical methods , we identified 615 DEPs during the entire infection process by method 1 and 437 DEPs for all five time points by method 2 ( Fig . 2c ) . As shown in Fig . 2a1 , a2 , a total of 679 DEPs were identified by combining the two selection methods , which was greater than the number identified by each of the individual methods . Among the 679 DEPs , 373 proteins were identified by both methods .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
