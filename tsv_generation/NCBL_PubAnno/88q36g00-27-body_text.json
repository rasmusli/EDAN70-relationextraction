Total RNA from the astrocyte cultures was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) . The RT reaction with 100 ng of total RNA was carried out with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit ( ReverTra Ace ; Toyobo Co . , Ltd , Osaka , Japan ) . The expression levels of mRNAs encoding TNF - \u03b1 , IL - 1\u03b2 , and IL - 6 were evaluated by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) using the Thermal Cycler Dice ( Takara Bio Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) and SYBRII Premix Ex Taq ( Takara Bio Inc . ) reagents . Primers for qRT - PCR are listed in Table 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
