Another sequence in this clade was from a 14 - week - old stray kitten with vomiting , diarrhoea and failure to gain weight . The kitten , from a shelter in Melbourne , had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine . It also tested positive on a multiplex qPCR faecal panel for Giardia spp . and Canine protoparvovirus 1 . The third sequence was from an owned 8 - week - old kitten in Sydney with acute onset vomiting and diarrhoea , vaccinated 3 days before ( vaccine type unknown ) . Of the two closely related VP2 sequences , one ( FPV _ 260 ) was from a 10 - week - old kitten vaccinated 4 days before with the same vaccine strain , which presented for diarrhoea , vomiting and lethargy . It also tested positive for Giardia spp . on a faecal antigen test . The other ( FPV _ 254 ) was from an unvaccinated stray 8 - month - old cat that presented with vomiting , diarrhoea and anorexia and tested positive on a faecal CPV antigen test . Finally , two other Australian sequences - FPV 193 / 170 and Tasmania / 2010 - did not fall into a distinct clade but were relatively closely related to each other and to the vaccine cluster ( clade D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 206}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 554}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 568}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 793, "end": 803}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 814}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 827}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 1002}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
