{"cord_uid": "34xdjzvv", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3728341", "divid": "5", "text": "To this end , we recently have successfully developed transgenic mice carrying the known human EV71 receptor , scavenger receptor class B member 2 ( SCARB2 ) [ 11 , 12 ] . The HFMD - like skin rashes were observed in transgenic mice pre - infected with clinical isolates E59 ( genotype B4 of EV71 ) and N2838 ( B5 ) ; severe limb paralysis and death in transgenic mice pre - inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 ( C2 ) , N3340 ( C4 ) and coxsackievirus A16 ( CVA16 ) [ 11 ] . EV71 viral loads in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pro - inflammatory mediators ( CXCL10 , CCL3 , TNF - a , and IL - 6 ) , correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that resulted in severe diseases in transgenic mice [ 11 ] . It was also observed in EV71 patients with encephalitis associated with PE that have a higher mortality rate ( 64 . 3 % ) than patients with brainstem encephalitis ( 26 . 3 % ) [ 13 , 14 ] , PE might be caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from brainstem lesions caused by the excessive release of IL - 6 , TNF - a , IL - 1b , and IFN - c [ 13 , 15 , 16 ] . In this study , we investigate whether the hSCARB2 - transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 - specific neutralizing antibody , N3 [ 17 ] . Administration of N3 to transgenic mice reduced the developed hair loss and scurfy skin as well as limb paralysis induced by E59 infection and protected from severe limb paralysis resulting in death by 5746 infection . This protection associates with the reduction of the viral load in the brain , spinal cords , and limb muscles . It also associated with the reduction of the secreted proinflammatory mediators in tissues . These results demonstrated N3 might have potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of EV71 - induced severely HFMD patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 181}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 200}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 340}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 795}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 814}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 903}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 930, "end": 933}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 972}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1405, "end": 1415}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1442, "end": 1457}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1508, "end": 1523}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1895, "end": 1900}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
