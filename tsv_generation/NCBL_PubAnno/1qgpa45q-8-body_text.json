The genomes were generated by sequencing overlapping PCR amplicons spanning the entire genome . These are the first reported complete genome sequences of locally circulating HMPV strains obtained directly from clinical samples in Africa . We also combined the new genomes with publicly available sequences to examine patterns in global HMPV genetic diversity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
