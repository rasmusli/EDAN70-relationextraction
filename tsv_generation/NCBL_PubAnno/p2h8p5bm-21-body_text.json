The particular PRR involved in the recognition of the pathogen depends on the infecting virus [ 108 ] . In flavivirus infection , the most important PRRs are Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) 3 , TLR7 , TLR8 , retinoic acid - inducible gene I ( RIG - I ) , and melanoma differentiation - associated protein - 5 ( MDA - 5 ) . TLR3 recognizes double stranded ( ds ) RNA , which is formed as an intermediate during flavivirus replication [ 113 , 114 ] . TLR7 and 8 , which are located in the endosomes , recognize single stranded ( ss ) RNAs , such as the genomic RNA of flaviviruses [ 95 , [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] . RIG - I and MDA - 5 recognize viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells ; RIG - I recognizes short dsRNA and 5 triphosphorylated and 5 diphosphorylated ssRNA , whereas MDA - 5 recognizes long dsRNA [ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 255}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 402}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 555}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
