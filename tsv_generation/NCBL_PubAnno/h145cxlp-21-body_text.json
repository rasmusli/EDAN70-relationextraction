Four of these children suffered both from severe neurological conditions ( two children with previous peripartal asphyxia and spastic tetraparesis ; one child with cerebral paresis and tetraspasticity ; one child with congenital cerebral disorder ) , and from chronic pulmonary conditions ; two of these four children were also born pre - term . Influenza - associated pneumonia was diagnosed in all four of these children ; three additionally had secondary bacterial pneumonia , and one child also developed sepsis . For the fifth child , obesity was reported as the only risk factor ; and sepsis and suspected encephalitis as complications . Bacterial co - pathogens were detected in three of these five children and suspected in one child ; two viral and two fungal co - infections were also reported . All five children received intratracheal ventilation , antibiotics and catecholamines ; two were additionally treated with antiviral medication . Death occurred 1 , 2 , 4 , 19 , and 26 days after PICU admission , with ARDS reported as cause of death in three children . Sequelae were reported for five patients ( 10 . 6 % ) : state after surgery due to pleural effusion / empyema in two children ; increased oxygen requirements in two children who had previously already received oxygen therapy at home ; damage of the lung after high - pressure ventilation in one child . Table 2 ) . Figure 1 shows the difference in age distribution between both seasons , and the high proportion of children below 2 years of age as opposed to low proportions in all other age groups in season 3 . After onset of symptoms , children were admitted to a PICU after a significantly shorter period , with a median of 3 days ( IQR 1 - 4 ) in season 1 compared to 6 days ( IQR 2 . 0 - 7 . 5 ) in season 3 ( Table 2 ) . In season 1 , significantly fewer children were diagnosed with bronchitis / bronchiolitis ( Table 4 ) , and they tended to require CPAP treatment less frequently than in season 3 ( 11 . 1 % vs . 41 . 7 % , p = 0 . 084 , Table 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 207}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 256}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 281}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 315}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 335}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 381}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 423}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 513}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 612}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 643, "end": 650}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 682}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 732}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1163}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1293, "end": 1310}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1312, "end": 1320}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1445, "end": 1464}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 2001, "end": 2012}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 2014, "end": 2028}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
