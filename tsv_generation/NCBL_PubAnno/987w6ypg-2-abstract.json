In all these cases , the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM proteins present in target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 238}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 256}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 271}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 283}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
