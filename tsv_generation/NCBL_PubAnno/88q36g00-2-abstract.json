We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H 2 attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation , including induced pro - inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation , in the fetal brain . Short - term memory , sociability and social novelty , and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y - maze , threechamber , and prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) tests , respectively , at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks . The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis . Offspring of the LPS - exposed dams showed deficits in short - term memory and social interaction , following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex . Maternal H 2 administration markedly attenuated these LPS - induced abnormalities . Moreover , we evaluated the effect of H 2 on LPS - induced astrocytic activation , both in vivo and in vitro . The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS - exposed offspring , but decreased in the offspring of H 2 - administered dams . In primary cultured astrocytes , LPS - induced pro - inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H 2 administration . Overall , these findings indicate that maternal H 2 administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA - induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 359}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 381}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1040}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1588, "end": 1616}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
