Numerous studies show that after an antigenic challenge , vaccination and natural infections , B cells transitioning to plasma cells , termed plasmablasts ( PBs ) , can be seen in the peripheral blood [ 130 , 131 ] . These can be recognized by surface markers of CD19 , downregulation of CD20 , and high levels of CD27 and CD38 [ 3 , 132 ] . In comparison to the general circulating B cell population , PBs are enriched for B cells that contain infection - specific antibodies [ 133 , 134 ] . This is variable as some studies show massive and high enrichment of PBs targeting the antigen of interest [ 135 , 136 ] , while other studies show polyspecificity of the PB population and limited enrichment [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] . Immunization studies in adults ( tetanus [ 141 ] , influenza [ 132 ] , and rabies [ 142 ] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment for specific antibodies , temporally peak 5 - 10 days after immunization , and are predictive of later sero - immunity [ 143 ] . Elevated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections , as they are elevated in a number of autoimmune diseases and their levels correlate to disease flares [ 144 ] . Although certain infections , such as dengue virus , may set off exceedingly high PB levels [ 145 ] , PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post - infection . This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying inflammatory disease , and specifically correlates with c - reactive protein ( CRP ) level in studies on ulcerative colitis [ 145 , 146 ] and IGG4 related disease [ 147 , 148 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 431}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 580}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 994}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1650, "end": 1671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1673, "end": 1677}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 71}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 101}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 879}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 899}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 920}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1317, "end": 1330}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1430, "end": 1452}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1594, "end": 1615}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1699, "end": 1718}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1736, "end": 1757}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 12, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 20, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
