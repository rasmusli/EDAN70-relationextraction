Sequence data were generated by two different platforms ( Illumina and 454 ) and by three different commercial services to determine reproducibility . For 40 of the samples , approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform ( the remaining 4 samples were sequenced using the 454 platform only ) . Average coverage was 17 , 4486 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 383}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 69}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 591}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
