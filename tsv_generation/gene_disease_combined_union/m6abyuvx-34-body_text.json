The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [ 40 ] . R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1 - Cre transgenic mice ( purchased from Jackson Laboratory ) to produce R6CN2HCV - MxCre and R6CN5HCV - MxCre transgenic mice , which were designated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) and RzCN5 - 15 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice , respectively . Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid - polycytidylic acid [ poly ( I : C ) ] ( GE Healthcare UK Ltd . , Buckinghamshire , England ) ; 300 mL of a poly ( I : C ) solution ( 1 mg / mL in phosphate - buffered saline [ PBS ] ) was injected three times at 48 - h intervals . All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 15}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 49, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 80}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 343}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 446}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 507, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 186}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
