In the best characterized system , poliovirus , the capacity of PCBPs to associate at two discrete genomic RNA locations and in concert with different protein partners is critical to almost all aspects of the virus replication cycle ( reviewed in Ref . 57 ) . Whether such complex regulatory circuits operate during PRRSV replication and transcription remains to be determined . PCBP2 has been shown to associate with the 5 untranslated region of the PRRSV genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation ( 34 , 35 ) . Furthermore , the relative abundance and location of PCBPs in the cytoplasm of infected cells could be important in determining the precise ratio of non - frameshifted ( full - length nsp2 ) and trans - frame ( nsp2TF , nsp2N ) products at various stages of the replication cycle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 518, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 583}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 855, "end": 874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 922}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 596}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
