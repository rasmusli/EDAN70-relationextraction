{"cord_uid": "0pmo3opx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5431086", "divid": "8", "text": "In agreement with prior P1 specificity profiling using single - amino acid fluorogenic substrates 5 , hAPN displayed broad specificity at the P1 position . In particular , hAPN exhibited a significant preference for P1 hydrophobic residues ( such as norleucine , leucine , tryptophan , and alanine ) , whereas proline , asparagine , and acidic residues ( aspartic acid and glutamic acid ) were significantly disfavored . We note that norleucine is used as an isostere for methionine in the MSP - MS library . Inspection of individual peptide cleavage events within the MSP - MS time course supported these overarching P1 specificity preferences with N - terminal cleavages being impaired or blocked by disfavored residues at the P1 ( or neo - P1 ) position ( Fig . 1C and Supplemental Figure 2 ) . In shown ; \" n \" is norleucine ) . Residues with a positive percent difference are considered favorable at a given position ; residues with a negative percent difference are considered disfavorable . ( B ) Heat map representation of hAPN P1 - P4 \u2032 specificity at the 60 min assay time point calculated using Z - scores at each position . Favored residues are colored blue ( Z - score > 0 ) and disfavored residues are colored red ( Z - score < 0 ) . iceLogo representations and heat maps for the 15 , 240 , and 1200 min assay time points are provided ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . ( C ) Example 14 - mer peptides from the MSP - MS library are shown with primary and secondary cleavages indicated with a blue arrow . \" X \" indicates that no cleavage was detected at the indicated position . A progress curve is provided depicting the total cleavages observed at each assay time point .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 490, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 621}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 746}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
