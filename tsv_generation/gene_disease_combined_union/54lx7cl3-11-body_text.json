Streptococcus pneumoniae , the leading cause of pneumonia [ 39 ] , is characterized by over 90 serotypes differentiated by variations in the bacterial polysaccharide capsule [ 40 , 41 ] and associated with different propensities of invasive potential [ 42 ] . In addition to protecting against phagocytosis , the capsule prevents clearance by mucous secretion and restricts autolysis [ 43 ] . Other species , including S . aureus , release anti - opsonizing proteins and possess surface protein A to evade phagocytosis . Furthermore , S . aureus secretes leukotoxins that lyse leukocytes and express superantigens that hinder immune response ( reviewed by Naber et al .
