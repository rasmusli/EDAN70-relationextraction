It appears as an icosahedral capsid that encloses a single - strand DNA genome that is 5 . 2 kb long . CPV replicates without the use of a helper virus and hence is called autonomous , but it utilises the machinery and components of host cells , including DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase \u0399 \u0399 for DNA replication and RNA transcription , respectively . Consequently , CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1 , 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 146, "end": 173}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 386}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
