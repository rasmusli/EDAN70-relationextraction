The results of the new assays were compared with the SQPV PCR assay ( Atkin et al . 2010 ) and TEM methods used to identify SADV ( Everest et al . 2008 ) . In the absence of a gold standard for both target pathogens , a test of agreement ( Pfeiffer 2010 ) was performed to compare whether the assays similarly reported presence or absence of virus . When comparing qPCR assays , the quantitative values were investigated for correlation using a Pearson ' s correlation . All statistical analyses ( including generating figures ) were performed using R v . 2 . 15 . 1 ( R Core Team 2012 ) . Where quoted , all confidence intervals ( CI ) are at the 95 % level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 145}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 179}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
