Enzymatically active APN has been documented to play import roles in tumorigenesis , angiogenesis , cell migration , and metastasis 7 - 9 . As a result of its role in cancer development and metastasis , APN has been a major target for drug development . The direct enzymatic activity of APN has been targeted using the potent transition - state analogue inhibitor bestatin ( ubenimex ) in several clinical trials 8 , 10 . Although bestatin inhibits nearly a dozen aminopeptidases , it has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in acute myeloid leukemia , gastric cancer , and squamous cell lung carcinomas [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Other small molecule inhibitors of APN , including the natural product curucumin , have been developed and are undergoing testing in the clinic and preclinical models 10 . As with bestatin , specificity has plagued these next - generation compounds due to the limited interactions small molecules can make with the APN pharmacophore . Additional strategies for the therapeutic targeting of APN have utilized tumor - homing peptides based on the NGR motif that bind to APN and deliver", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 16}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 175}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 357}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 813}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1089, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1164, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1242, "end": 1246}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 3, "end": 10}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 324}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 351}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 698}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 715}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 751}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1089, "end": 1093}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 12, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
