To test this in the mosquito system , Hsu cells were pre - treated with MG132 at various concentrations ( 0 . 1 , 1 and 10 \u03bcM ) , infected with WNV ( MOI 10 ) at 4 \u00b0 C for 30 min and then incubated at 30 \u00b0 C . Real - time RT - qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 6 hpi showed no significant effect of MG132 treatment , indicating that the proteasome does not play a role during WNV entry to Culex cells ( Fig 2C ) . To determine whether the proteasomal pathway plays significant role post - entry , cells were infected with WNV and treated with 10 \u03bcM MG132 from 2 , 4 , or 6 hpi . Real - time RT - qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 48 hpi showed ~ 80 % reduction in viral RNA in all treated samples ( Fig 2D ) . Experiments were also performed to rule out significant contribution by extracellular viral RNA in real time RT - qPCR results ( S2 Fig ) . These results suggest involvement of the proteasomal pathway post - viral entry , possibly during viral transcription .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 925}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1057}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 149}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 327}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 595}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 741}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
