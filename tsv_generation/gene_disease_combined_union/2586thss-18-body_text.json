A total of 300 samples was measured using the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and anti - HCV ELISA immunoassays . In these 300 cases , we found that the rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and the ELISA - negative one was 78 % ( 234 / 300 ) . The rate of anti - HCV DAS - LFIA - negative but ELISA - positive was 2 % ( 6 / 300 ) . The rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA - positive strip but the ELISAnegative one was 3 . 67 % ( 11 / 300 ) . The rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA and ELISA - positive was 16 . 33 % ( 49 / 300 ) . The concordance between the ELISA and DAS - LFIA methods was 94 . 33 % .
