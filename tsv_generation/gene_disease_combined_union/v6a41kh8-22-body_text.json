In each of the three years , we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of pneumonia at the end of the monsoon season in August to September . There were also significant CAP epidemics during winter , the first year peaking in February and the second year in December , but we observed no winter epidemic in the third year . There were also smaller peaks of CAP in spring . Epidemics of infection with individual respiratory viruses contributed to literally all of these CAP epidemics , such as the three RSV epidemics ( the second of which was compounded by epidemics with InfA and InfB infections ) , an InfA epidemic superimposed on an hMPV epidemic , and a PIV3 epidemic ( Figure 3 ) . Displays of the spatial - temporal distribution of these individual epidemics are visualized in [ 24 ] . PIV1 infections occurred in small numbers throughout the year , whereas only 17 cases of PIV2 infection were seen during the entire study period .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 22}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 227}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 504}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 617}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 651}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 725}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
