Hence , the idea to develop neutralizing mouse mAbs as a strategy to prevent the entry of MERS - CoV into host cells was led by Du et al . [ 75 ] . mAbs were made by vaccinating mice with IgG1 Fc to which recombinant MERS - CoV S1 was fused [ 75 ] . Consequently , Mersmab1 , the most effective murine mAb was developed that targeted MERS - CoV RBD , and successfully neutralized MERS - CoV infection in Vero E6 , Huh - 7 and Calu - 3 cells [ 76 ] . These studies indicated the potential of humanized mAbs as efficient curative agents against infection caused by MERS - CoV . Around April 2014 , three independent studies first reported to have developed complete humanized MERS - CoV neutralizing mAbs [ 77 , 78 ] . All these humanized mAbs specifically targeted the MERS - CoV RBD glycoprotein . The efficacy of human mAbs against MERS - CoV infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al . [ 79 ] . They were able to completely treat MERS - CoV infection of lethal nature with a single dose of humanized mAbs in the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [ 79 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 342}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 495}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 695}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 892}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 916, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 957, "end": 985}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1003, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 580}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1022, "end": 1033}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1133}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T15", "obj": 18, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
