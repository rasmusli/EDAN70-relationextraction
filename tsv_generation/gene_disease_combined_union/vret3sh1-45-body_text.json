The subsystems strategy , adopted as the guiding principle of the effort [ 16 ] , centers on leveraging expert annotations to define a small set of functional roles in all genomes rather than all the functional roles in a small number of genomes . 2 . The subsystem effort provided a convenient framework for the curation of a set of protein families that became known as FIGfams [ 22 , 23 ] , intended to contain only isofunctional homologsthat is , each family was intended to contain only homologous proteins playing the same functional role . When errors in FiGfams are detected , the underlying subsystems are updated and then the FIGfams are regenerated to correct those errors . The rapid evolution of the FIGfam collection has made possible a number of the services described in this article . 3 . Using subsystems and FIGfams as the underlying technology , the RAST server was developed and made available in 2007 [ 23 ] . Thousands of viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated with the RAST system , and hundreds more are being annotated each week . 4 . The high - quality annotations generated by RAST together with the ability to manually modify those annotations by human experts allowed for the automatic generation of genome - scale metabolic models in the Model SEED [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 574}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 648}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 717, "end": 724}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 816, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 879}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1013}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1125}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
