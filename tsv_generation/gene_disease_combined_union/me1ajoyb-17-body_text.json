The expression of immune response genes differed in the spleen , where signatures of inflammation occurred within two days , peaking by days 10 to 15 before subsiding , and lungs , where little immune gene expression occurred [ 13 ] . Some deer mice produced nucleocapsid - specific IgG by day 10 while others had IgG around day 20 or later , and neutralizing antibody was not detected until after 3 weeks . . During acute infection , SNV elicits a modest inflammatory response that initially limits , but does not clear , virus . Within a few weeks , the response transitions to a regulatory response that may allow episodic recrudescence of virus that can be shed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 183}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 457}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 543}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 574}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 695}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
