HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide , and end - stage liver disease caused by HCV has increasingly become the leading indication for liver transplantation ( LT ) . It has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by HCV RNA detection using the polymerase chain reaction occurs almost universally [ 1 ] . The natural history of HCV reinfection is substantially changed after LT with accelerated rate of cirrhosis recurrence of 8 - 44 % in 5 - 7 years [ 2 ] . It has been pointed out that HCV reinfects the liver graft at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ] . The virus source is attributed to the blood itself with a high probability [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 192}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 230}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 272}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 286}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 359}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 552}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 633}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
