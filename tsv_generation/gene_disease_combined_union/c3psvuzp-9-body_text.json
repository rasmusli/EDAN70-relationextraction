The identification of candidate immunity genes and mechanisms is a key step in describing this repertoire . Despite advances in genome sequencing , identification of antiviral genes has largely remained dependent on demonstration of their activity against candidate viruses . However , antiviral proteins that directly interact with viral targets or antagonists also bear signatures of recurrent evolutionary adaptation , which can be used to identify candidate antivirals . Here , we find that five out of seventeen genes that contain a domain that can catalyze the post - translational addition ADP - ribose to proteins bear such signatures of recurrent genetic innovation . In particular , we find that all the genes that encode both ADP - ribose addition ( via PARP domains ) as well as recognition and / or removal ( via macro domains ) activities have evolved under extremely strong diversifying selection in mammals . Furthermore , such genes have undergone multiple episodes of gene duplications and losses throughout mammalian evolution . Combined with the knowledge that some viruses also encode macro domains to counteract host immunity , our evolutionary analyses therefore implicate ADP - ribosylation as an underappreciated key step in antiviral defense in mammalian genomes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 183}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 976}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1242, "end": 1256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1407, "end": 1425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 21}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
