To this end , we treated Veros with 500 \u00b5M DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h . Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ) . In untreated cells , we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3 - 2A 29K , - 3C 52R , or double protease mutant . However , with DFMO treatment , eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection , as previously observed ( Figure 4A ) . When we analyzed DFMO - treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3 , we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G , significantly higher than wildtype CVB3 . In total , our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity . controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 \u00b5M DFMO - treated Veros . At 24 h , we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone ( no protease ) . We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO - sensitive ( Figure 5A , B ) . Interestingly , we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity , even in DFMO - treated cells . We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 326, "end": 332}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 480}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 970}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1197, "end": 1208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1255, "end": 1275}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1472}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1489, "end": 1498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1562, "end": 1569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1586, "end": 1595}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1650, "end": 1653}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
