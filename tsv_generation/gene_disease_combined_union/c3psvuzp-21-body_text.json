As such , numerous viruses manipulate host PTM machinery to regulate their own replication or evade host antiviral immunity . Research aimed at understanding these viral strategies has provided critical insight into the host processes mediated by PTMs , including tyrosine phosphorylation and regulation of histone acetylation [ 1 , 2 ] . Inspired by the fact that signatures of positive selection can be used to highlight important genes and PTMs in host - virus conflicts , we performed an evolutionary screen on all of the primate PARP genes to ask if ADP - ribosylation is an important player in host - virus dynamics . Contrary to what would be expected of a PTM that is solely dedicated to housekeeping functions , we found strong evidence for rapid evolution in five of seventeen primate PARP genes , suggesting a broad involvement for PARPs , and ADP - ribosylation , in genetic conflicts . Moreover , we observed evolutionary signatures that suggested an ancient history of conflict for these PARP genes . For example , we see positive selection on PARP4 in diverse mammalian clades and recurrent gain and loss of PARP14 and PARP15 across vertebrates . Our findings suggest that PARP4 , 9 , 13 , 14 and 15 are each locked in a genetic conflict , likely with one or more pathogenic agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 187}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 808}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1142, "end": 1153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1204}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1270}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1274, "end": 1281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1328, "end": 1355}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
