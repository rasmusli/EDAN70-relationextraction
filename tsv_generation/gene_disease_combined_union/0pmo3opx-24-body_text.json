Briefly , pAPN at 10 mg / mL concentration in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7 . 2 and 200 mM NaCl was crystallized by itself and then amino acid was soaked into the pAPN crystal . Crystallization of pAPN was set up with 1 \u00b5L protein solution and 1 \u00b5L well solution containing 18 % PEG3350 , 200 mM Li 2 SO4 , and 100 mM HEPES pH7 . 2 mixed together in sitting drops . Crystals of pAPN were grown at 4 \u00b0 C for two weeks , and were then transferred to amino acid - soaking solution containing 5 mM amino acid , 20 % ethylene glycol , 25 % PEG3350 , 200 mM Li 2 SO4 , and 100 mM HEPES pH7 . 2 for another two days . The crystals were flash frozen in liquid N2 and used for data collection . Data were collected at APS beamline 24 - ID and ALS beamline 4 . 2 . 2 . X - ray diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 36 . The structures of pAPN complexed different amino acids were determined by directly refining the model of the unliganded pAPN structure ( PDB 4FKE ) against the amino acid - soaked crystal data . Programs CNS 37 and CCP4 refmac 38 were used for structure refinement . Program COOT was used for model building and structural superposition 39 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 84}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 913}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1025}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
