Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 and infected with WNV at 24 h post - transfection . Total cell lysates were collected at 24 hours post - infection and Western blot was performed using anti - CxSTAT antibody . As a control , cells were either transfected with GFP dsRNA ( Control ) . The results ( Fig 5C ) showed cells infected with WNV showed decreased CxSTAT levels , which returned to baseline in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . Although , we cannot rule out the possibility that reduced degradation of CxSTAT upon CxCul4 knockdown is due to lower virus replication , these results combined with other data indicate that WNV infection leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 99}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 329}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 381, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 566}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 649}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 661}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 805}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 816}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 176}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 459}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 764}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T8", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
