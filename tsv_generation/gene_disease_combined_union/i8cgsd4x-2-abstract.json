It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response . Here , we have used an RNA - Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following West Nile virus ( WNV ) infection , identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated . Ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway genes , comprising 12 % of total differentially regulated genes , were selected for further validation by real time RT - qPCR and functional analysis . It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor , MG - 132 , decreased WNV titers , indicating importance of this pathway during infection process . In infection models , the Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A / B ( cullin RING ubiquitin ligase ) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo , especially in midguts of mosquitoes . Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that Culex Cul4 acts as a pro - viral protein by degradation of CxSTAT via ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway . We also show that gene knockdown of Culex Cul4 leads to activation of the Jak - STAT pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva . Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by WNV to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 930}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 953}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1210, "end": 1217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1291, "end": 1302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1333, "end": 1340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 119}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 404}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 410}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 815}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1481, "end": 1485}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
