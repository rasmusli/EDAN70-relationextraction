The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different fiveyear plan periods . ( 3 ) The affluence effect ( g - effect ) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase , while the energy intensity effect of production ( e - effect - Production ) , the economic structure effect ( s - effect ) and the carbon intensity effect of production ( f - effect - Production ) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector . ( 4 ) The affluence effect of urban ( g - effect - AUI ) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment , while the energy intensity effect of urban ( e - effect - Urban ) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector . , et al .
