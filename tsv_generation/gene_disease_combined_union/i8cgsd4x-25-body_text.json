{"cord_uid": "i8cgsd4x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4556628", "divid": "25", "text": "Recently , Culex Vago , which is induced in mosquitoes in response to WNV infection , was found to be functionally similar to mammalian interferon in that it is activated via the TRAF - NF - \u03baB pathway and , upon secretion , activates the Jak - STAT pathway and an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [ 7 , 35 ] . Our results here suggest that Culex STAT is regulated by Culex Cul4 ( mammalian Cul4A / B ortholog ) , which has proviral activity during WNV infection , and that WNV may target STAT for degradation by inducing Culex Cul4 via NS1 and NS5 proteins . Suppression of the mammalian interferon - mediated Jak - STAT pathway has been shown to be a common property of vector - borne flaviviruses . Dengue NS5 protein has been shown to target STAT2 for degradation [ 53 ] and WNV NS5 suppressed phosphorylation of STAT1 [ 54 ] , leading to decreased signaling in mammalian system . Interestingly , our results suggest that the mosquito Jak - STAT pathway is also targeted by WNV via cullin RING ubiquitin ligase . Although , we have identified WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins to be responsible for upregulation of Cul4 , the exact mechanism of this activation remains unknown . WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins have significantly different protein sequences , however both are involved in formation of viral replication complex . Studies are currently underway to determine whether this plays any part in the described mechanism . Our in vivo results also suggest that CxCul4 proviral activity may be mainly localized in the mosquito midgut and knockdown of CxCul4 increases Jak - STAT signaling in the midgut , thus decreasing the overall viral load in the body and , in turn , the saliva of these mosquitoes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 22}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 194}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 349, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 502}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 729}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 760}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 795}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 958}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 994, "end": 1023}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1055, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1067, "end": 1080}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1298, "end": 1324}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1472}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1554, "end": 1561}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1571, "end": 1582}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 461}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 27, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 27, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T11", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T8", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 7, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 8, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 9, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
