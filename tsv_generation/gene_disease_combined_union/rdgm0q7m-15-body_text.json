{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "15", "text": "Trans - activation of PRRSV \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF by nsp1 [UNK] was previously demonstrated by co - expression of nsp1 [UNK] and nsp2 in cultured cells and by site - directed mutagenesis of the viral genome ( 18 , 19 ) . To study the phenomenon in vitro , a 79 - bp fragment encompassing the slippery sequence and Crich region was subcloned between the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes of a frameshift - reporter plasmid ( pDluc ) such that expression of the downstream cistron ( fluc ) was dependent upon \u2212 2 PRF within the inserted PRRSV sequences . In RRL in vitro translations , mRNAs transcribed from pDluc / PRRSV specified the synthesis of only the product of the 5 cistron of the reporter mRNA ( Rluc ) and no frameshifting was evident ( Figure 1C ) . However , supplementation with recombinant , purified His - tagged nsp1 [UNK] yielded two additional proteins , the most abundant corresponding to the product of \u2212 2 PRF . The second protein migrated more rapidly than that of Rluc and we surmised that this protein corresponded to the product of a \u2212 1 PRF , as a \u2212 1 frame stop codon is present immediately downstream of the slippery sequence ( underlined in Figure 1A ) . To confirm this , the \u2212 1 frame stop codon ( UGA ) was changed to UUA , which extends the \u2212 1 reading frame by 56 codons and simultaneously introduces a 0 - frame stop codon UAA thus shortening the Rluc gene . As expected , this point mutation increased the size of the predicted \u2212 1 PRF product , and slightly reduced the size of the Rluc protein ( stop ) . These experiments indicate that the 79 - nt region cloned into pDluc likely contains all of the cis - acting elements required for PRRSV \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 frameshifting and that supplementation of the RRL translations with nsp1 [UNK] alone is sufficient to transactivate frameshifting to levels similar to those seen in infected cells ( \u2212 2 PRF , 17 % ; \u2212 1 PRF , 7 % ; see Supplementary Table ) . The stimulation of PRF by nsp1 [UNK] was specific to the PRRSV signal in that the protein had no effect on frameshifting at a variety of well - established sites of viral \u2212 1 PRF ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Furthermore , the protein was unable to promote stop codon readthrough at variants of the PRRSV signal with an in - frame stop codon placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would be decoded in the peptidyl - ( P ) or aminoacyl - ( A ) site of the ribosome ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 126}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 319}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 382}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 417}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 474}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 585}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 677}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 698}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 705}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 987}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1062}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1149}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1201, "end": 1222}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1332, "end": 1353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1377, "end": 1387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1459, "end": 1475}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1574, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1601, "end": 1607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1634, "end": 1656}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1731, "end": 1735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1753, "end": 1764}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1871, "end": 1875}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T38", "span": {"begin": 1888, "end": 1892}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T39", "span": {"begin": 1947, "end": 1951}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T40", "span": {"begin": 1954, "end": 1965}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
