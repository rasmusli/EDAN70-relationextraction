However , comparatively few wildlife epidemiological studies use quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) for pathogen detection , even fewer employ an internal control , to ensure confidence in negative results , and PCR ' s ability to multiplex and therefore detect several targets in a single reaction is underutilised . Here , we describe the development of two multiplex qPCR assays for the red and grey squirrel that detect the pathogens squirrelpox virus ( SQPV ) and adenovirus in squirrels ( SADV ) , both of which cause mortality in the red squirrel . Both assays use a section of the squirrel phosphoglycerate kinase gene as an endogenous internal control that identifies and compensates for both , inadequate sampling or PCR inhibition . Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples ( particularly from distal antebrachial skin ) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of SQPV DNA in both squirrel species , while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate SADV infection . These assays are sensitive and specific with an endogenous internal control providing confidence in negative results and allowing comparison across laboratories . Using such assays should prove advantageous in wildlife studies with limited resources while allowing the maximum data yield .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 754}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1052, "end": 1061}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 583}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 607}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1163, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 5, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
