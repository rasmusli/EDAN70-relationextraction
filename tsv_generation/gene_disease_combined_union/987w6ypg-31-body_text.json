Despite the fact that the overall restrictive phenotype would nonetheless remain , the underlaying mechanism would be profoundly different , as in this case the incorporation of IFITMs would be probably a mark , but not a cause of the infectivity defect described here . We believe the future identification of IFITM mutants that have lost the ability to be incorporated into viral particles may help us distinguish between these possibilities and efforts toward this goal are ongoing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
