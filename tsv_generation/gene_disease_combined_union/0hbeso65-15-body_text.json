Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids , while tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic . Both drugs bind with high affinity to a family of cytoplasmic proteins ( also called immunophilin ) , which present in a variety of immune cells . Immunophilindependent signal transduction via calcineurin represents a key event in the activation of T cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes IL2 . Cyclosporine A ( CyA ) binds to cyclophilin , while tacrolimus ( Tac ) binds to FK binding proteins ( FKBPs ) . The binding blocks the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and subsequently inhibits TCR / CD3 - induced T cell proliferation by the blockage of IL2 production . Intriguingly , in addition to their promoting role in calcineurin signalling , immunophilins are catalysts of protein folding and contribute to the invasion ability of several coronaviruses [ 41 ] . As to HCV , it is well established that cyclophilins have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production . Recent data suggest that HCV replication is dependent on the interaction between cyclophilin B and nonstructural protein 5B ( NS5B , HCV RNA polymerase ) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo synthesis of positive and negative stranded RNA [ 42 ] . Given the fact that immunophilins can work as a supportive role in viral infection , it is rational to find out that CyA is capable of the anti - HCV activity through mediating a specific blockade of cyclophilins to NS5B RNA [ 43 ] . As CyA interacts with both cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B , it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV . However , there is controversy about the anti - HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo . By contrast , Tac does not have any anti - HCV activity [ 44 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 577}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 616}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 628, "end": 640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 836}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1169, "end": 1194}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1201}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1203, "end": 1222}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1307, "end": 1342}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1371, "end": 1385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1551, "end": 1564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1612, "end": 1626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1630, "end": 1644}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1825, "end": 1829}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 948, "end": 952}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 1095, "end": 1099}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 1418, "end": 1424}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T20", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T19", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T18", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T17", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T16", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
