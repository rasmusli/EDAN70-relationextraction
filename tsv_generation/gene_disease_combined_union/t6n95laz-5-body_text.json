The ultimate aim was to identify the differences in serum protein levels that were closely associated with the progression of hepatitis B and HBV - induced ACLF . The results of this study may provide crucial information regarding viral mechanisms and the pathogenic process .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 74}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 292}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 146}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 156}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 364}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 372}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 387}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
