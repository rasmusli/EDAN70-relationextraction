This provides the virus with a platform for the assembly of viral replication complexes , improving efficiency of RNA synthesis . The membranes observed in coronavirus infected cells include double membrane vesicles . By nature of their double membrane , these vesicles resemble cellular autophagosomes , generated during the cellular autophagy pathway . In addition , coronavirus infection has been demonstrated to induce autophagy . Here we review current knowledge of coronavirus induced membrane rearrangements and the involvement of autophagy or autophagy protein microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 ( LC3 ) in coronavirus replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 719, "end": 767}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 773}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 318}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
