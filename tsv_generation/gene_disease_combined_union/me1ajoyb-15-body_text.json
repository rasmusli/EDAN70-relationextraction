In experimental infections of rats with SEOV and deer mice with SNV , early infection results in subtle inflammatory signatures , but a regulatory T cell ( Treg ) response predominates at persistence ( Figure 1 ) [ 20 , 54 ] . Treg responses are critical for suppressing inflammation [ 71 , 72 ] ; however , inflammation is a prominent feature of hantavirus disease in humans [ 73 ] and hamsters [ 55 , 74 ] . In other viral diseases , the occurrence of a Treg response is associated with persistent infection because these cells , while suppressing inflammation , also prevent virus clearance [ 75 , 76 ] . For reservoirs of hantaviruses , the Treg response may limit inflammatory immunopathology to an otherwise innocuous infection , but it may also impair virus clearance . How this relationship evolved is unknown , but considering the presence of hantavirus proteins with immunomodulatory activities , it suggests the viruses may manipulate the host response to favor persistence ; a Treg response may prevent sterilizing immunity , thus allow virus to remain in a population . It may also explain the ecoimmunology and ecology of hantavirus infections of reservoir hosts , thus studies assessing the energetics of inflammatory and anti - inflammatory immune responses should be performed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 715, "end": 720}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 909}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1111, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1248, "end": 1253}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 62}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 327}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 625}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 693}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 885, "end": 898}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1395, "end": 1406}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
