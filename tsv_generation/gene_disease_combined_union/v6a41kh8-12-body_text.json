Trained fieldworkers referred children with respiratory complaints to the study clinic at the outpatient department ( OPD ) at Siddhi Memorial Hospital in Bhaktapur , and families could bring their children for free treatment at our clinic for common childhood illnesses . Children residing in Bhaktapur district , but outside the municipality , were only under such passive surveillance . Children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing ( LCI ) and classified according to the standard World Health Organization ( WHO ) algorithm for acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) [ 19 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with fast breathing , that is \u2265 50 breaths / min for children 2 to 11 months old , and \u2265 40 breaths / min for children \u2265 12 months old . Severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with LCI . Children with audible or auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2 . 5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart followed by reassessment after 30 min , which is in accordance with the revised WHO guidelines [ 20 ] . A child was included only if he or she had fast breathing or LCI at reassessment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 157}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 226}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 678}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 797}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 803}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 827, "end": 837}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1027, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1059, "end": 1065}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1102, "end": 1106}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1133}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1396, "end": 1400}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
