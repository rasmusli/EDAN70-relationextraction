The ability of MERS - CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis . Many MERS - CoV - encoded proteins were identified to have interferon ( IFN ) - antagonizing properties , which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models . In this study , we fully characterized the IFN - antagonizing property of the MERS - CoV M protein . Expression of MERS - CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly ( I : C ) induction . This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) but not nuclear factor - \u03baB . MERS - CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3 - TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation . M proteins from MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV have three highly similar conserved N - terminal transmembrane domains and a C - terminal region . Using chimeric and truncation mutants , the N - terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS - CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression , whereas the C - terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression . Collectively , our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1 - dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 326}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 361}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 440}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 545}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 597}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 656}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 830}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 832, "end": 837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 890}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 912}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 932, "end": 939}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 970, "end": 975}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1101}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1215, "end": 1236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1293, "end": 1297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1322, "end": 1342}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1523, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1551, "end": 1557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1584, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 70}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 682, "end": 705}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 27, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
