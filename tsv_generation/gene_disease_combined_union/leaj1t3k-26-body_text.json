All PNAs were conjugated to tat via an O - linker to promote efficient cellular uptake . Tat - PNAs successfully inhibited JEV proliferation in cell culture . JEV replication is thought to take place in specialized structures derived from host membranes harboring the viral RNA polymerase and host proteins involved in viral RNA replication [ 97 ] . This would mean that not only tat - PNA conjugates crossed the plasma membrane but they were also able to penetrate into the convoluted membrane system to interfere with viral replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 199}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 497}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 588, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 78}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
