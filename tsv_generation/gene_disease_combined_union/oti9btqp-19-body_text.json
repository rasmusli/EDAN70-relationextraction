One set of control and vaccinated mice received 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU of ZIKV - PR209 by the s . c . route and the other set of each group were challenged with a total of 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU ZIKV - PR209 by the s . c . route . At 3 weeks post challenge , 100 % of all ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals survived , whereas only 30 % of the single - or 10 % of double - dose challenged controls survived ( Figures 5a , b ) . In all the challenges , the vaccinated animals were without signs of disease including no . Induction of ZIKV specific cellular immune responses following ZIKV - prME vaccination of non - human primates ( NHPs ) . ( a ) ELISpot analysis measuring IFN - \u03b3 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to ZIKV - prME immunisation . Rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally with 2 mg of ZIKV - prME plasmid at weeks 0 and 4 administered as 1 mg at each of two sites , with immunisation immediately followed by intradermal electroporation . PBMCs were isolated pre - immunisation and at week 6 and were used for the ELISPOT assay to detect IFN - \u03b3 - secreting cells in response to stimulation with ZIKV - prME peptides as described in the ' Materials and Methods ' section . The number of IFN - \u03b3 producing cells obtained per million PBMCs against six peptide pools encompassing the entire prME protein is shown . The values represent mean responses in each group ( n = 5 ) \u00b1 s . e . m . ( b ) Detection of ZIKV - prME - specific antibody responses following DNA vaccination . Anti - ZIKV IgG antibodies were measured pre - immunisation and at week 6 by ELISA . ( c ) Endpoint ELISA titres for anti ZIKV - Env antibodies are shown following the first and second immunisations . ( d ) Western blot analysis using week 6 RM immune sera demonstrated binding to recombinant Env protein . ( e ) PRNT activity of serum from RM immunised with ZIKV - prME . Pre - immunisation and week 6 immune sera from individual monkeys were tested by plaque - reduction neutralisation ( PRNT ) assay for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro . PRNT 50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50 % of the input virus . Calculated ( PRNT 50 ) values are listed for each monkey .
