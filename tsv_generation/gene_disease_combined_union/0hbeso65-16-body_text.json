Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) belongs to the class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive agents . Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , the active metabolite of MMF , is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . In addition to its potent immunosuppressive capacity , the in vitro assay has indicated that MPA has antiviral effect against HCV [ 45 ] . In HCV cell culture models , MPA could induce the expression of important antiviral interferon - stimulated genes , including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) 1 , IRF 9 , and interferoninduced transmembrane protein 3 ( IFITM3 ) [ 46 ] . Among these proteins , data showed that IRF1 was directly involved in the anti - HCV activity of MPA . Moreover , MPA could have effects in synergy with IFN - on HCV replication in the same HCV experiments . In addition , when combined with IFN - , MPA augmented the transcription of multiple interferon - stimulated genes . With the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with IFN , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against HCV in vivo . On the other hand , although the safety and efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressive medication in HCV patients undergoing LT have been demonstrated , the exact effects on HCV recurrence have not been clearly studied .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 248}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 564}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 793, "end": 797}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 881, "end": 885}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 963}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 406}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 834}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1124, "end": 1128}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1263}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1309, "end": 1313}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
