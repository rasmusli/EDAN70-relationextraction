Such excessive inflammation is detrimental in vertebrates of other species , such as humans , and is linked to pathology [ 28 ] . So , it is beneficial for the bats to have evolved mechanisms that would allow them to control excessive inflammation . Cell culture experiments have shown that cells of several species of bats have an inhibitor molecule ( cRel ) binding site in the promoter region of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF\u03b1 ) , a key inflammatory cytokine . In cells of big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus ) , stimulated with poly I : C , a surrogate for double - stranded viral RNA , cRel actively suppresses TNF\u03b1 expression [ 29 ] . Genome analysis of black flying foxes and David ' s myotis have also demonstrated positive selection pressure on the cRel gene [ 21 ] . This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNF\u03b1 , thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 467, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 531}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 562}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 564, "end": 569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 669, "end": 680}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 726}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 728, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 905}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 57}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 383}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 540}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 837}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1040, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T11", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
