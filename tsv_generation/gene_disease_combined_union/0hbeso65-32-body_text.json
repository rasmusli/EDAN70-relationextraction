Imidazole - based compounds mimicking an alpha helix in the LEL of CD81 compete for HCV E2 - CD81 binding [ 111 ] . These drugs bind E2 in a reversible manner and block E2 - CD81 interaction while having no effect neither on CD81 expression nor on CD81 interaction with physiological partner molecules . In addition , recent study demonstrated that anti - CD81 antibodies completely protected human liver - uPA - SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes [ 112 ] . However , administration of anti - CD81 antibodies after viral challenge had no effect . Anti - SR - BI antibodies , which block the interaction of SR - BI with HCV , are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry . Anti - SR - BI antibodies have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro [ 113 ] . Moreover , small molecule inhibitors of SR - BI have recently been developed . For example , ITX5061 is a compound that inhibits entry of HCVpp from all major genotypes and HCVcc infection without affecting viral replication [ 114 ] . In addition , recent study demonstrated that a human monoclonal antibody targeting SR - BI efficiently precluded HCV infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [ 115 ] . Kinetic studies suggest that this small molecule inhibitor targets HCV entry during an early postbinding stage . CLDN1 has been suggested to play an important role in cell - cell transmission . Recently , anti - CLDN1 antibodies inhibiting HCV infection in vitro have been developed [ 116 ] . The results have shown that anti - CLDN1 antibodies efficiently block cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that are resistant to host neutralizing antibodies . As mentioned above , EGFR and EphA2 are two newly established host factors for HCV entry . Thus , their respective inhibitors , erlotinib and dasatinib , are also regarded as promising HCV inhibitors in preventing HCV reinfection after LT [ 103 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 294}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 667}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 708}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 775, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 918}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1152, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1188, "end": 1196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1402, "end": 1408}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1494, "end": 1518}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1610, "end": 1634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1729, "end": 1758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1781, "end": 1786}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1790, "end": 1796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1822, "end": 1835}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 1218, "end": 1222}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 1529, "end": 1533}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 1974, "end": 1978}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T15", "obj": 24, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
