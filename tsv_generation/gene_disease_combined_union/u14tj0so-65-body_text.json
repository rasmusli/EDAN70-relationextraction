We compare this method with two of the best - performing methods [ 44 ] for prediction of pseudoknotted structures , namely HotKnots V2 . 0 [ 36 ] , a MFE - based heuristic method , and IPknot [ 42 ] , a method that is based on maximum expected accuracy . ( Prepared by Puton et al . [ 44 ] , CompaRNA , is the website for continuous comparison of RNA secondary structure methods on both PDB data set and RNA strand . We chose IPknot because it was the best - performing noncomparative pseudoknot prediction method that can handle long RNA sequences , based on the ranking on their website as of March 25 , 2014 . We also noticed that Puton et al . used HotKnots V1 for their comparison , and not the more recently available and better performing Hot - Knots V2 . 0 . Therefore we chose to include HotKnots in our comparisons as well . Since the focus of this paper is on prediction of pseudoknotted structures , we do not compare our results with that of Co - Fold [ 26 ] or other methods for prediction of pseudoknot free structures . ) Table 3 presents the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure for Iterative HFold with hotspots as input , HotKnots V2 . 0 , Sim - Fold and IPknot with default setting ( see Section ' Accuracy comparison tests ' ) on the HK - PK and HK - PKfree data sets . For pseudoknotted structures , our permutation tests show that the difference in accuracy of Iterative HFold and HotKnots is not significant . However , the superior accuracy of Iterative HFold compared with SimFold and IPknot is significant . For pseudoknotfree structures , the difference in accuracy between IPknot , Iterative HFold , HotKnots and SimFold is not significant .
