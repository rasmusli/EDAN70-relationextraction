ARDS patients suffer from severe hypoxemia , and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) therapy may be necessary to ensure oxygenation . ARDS has various etiologies , including trauma , ischemia - reperfusion injury or infections of various origins , and the associated immunological responses may vary . To support the immunological response in this patient collective , we used intravenous IgM immunoglobulin therapy to enhance the likelihood of pulmonary recovery . Methods : ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) who were placed on ECMO and treated with ( IVIG group ; n = 29 ) or without ( control group ; n = 28 ) intravenous IgM - enriched immunoglobulins for 3 days in the initial stages of ARDS were analyzed retrospectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 56}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 322}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 590}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 830}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
