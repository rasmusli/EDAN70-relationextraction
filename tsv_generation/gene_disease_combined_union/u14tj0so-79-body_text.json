On the HK - PK and HK - PK - free data sets , accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these . An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs , as calculated using the partition function [ 43 ] . Even better may be to calculate base pair probabilities for base pairs of pseudoknotted RNA structures ; however this requires ( n 5 ) time . Since HFold finds minimum free energy structure in O ( n 3 ) time , conditional on the given input structure , we are currently investigating ways to develop an O ( n 3 ) - time partition function version of HFold that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 580}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 612}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 663}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 865}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
