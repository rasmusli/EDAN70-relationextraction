Identification of cell surface markers could shed light on what cells respond during hantavirus infection of reservoir hosts . While cell surface antigens tend to be more divergent , intracellular proteins , such as antiviral proteins , tend to be more conserved , particularly phosphoepitopes . Thus , it is likely that many available antibodies to house mouse ( Mus musculus ) or Norway rat antiviral proteins will be cross - reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species . Without information as to which proteins may be of interest , screening of antibodies is a daunting and expensive task since most likely will not be informative . However , combined with RNA - Seq and metabolomic data , it is likely that target proteins and pathways can be identified so that investigators can focus their efforts and resources . In addition , software tools can help predict whether antibodies may be cross - reactive to proteins from reservoir hosts [ 109 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 33}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 467}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 201}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
