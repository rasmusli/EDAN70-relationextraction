The experiment was conducted in duplicate and since Pearson correlation coefficients of 0 . 994 ( control ) and 0 . 991 ( WNV ) indicated close agreement between the biological replicates ( S1 Table ) , data from the replicates was combined for further analysis . The raw sequencing and downstream files were deposited at NCBI with accession code GSE60229 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 70}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
