Heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) are a group of proteins that respond to stress , including heat , hypoxia , irradiation , infection , or toxic agents 46 . HSP has been shown to influence apoptosis in tumour cells , regulate p53 function , and induce an immune response to tumours 47 . Increased HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis , but they also can increase immunity to cancer 48 . For example , over - expressed HSP60 protein is suggested to promote prostate cancer , colorectal cancer , and primary breast cancer ; for these cancers , HSP60 inhibitors may be used as anti - cancer agents [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] . Whereas , a loss of HSP60 immunopositivity is related to the development and progression of bronchial cancer in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 52 . In this experiment , we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and the HSP90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and 60 hpi . As the influence of the HSP expression changes due to different cancers , the anti - cancer significance of the differential expression of HSPs in CPV - infected cells is complicated and requires further study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 24}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 87}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 507}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 916}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 972}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1050, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 271}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 344}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 457}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 567}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 573, "end": 595}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 615}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 802}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 856}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 7, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 20, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 8, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 19, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
