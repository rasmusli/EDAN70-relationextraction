Each reaction plate contained ( 1 ) a positive control for the target genes , ( 2 ) a standardised calibrator sample ( 1 \u00d7 10 7 copies of reference and target genes made up to 200 ng total DNA using \u03bb DNA ) and ( 3 ) a triplicate of a standard of known quantities of all assay genes . See Online Resource S4 for the layout of a typical sample plate . One standard curve ( imported during software analysis ) was used for analysis of several qPCR plates , rather than making a standard curve for each plate ( allowing more samples per plate ) ; this allowed the standard within the plate to act as a reference on the standard curve while the calibrator acted as a reference for inter - plate variation ( see normalisation calculation below ) . The mean C p value was converted to a copy number and a normalised relative quantitative ratio ( RQ ) of the target gene to reference gene was then calculated using the following equation :", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 968, "end": 980}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 998}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
