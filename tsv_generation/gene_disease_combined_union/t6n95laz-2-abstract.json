{"cord_uid": "t6n95laz", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3820766", "divid": "2", "text": "The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in serum protein levels in the progression of hepatitis B using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) analysis , in addition to comparing the serum protein levels of patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) , patients with hepatitis B virus - induced acute - on - chronic liver failure ( HBV - induced ACLF ) and normal individuals . Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ . The study population included healthy controls ( n = 5 ) , patients with CHB ( n = 5 ) and patients with HBV - induced ACLF ( n = 5 ) . Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls , patients with CHB and patients with HBV - induced ACLF ( n = 3 , respectively ) . Using iTRAQ analysis , 16 different serum proteins with \u2265 1 . 5 - fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls . Five of those proteins , C - reactive protein precursor , hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin , which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases , were subsequently verified using western blotting . The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ . Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process , and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV - induced ACLF remain unclear . This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist . The analysis of a larger number of samples is required to identify potential protein biomarkers that may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatitis B .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 812}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 851}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1047}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1076, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1119, "end": 1147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1163}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1671, "end": 1686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 274}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 280}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 316}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 326, "end": 361}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 367}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 547, "end": 551}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 583}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 598}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 736}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 758}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 773}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 945}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 954}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 1278, "end": 1293}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 1560, "end": 1565}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 1911, "end": 1923}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T8", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
