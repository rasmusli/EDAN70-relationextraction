The importance of respiratory infectious agents , both viruses ( e . g . , respiratory syncytial virus , rhinovirus , metapneumovirus , parainfluenza virus , and coronavirus ) and bacteria ( e . g . , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) , in the development of asthma exacerbations has been stressed by several authors [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . The role of infections in acute wheezing is even more evident in the first years of life . Indeed , our results highlight that almost all the wheezing preschool - aged children had an underlying respiratory illness . On the other hand , one - third of the children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger , whereas in 10 % the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit . In fact , several agents can elicit acute asthma : respiratory tract infections , environmental allergens , pollutants , and stress [ 14 , 15 ] . Moreover , synergistic interactions between these factors might also very likely play a role [ 14 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 87}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 319}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 442}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 564}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 674}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 738}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 817}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 985}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
