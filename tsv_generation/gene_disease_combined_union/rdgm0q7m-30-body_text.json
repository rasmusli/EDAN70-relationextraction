Here , lowfrequency stop codon readthrough at the end of the proangiogenic VEGFA coding sequence appends an additional 22 amino acids to the C - terminus , generating the VEGF - Ax isoform which possesses anti - angiogenic activity . The readthrough event is promoted by the binding of hnRNP A2 / B1 to a recognition element 10 nt downstream of the recoded VEGFA stop codon . Similar to PCBPs , hnRNP A2 / B1 is known to associate with nascent cellular RNAs and influence their localization , maturation and function ( 56 ) . How it acts to stimulate readthrough is unknown , but it is striking that both hnRNP A2 / B1 and the nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP complex promote their respective recoding events from a similar distance 3 of the ribosome , suggesting that they may contact the ribosome directly . How they subvert translation likely differs in each case as we were unable to uncover any stop codon readthrough activity of the nsp1 [UNK] / PCBP2 complex ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 61}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 205}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 355, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 403}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 556}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 819, "end": 833}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 841, "end": 867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 950}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1099, "end": 1110}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1138, "end": 1165}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
