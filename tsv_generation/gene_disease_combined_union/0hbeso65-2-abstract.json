{"cord_uid": "0hbeso65", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3655463", "divid": "2", "text": "Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is a small - enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family . Since first identified in 1989 , HCV has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide . Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history , from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma . The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin . On the other hand , HCV - related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation . However , posttransplant HCV re - infection of the graft has been reported to be universal . Furthermore , the graft after HCV re - infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure . In addition , treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon - based therapies . Taken together , poor outcome after HCV re - infection , regardless of grafts or recipients , poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons . The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re - infection after transplant : risk factors , current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation , cellular function of HCV proteins , and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry . Hopefully , this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1308, "end": 1321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 135}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 228}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 281}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 328}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 368}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 482}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 668}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 727, "end": 741}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 794}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 966}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1240}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1453, "end": 1467}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
