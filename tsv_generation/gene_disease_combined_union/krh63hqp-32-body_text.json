We suggest that , while specific adaptive mutations commonly occur within the H1N1 virus , many more deleterious mutations are accumulating than beneficial mutations , even when there is strong selection . Consequently , H1N1 appears to have been in very gradual error catastrophe throughout its history .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
