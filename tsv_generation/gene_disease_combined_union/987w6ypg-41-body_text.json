After Formalin fixation , cells were incubated with the following antibodies : anti - Flag ( F7425 , Sigma ) , followed by DyLight 649 - conjugated sheep , or FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( STAR36D649 AbD serotec and FI - 1000 Vector ) . DAPI - containing mounting medium was finally used ( DAPI Fluormount G , Southern biotech ) . Images were acquired using a spectral Leica sp5 and analyzed with the Fiji software [ 54 ] . Two - dimensional graphs representing pixel intensities ( gray level ) were plotted along a 30\u03bcm lines ( yellow on Figure 3B ) , using Plot Profile tool in Image - J . The extent of reciprocal co - localization between Gag and IFITMs was quantified using the Manders overlap coefficient ( Fuji image software ) on more than 40 cells per condition .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 125}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 141}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 161}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 212}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 473}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 565}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 979}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 990}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
