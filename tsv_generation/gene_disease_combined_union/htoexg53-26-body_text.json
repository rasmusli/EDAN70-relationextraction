These mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the MERS - CoV S protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies [ 23 , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] 54 ] . Moreover , BALB / c mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( hDPP4 ) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive MERS - CoV lung infection , which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS - CoV - specific immunization using the MERS - CoV S protein [ 24 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 ] . Here , we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an MVA - delivered MERS - CoV N antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice . In general , the N protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral RNA within the viral nucleocapsid [ 55 ] . In previous studies , the SARS - CoV N protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development [ 56 ] , and an experimental DNA vaccine efficiently induced SARS - CoV N - specific cellular immunity [ 57 , 58 ] . In line with this data , recent studies in MERS patients demonstrated that both antibody and T cell responses are associated with recovery from MERS - CoV infection [ 59 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 584}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 592}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 804}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 932}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1017}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1037, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 677}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1427, "end": 1432}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1528, "end": 1549}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
