This may explain the clinical variability and lack of a definitive agent , however , the low recurrence rate even in high prevalence areas speaks against a large number of causes [ 40 ] . A superantigen response was considered by numerous groups [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] . Certain bacterial infections contain proteins that non - specifically bind effector cell receptors causing a more generalized polyclonal expansion and inflammation , termed a superantigen effect . Polyclonality of T cell receptor usage has been shown in KD [ 47 , 48 ] ; however , the reports are variable as to which subset of T cell receptors are expanded [ 49 ] . Other studies support a traditional oligoclonal response consistent with an immune response against a specific etiologic agent . Oligoclonal expansion of CD8 + T cells [ 50 ] and peripheral IgM + B cell responses have been demonstrated [ 5 , 51 ] , and IGG + clonality is seen in studies from our own laboratory ( unpublished ) . Numerous other studies have not shown superantigen - associated expansions of cell subsets [ 50 , 52 , 53 ] . This concept is reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 45 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 502}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 633}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 731, "end": 748}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 432}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 660}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
