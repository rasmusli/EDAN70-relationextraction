We found that , following poly ( I : C ) injection , serum ALT levels in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice increased , reached a peak one day after injection , declined from day 1 to day 6 , and were not elevated thereafter ; this time - course indicated that poly ( I : C ) injection alone did not induced continuous liver injury ( figure S6 ) . Based on these findings , we believe that the effects of poly ( I : C ) injection in these mice did not confound our analysis of chronic hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 35}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 62}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 521, "end": 534}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 3, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 5, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
