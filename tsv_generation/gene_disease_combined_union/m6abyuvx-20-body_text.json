Furthermore , to investigate whether TNF - a and IL - 6 played particularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis in the transgenic mice , we neutralized TNF - a and blocked the IL - 6 receptor in the livers of these mice . As expected , chronic hepatitis did not develop in these mice .
