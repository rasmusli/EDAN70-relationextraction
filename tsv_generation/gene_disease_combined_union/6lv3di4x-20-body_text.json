This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection , which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area . In fact , MDM were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by IL - 4 polarization . This is relevant , as such a polarization could also be induced following JEV infection of NEC through the release of alarmins , such as IL - 33 , IL - 25 , and TSLP , from stressed and dying epithelial cells ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 ) . These alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL - 4 and IL - 13 , which promote M2 - like macrophage polarization ( 62 ) ( 63 ) ( 64 ) ( 65 ) . In fact , our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages . We also demonstrated that these alarmins can enhance JEV infection of macrophages , further supporting this concept .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 245}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 641}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 783}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 793, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 811}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 822}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 910}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1004}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1265, "end": 1274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 121}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 138}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 161}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 514}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 744}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1290}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
