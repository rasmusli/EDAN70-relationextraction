IL28B polymorphism has also been associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [ 25 ] . One cohort study , Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive HCV patients undergoing LT , aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient IL28B genotypes among liver transplant recipients [ 26 ] . The authors suggested that recipient IL28B TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of HCV after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with HCV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 61}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 99}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 158}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 208}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 356}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 469}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 605, "end": 622}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 759}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 841, "end": 855}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 12, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 7, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 8, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
