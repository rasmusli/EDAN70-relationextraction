Each test solution ( 50 \u00b5l ) was pipetted onto the sample pad and driven to migrate by capillary action along the strip . If HCV antibodies were present in the serum or plasma , they would react with the colloidal goldconjugated antigen to form an antibody - antigen complex . This complex would flow through the absorbent device and bind to the antigen in the positive reaction test zone ( ' T ' area ) , forming a gold - conjugated Ag - Ab - Ag sandwich complex , producing a pink - purple colored band . A colored band in the control region of the device indicates adequate sample volume and capillary action . The absence of a colored band in the control region is an indication of an invalid result . Positive results were read as soon as two colored bands appeared . Negative samples provided only one pink control band . If no control band was present , the test was considered invalid . Color formation for both reactions was complete after 5 - 10 min . A schematic representation of possible test results is shown in Fig . 2B .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 312}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 501}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 166}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
