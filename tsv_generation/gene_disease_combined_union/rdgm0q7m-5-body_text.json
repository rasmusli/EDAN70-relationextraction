{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "5", "text": "Recently , we identified a novel , highly efficient \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF event that functions without a recognizable stimulatory RNA secondary structure ( 18 , 19 ) . This signal operates during translation of the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) , a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales ( 20 ) . The PRRSV genome ( Figure 1 ) , a positive - sense RNA molecule some 15 kb in length , harbours two PRF signals . A ' canonical ' \u2212 1 PRF element , including a stimulatory RNA pseudo - The [UNK] 15 - kb PRRSV genome has two long 5 ORFs , 1a and 1b encoding non - structural polyproteins ( nsps ) and at least eight shorter 3 ORFs ( 2a - 7 ) encoding structural proteins . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA , with translation of ORF1b depending on \u2212 1 PRF at the end of ORF1a . The TF ORF overlaps the central ORF1a region in the \u2212 2 reading frame and is accessed via \u2212 2 PRF ( 18 ) . A \u2212 1 frameshift at the same site generates the nsp2N product . Shown below is the sequence of the SD01 - 08 RNA in the region of the \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF signal , with the slippery sequence ( purple ) and C - rich motif ( red ) highlighted . The \u2212 1 reading frame stop codon is underlined and codons for each of the reading frames are indicated . ( B ) Crystal structure of the PRRSV nsp1 [UNK] dimer ( 32 ) . The putative RNA binding domain is in orange ( see text ) . ( C ) RNAs derived from FspI - cut pDluc PRRSV / wt , or a variant with the \u2212 1 frame stop codon ( panel A ) changed to UUA ( PRRSV / stop ) , were translated in RRL in the presence of the indicated concentrations of His - tagged nsp1 [UNK] ( M ) or with nsp1 [UNK] dilution buffer ( DB ) . The products were resolved by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and visualized by autoradiography . 14 C molecular size markers were also run on the gel ( M ) . Products generated by ribosomes that do not frameshift ( stop ) or that enter the \u2212 1 or \u2212 2 frames are indicated . The asterisk indicates the \u2212 1 PRF product of the PRRSV / wt construct . ( D ) In vitro translation of pDluc PRRSV / wt mRNA in the presence of 1 M GST - nsp1 \u2424 or mutant derivatives ( PR , RBM ; see text ) . Control translations were supplemented with an equivalent concentration of expressed GST or DB alone . Translation products were analysed and quantified as above ( C ) . knot structure , is located at the junction of the overlapping replicase - encoding ORFs 1a and 1b and facilitates expression of an ORF1a - ORF1b fusion product . The second signal , which stimulates both \u2212 2 PRF and \u2212 1 PRF , is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large , multifunctional replicase subunit , non - structural protein 2 ( nsp2 ) . Here , about 20 % of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the \u2212 2 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein ( nsp2TF ) comprising the N - terminal two - thirds of nsp2 and a C - terminus derived from a conserved , overlap - ping ORF ( transframe ; TF ) in the \u2212 2 reading frame . A further 7 % of ribosomes shift into the \u2212 1 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N ( 19 ) . As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence ( GG GUU UUU ) used for \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA - structure - stimulated PRF . However , mutations within a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the shift site reduce or Nucleic Acids Research , 2016 , Vol . 44 , No . 12 5493 inhibit frameshifting , consistent with the presence of a 3 stimulatory element of some form ( 18 ) . A further novelty of the PRRSV \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25 - kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1 \u2424 , which functions as a trans - activator of both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF ( Figure 1B ) ( 19 ) . Nsp1 \u2424 is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins . How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA - binding motif located in the papain - like autoproteinase ( PLP ) domain of nsp1 \u2424 have a detrimental effect on frameshifting ( 19 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 369}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 456}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 639}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 682}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 691}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 722}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 740}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 776}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 804}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 821, "end": 825}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 839, "end": 845}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 858}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 892}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 899, "end": 917}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 952}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1138}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1194, "end": 1223}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1326, "end": 1349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1371, "end": 1390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1429}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1442, "end": 1449}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1459, "end": 1470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1494, "end": 1515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1544, "end": 1557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1653}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T38", "span": {"begin": 1673, "end": 1678}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 39, "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 269}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 40, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
