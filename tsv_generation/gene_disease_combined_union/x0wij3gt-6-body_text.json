An estimated 226 , 160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone , and 160 , 340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [ 1 ] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer . Protein levels of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , a mediator of inflammation , were reported elevated in several cancer types , including colorectal , prostate , and lung cancers , and suppression of either COX - 2 expression or COX - 2 activation , is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [ 2 ] . Of the five prostaglandins ( PG ) produced by COX - 2 , PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , and immunosuppression [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1 - 4 . These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [ 6 , 7 ] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 438}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 973}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 200}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 277}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 336}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 389}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 512}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 571}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 673}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1026}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1102, "end": 1140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1187}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 16, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 15, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 7, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
