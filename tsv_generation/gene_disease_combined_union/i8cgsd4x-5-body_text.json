The results show multiple cellular pathways are involved during infection . Using mosquito infection studies in vitro and in vivo , we determine that the ubiquitin - proteasomal system plays a major role during WNV infection in mosquitoes . We also show that Culex cullin ( orthologous to mammalian Cul4A / B ) is induced by WNV infection and blocks Jak - STAT signalling , increasing WNV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 460}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 497}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 176}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 403}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 517}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 573, "end": 577}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
