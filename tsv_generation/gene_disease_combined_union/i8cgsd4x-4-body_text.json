Infection of female mosquitoes with these viruses during blood feeding elicits an immune response . It is not known how the viruses manage to replicate in spite of this antiviral response . We used an unbiased transcriptome sequencing approach to identify genes differentially regulated after WNV infection resulting in 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways . Ubiquitin - proteasomal pathway , responsible for protein degradation , was found to be important during viral infection in mosquito cells . Using in vitro and in vivo infection models , we identified Culex Cul4 to be acting as pro - viral protein , increasing viral titers . Knockdown of Cul4 in Culex mosquitoes decreased viral titers in mosquito saliva . Identification of this novel immune evasion mechanism adopted by WNV provides new insights into transmission of arbovirus and interaction of WNV with its mosquito vector . host immunity , by degradation of immune proteins . For example , Kaposi ' s sarcoma - associated herpes virus ( KSHV ) immediate - early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7 , a key mediator of type I interferon induction , for proteasome - mediated degradation [ 27 ] . As an alternate strategy , viruses also encode adaptors that recruit and redirect host E3 ligases to ubiquitylate host proteins , leading to degradation . Adenoviruses express proteins which recruit a cullin - based E3 ligase to target p53 for degradation [ 28 ] . Several paramyxoviruses limit the activity of interferons by targeting STATs for ubiquitylation and degradation via interaction of their highly conserved V proteins and host Cul4A RING E3 ligase [ 29 , 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 749, "end": 769}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 815}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1101}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1264, "end": 1269}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1307}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1323, "end": 1334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1453, "end": 1464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1592}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1602, "end": 1606}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1677, "end": 1689}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1702, "end": 1708}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1768, "end": 1796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1800, "end": 1826}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 116}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 150}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 449}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1639, "end": 1655}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 21, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
