Using immunohistochemistry to survey FcRn protein expression at various sites in the human genital tract , we detected abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelial cells lining the human penile urethra ( Figure 5A and 5D ; Figure S7A and S7D ) and endocervix ( Figure 5B and 5E ; Figure S7B and S7E ) . In contrast , little to no FcRn protein was observed in vaginal / ectocervical squamous epithelia , and expression occurred only in the basal epithelial layer ( Figure 5C and 5F ; Figure S7C ) . A similar staining pattern was observed in foreskin tissue ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 228}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 428, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 499}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 5, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
