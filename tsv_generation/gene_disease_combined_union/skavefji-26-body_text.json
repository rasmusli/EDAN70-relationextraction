{"cord_uid": "skavefji", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4019586", "divid": "26", "text": "The study has several limitations . First , the small sample size of the select critically ill patient population analyzed limits the general applicability of our findings . Moreover , since our study included critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy , our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe pneumonia patients in clinical practice . Second , the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin , remains to be further elucidated . Third , cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia , and mycobacterial pneumonia , were not included , mainly because few patients had these types of pneumonia . Fourth , patients with non - infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates that can often mimic infectious causes , such as acute respiratory distress syndrome , cryptogenic organizing pneumonia , eosinophilic pneumonia , and drug - induced pneumonitis , were also excluded from our analyses . The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria . Finally , all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid . Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means , such as blood culture , endotracheal aspirates culture , urinary pneumococcal antigen test , and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples , as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was demonstrated . Therefore , patients with coincidental upper respiratory infections or colonization may have been included .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1448}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 225}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 265}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 288}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 405}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 662}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 806}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 880}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 929, "end": 965}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 1000}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1025}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1627, "end": 1656}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
