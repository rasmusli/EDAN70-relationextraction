Following the discovery , in the 1980s , of the increased risk of schizophrenia after maternal influenza infection 37 , models of viral - like immune activation by polyriboinosinic - polyribocytidilic acid ( poly ( I : C ) ) have been widely studied 33 , 38 , 39 . In addition , models of bacterial - like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and behavioral abnormalities in offspring , similar to the poly ( I : C ) models 38 . However , with respect to neurotoxicity , LPS exposure may have a stronger effect on the fetal brain than poly ( I : C ) exposure 29 . Thus , the type of pathogen is important for the pattern of neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the offspring , and the timing and dose of the pathogen ' s administration , in addition to the strain or species , may also have an influence . The present model of prenatal exposure to LPS led to impairments in short - term memory and social interaction at 3 to 4 weeks after birth .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 431}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 656, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 804}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 164}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 204}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 288}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 323}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 626}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 911}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
