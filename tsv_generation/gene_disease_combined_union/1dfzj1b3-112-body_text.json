Citral exhibited an inhibitory activity in LPS - induced iNOS protein expression , not found for COX - 2 . The authors studied the effect of citral on NF - \u03baB pathway for enlightening the mechanism of the citralmediated inhibition of iNOS transcription . The authors concluded that citral could prevent the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in LPS - induced inflammation and reduce the p50 NF - \u03baB levels in nuclear fractions [ 121 ] . In another study , it was reported that in human macrophage - like U937 cells , citral suppressed both LPS - induced COX - 2 mRNA and protein expression , dose - dependently . Moreover , citral induced the mRNA expression of the PPAR\u03b1 and the PPAR\u03b3 , suggesting that citral activates PPAR\u03b1 and\u03b3 , and regulates COX - 2 expression [ 147 ] . A same behaviour was observed for carvacrol .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 249}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 292}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 346}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 426}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 712, "end": 716}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 838, "end": 844}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 858}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 893, "end": 904}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 928}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
