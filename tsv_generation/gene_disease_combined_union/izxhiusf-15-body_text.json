Samples were considered representative of the lower airways , if > 40 % of instilled volume was recovered and if < 1 % of nucleated cells are squamous epithelial cells on smear . Undiluted and 1 \u03bcL of a 1 / 1000 dilution of BAL - fluid were inoculated on blood agar supplemented with X and V factors incubated at 35 \u00b0 C in 5 % CO 2 , MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar incubated at 35 \u00b0 C in air . Growth was assessed after 24 h , and after 48 h in case of no growth at 24 h . Results were reported in semi - quantitative terms , with a growth of potential pathogens of \u2265 10 4 cfu / ml considered significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 480}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
