{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "5", "text": "Analyses of the prevalence , length , and thickness of myocardial extensions has resulted in conflicting reports as to whether various parameters do ( Hassink et al . 2003 ; Kholov\u00e1 and Kautzner 2003 ) or do not ( Kholov\u00e1 and Kautzner 2004 ; Saito et al . 2000 ) correlate with atrial fibrillation . However , mutations in genes encoding the transcription factors Nkx2 - 5 ( Huang et al . 2013 ; Xie et al . 2013 ) , Pitx2c ( Qiu et al . 2014 ; Wang et al . 2014 ) , and GATA6 ) are all associated with atrial fibrillation ; these genes are known to be required for cardiovascular development . These data suggest that perturbation of the transcriptional program associated with cardiac muscle ( but not necessarily disrupting morphology ) may underlie the association of the pulmonary myocardium with atrial fibrillation . Consistent with this , both PITX2C and NKX2 - 5 are required to direct and maintain the identity of the pulmonary myocardium ( Mommersteeg et al . 2007 ) . Lost or reduced expression of NKX2 - 5 causes pulmonary myocardium cells to adopt a pacemaker - like phenotype similar to cells of the sinus horn myocardium , without altering cellular morphology ( Mommersteeg et al . 2007 ; Ye et al . 2015 ) . This implies that healthy pulmonary myocardium could gain pacemaker function from which an ectopic beat might originate via a shift in the gene expression program away from that of working myocardium and toward a pacemaker program . Thus , molecular analysis of pulmonary myocardium cells in vivo is warranted and could provide a powerful tool for understanding the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation and identifying novel therapeutic targets . This led us to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms that might drive the expression of cardiac genes in this tissue .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 424}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 477}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 859}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 863, "end": 872}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1019}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1760, "end": 1774}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 298}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 523}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 822}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1607, "end": 1627}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
