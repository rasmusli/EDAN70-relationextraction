First , this systematic review relied upon published peer - reviewed literature . This overlooked documents , such as WHO reports , government documents , and books , which might have contained relevant information . For example , we are aware of critical texts in the form of books , which may have enriched this manuscript - specifically , Ng ( 2008 ) and Teo , Yeoh , and Ong ( 2008 ) provide insight into how other cities affected by SARs attributed responsibility , talked about attribution of risk and responsibility for the disease ; ( Teo et al . 2008 ; Ali 2008 ) Teo , Yeoh , and Ong ( 2008 ) point to Singapore ' s attribution of responsibility and credibility of evidence ; ( Keil and Ali 2008 ) , while Keil and Ali ( 2008 ) also note the racialization of the SARS epidemic in Toronto , reflecting on the stigmatization of Toronto ' s Chinese and South Asian communities ( King 2008 ) . However , King ' s ( 2008 ) work positions globalization as both responsible for causing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks ( Ali et al . 2016 ) , such narratives are thought to create space to better understand how such processes might be repurposed as public health solutions . Finally , Ali , Dumbuya , Hynie , Idahosa , Keil , and Perkins ( 2016 ) ground the Ebola outbreak in Liberia in the context of colonial legacies , specifically emphasizing that global public health responses were political in that the establishment of the public health infrastructure tasked with responding to Ebola was influenced by social inequality , colonialism , and racism ( ) . By adopting a social science perspective , Ali et al . ( 2016 ) unpack the diverse factorssocial , political , environmental , medical , and legal - that facilitated the escalation of the Ebola crisis ( ) . However , since the scope of this paper was limited to peer - reviewed journal publications and one outbreak from each income context as an illustration , such information ( from books and from other contexts ) although relevant , was beyond the paper ' s scope .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 842}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 1071, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 1339, "end": 1345}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1573}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1830, "end": 1843}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
