Separate full - length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein , nonstructural protein , or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain ( genotype 1b ) RNA by RT - PCR . Each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI / p7 . 5 hybrid promoter ; the final designation of each recombinant plasmid was pBMSF7C - CN2 , pBMSF7C - N25 , or pBMSF - CN5 ( Figure 2 ) . They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 ( multiplicity of infection = 10 ) . The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping ; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use . The hemagglutinin - negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [ 42 ] and named rVV - CN2 , rVV - N25 , or rVV - CN5 . Insertion of the HCV protein genes into the LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR , and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis . The titers of rVV - CN2 , rVV - N25 , and rVV - CN5 were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 85}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 299}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 345}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 482, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 589}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1015}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1030}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1076, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1235, "end": 1245}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 138}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
