Mice were transcardially perfused with dPBS , and then , the spleen , brain , popliteal LNs , and femur were removed . Bone marrow was collected from the femur by centrifuging the bone in a 0 . 65 - ml microtube punctured with an 18G needle nested inside a 1 . 7 - ml tube . Brain tissue was minced and digested in a HBSS ( Gibco ) containing 0 . 05 % collagenase D ( Sigma ) , 0 . 1 \u03bcg / ml TLCK trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma ) , 10 \u03bcg / ml DNase I ( Sigma ) , and 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 ( Gibco ) for 1 h at 22 \u00b0 C with shaking . Brain , spleen , and LN tissues were pushed through a 70 - \u03bcm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 10 min . Brain cell pellets were resuspended in 37 % isotonic Percoll ( GE healthcare ) and centrifuged at 1200g for 30 min to remove myelin debris , and pellet was resuspended in dPBS . Red blood cells were lysed in blood , spleen , and bone marrow samples with ACK lysing buffer ( Gibco ) for 5 min , then centrifuged at 500g for 10 min and resuspended in dPBS . Prior to immunostaining , all cells were blocked with 1 : 50", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 529}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
