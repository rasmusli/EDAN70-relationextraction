{"cord_uid": "klnsklr3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC2699471", "divid": "7", "text": "To investigate the mechanism of lymphocyte activation following LDV infection we first analyzed the kinetics of CD69 upregulation on splenic lymphocytes at several time points following infection . CD69 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [ 16 ] and became detectable at 14 hours post - infection , peaked at 16 to 24 hours , and returned almost to background levels by 72 hours ( Figure 1A ) . The induction of CD69 occurred on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , as well as B cells ( Figure 1B ) . In addition to the spleen , CD69 upregulation was also observed , albeit to a lesser extent , on lymphocytes from the blood , lymph nodes , and bone marrow ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the thymus , which are primarily immature T cells . In contrast to CD69 , the IL - 2 receptor alpha chain ( CD25 ) , which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on TCR ligation [ 21 ] , did not increase in expression during the first day of LDV infection ( data not shown ) . This result is consistent with partial rather than full activation of the lymphocytes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 447}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 845, "end": 873}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 880}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 971}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 78}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T8", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
