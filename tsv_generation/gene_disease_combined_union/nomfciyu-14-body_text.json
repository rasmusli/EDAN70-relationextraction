Development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to contain their infections is an urgent need , and yet currently no antiviral treatments against MERS - CoV are available . MERS - CoV is known to interact with host cell surface receptor DPP4 or CD26 with its spike S protein , which subsequently leads to its entry in the host cell [ 61 ] . Our knowledge regarding the exact mechanisms that follow thereafter is still limited and requires more research . Due to lack of definite treatment , supportive therapy remains the only solution . Present development consists of the previous experiences of other coronavirus diseases like SARS - CoV , which have been studied in in vitro and in vivo models . Tremendous efforts are being made in this direction and various antiviral and related therapies have been identified . Use of humanized monoclonal antibodies , convalescent plasma and therapeutic peptides has been shown efficacious . Repurposing of the currently available drugs is also being tried to extend their efficacy against MERS - CoV . Some potential options are discussed in detail below .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 398}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 1006}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 305}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 752, "end": 773}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 1180, "end": 1191}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
