In addition , an epidemic curve was developed using published reports to identify the dates of onset for the MERS - CoV cases in KSA . 3 , 4 MERS - CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay A MERS - CoV spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector was constructed and provided by the laboratory of Malik Peiris of Hong Kong University . This assay is considered to be a more sensitive test compare to virus neutralization assay . 6 , 7 The MERS - S pseudoparticles were used in a pseudoparticle neutralization test ( ppNT ) as first described elsewhere . 6 In brief , the ppNT assay included infecting monolayers of Vero E6 cells ( ATCC CRL - 1586 ) in a single well ( 96 - well plate format ; 1 9 10 4 cells / well ) with HIV - MERS - S - pseudotyped lentiviral vector having 5 ng p24 . The MERS - S pseudoparticles were pre - incubated with serially diluted sera for 60 min at 4 \u00b0 C and then added to the cells in triplicate . After 2 days of incubation , 100 ll of luciferase substrate , ONE - Glo luciferase Assay System ( Promega Madison , WI , USA ) , was added . The relative level of MERS - S pseudoparticle infection of the cells as luciferase activity was measured in a BioTek Synergy MX multimode plate reader ( BioTek , Winooski , VT . Endpoint MERS - CoV neutralizing antibodies titers were determined as the highest serum dilution resulting in 90 % reduction of luciferase relative to a negative serum ( BSA ) control . Polyclonal rabbit antisera to MERS - CoV obtained from the NIH / NIAID Rocky Mountain Research Laboratory was used as a positive control . Sensitivity of the assay in our laboratory was compared to that of the Peiris Laboratory at University of Hong Kong , where it was developed , by shipping an aliquot of this positive control which was independently titrated in the ppNT assay . Both our and Peiris ' laboratory found the neutralizing titer of the polyclonal rabbit sera to be comparable to that measured by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories live virus neutralization assay ( 1 : 2560 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 893}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1086}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1364, "end": 1399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1483, "end": 1494}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 224}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
