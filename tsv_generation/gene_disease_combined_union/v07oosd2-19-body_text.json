{"cord_uid": "v07oosd2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5437690", "divid": "19", "text": "Pathogenesis of porcine enteric colibacillosis has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 7 , 40 , 57 ] . Indeed , piglets ingest ETEC found in their environment , especially derived from mammary glands of their mother and from the farrowing room or from the pen environment on arrival in the nursery ( Fig . 2 ) . These ETEC originate from the gut of piglets with ETEC diarrhea , or subclinical carrier animals at the farm [ 57 ] . ETEC bacteria adhere to pig ' s small intestinal epithelium , causes an increase of water and electrolytes secretion into the intestinal lumen generated by the release of enterotoxins , and alter the functions of enterocytes by increasing secretion and reducing absorption [ 7 ] . Excessive secretion of electrolytes and water leads to dehydration , metabolic acidosis , osmotic diarrhea and possible death [ 28 , [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . It has been widely reported in the scientific literature that ETEC challenge in pigs was not associated with significant macroscopic lesions or morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa resulting from the toxic activity of ETEC enterotoxins [ 57 , 61 , 62 ] . However , other studies have reported that the necropsy of challenged pigs with ETEC or naturally infected animals , has revealed several lesions such as ; dehydration , dilation of the stomach and the small intestines , gastric infarcts in the mucosa of the stomach , and congestion of the mucosa of both the small intestine and the colon [ 57 , 63 ] . Furthermore , ETEC infections in pigs may also result in a shock syndrome with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis , congestion , renal hemorrhage , and thrombi in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] . Moreover , intestinal ETEC infections in pigs might be associated with secondary septicemia [ 66 ] and inactivation of the hemolysin structural gene ( hlyA ) of an ETEC : F4 challenge strain did not decrease the incidence of this septicemia in orally challenged gnotobiotic piglets [ 66 ] . Thus , macroscopic lesions of shock syndrome and septicemia related to ETEC infection in the post weaning period in pigs are probably the consequence of the rapid release of bacterial LPS from the pig ' s intestine into the systemic circulation [ 57 ] . On the other hand , microscopically , ETEC challenge in pigs has been associated with a greater villous atrophy and a large crypt depth reduction in all segments of the intestine of challenged animals [ 67 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 616}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1848, "end": 1874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1876, "end": 1881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 47}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 378}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 780}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 801}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 820}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1302, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1316, "end": 1365}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1367, "end": 1413}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1486}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1530}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1559, "end": 1574}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1607}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1609, "end": 1620}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1622, "end": 1639}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1645, "end": 1702}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1736, "end": 1763}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1806, "end": 1817}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1955, "end": 1966}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 2046, "end": 2061}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 2065, "end": 2076}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
