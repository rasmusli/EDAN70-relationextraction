Although basal TLR9 expression was similar in the PBMCs of the cats of all age groups ( Figure 2F ) , ODN 2216 stimulation increased TLR9 transcription in the cells of kittens , but decreased transcription of this gene in the cells of adult cats so that differences in the mRNA levels of this receptor were significantly higher in young cats ( group 1 ) than in adult cats of groups 2 and 3 ( p = 0 . 0286 ) ( Figure 2G ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 362}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
