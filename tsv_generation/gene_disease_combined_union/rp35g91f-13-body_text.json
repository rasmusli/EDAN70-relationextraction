The top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole - lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph . This resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation . 0 . 8 . ( A ) These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed to interrogate relationships at Pearson correlation values between 0 . 7 and 1 . 0 ( red lines ) and between 0 . 5 and 0 . 7 ( orange lines ) . ( B ) The functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified . All proteins except DOC2G and MYBPHL had known roles in cardiac function including structural sarcomeric proteins , regulation of sarcomere assembly , ion transport , transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation , and hormone signaling .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 96}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 476}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1041, "end": 1072}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
