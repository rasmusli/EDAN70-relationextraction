This important observation indicated that rVV - N25 - induced HCV clearance was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells . Many studies have shown that spontaneous viral clearance during acute HCV infection is characterized by a vigorous , broadly reactive CD4 and CD8 T - cell response . [ 8 , 22 ] HCV clearance and hepatocellular cytotoxicity are both mediated by CD8 antigenspecific ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte ) CTLs [ 23 ] . Consistent with these observations , rVV - N25 treatment effectively induced the accumulation of NS2 - specific CD8 T cells , which express high levels of Figure 6 . Immunization with rVV - N25 suppresses serum inflammatory cytokine levels . ( A ) Daily cytokine levels in the serum of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice during the week following immunization with LC16m8 , rVV - CN2 , rVV - N25 , or rVV - CN5 . Values represent means 6 SD ( n = 3 ) and reflect the concentrations relative to those measured on day 0 . The broken lines indicate the baseline data from wild - type mice . In all cases , n = 6 mice per group . ( B ) Liver sections from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) and CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice . ( C ) Histology activity index ( HAI ) scores of liver samples taken from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) , or CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice . ( D ) Liver sections from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice in which TNF - a was neutralized and the IL - 6 receptor was blocked . The scale bars indicate 50 mm . ( E ) HAI scores of liver samples taken from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) in which TNF - a was neutralized and the IL - 6 receptor was blocked . Tg and non - Tg indicate CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) and CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) , respectively . ( F ) Macrophages were the main producers of TNF - a and IL - 6 in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice following poly ( I : C ) injection . ( G ) Immunization with rVV - N25 reduced the number of macrophages in liver samples from CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice and suppressed TNF - a and IL - 6 production from macrophages ( Figure 6G ) .
