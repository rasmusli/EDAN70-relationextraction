It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis , angiogenesis and T - cell function , which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome ( 18 ) . Changes in platelet morphology , with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction , may occur in chronic liver diseases , and thrombocytes are activated in chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis . Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with liver cirrhosis has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls ( 19 ) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis . In the present study , levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure . This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 641}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 747, "end": 775}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 953}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 384}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 443}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 530}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 712}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 836}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 994}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 12, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
