These consensus - level variations across the samples occurred in all five genes of the rabies genome as well as four intergenic regions ( Fig . S2 ) . The intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus - level mutations compared to the 5 genes , with the region between G and L being the most variable ( 0 . 06 mutations per nucleotide , Table 1 The intergenic region between G and L remained the most variable , followed by the intergenic region between P and M . The M protein had the highest rate of consensus - level variation across all samples , but the G protein had the highest rate of consensuslevel variation in the outbreak samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 36}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 594}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 655, "end": 673}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 681, "end": 689}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 695, "end": 705}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 310}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
