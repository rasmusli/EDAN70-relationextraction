Then for each RNA sequence we run our methods on all 50 suboptimal structures and choose the one with the lowest free energy as the final result for that RNA sequence . With this approach , the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence interval of average F - measure of HFold and Iterative HFold is ( 61 . 80 % , 80 . 63 % ) and ( 67 . 70 % , 79 . 57 % ) respectively for pseudoknotted structures and ( 77 . 17 % , 82 . 35 % ) and ( 76 . 27 % , 81 . 46 % ) respectively for pseudoknot - free structures . The permutation test indicates that the difference between these results and the corresponding results when input structures are hotspots is not significant . We also test the significance of results of HFold with first 50 suboptimal structures versus Iterative HFold with the same input structures and Iterative HFold with hotspots for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures . Although the bootstrap 95 % percentile confidence intervals for average F - measures seem different , the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant . Similarly , results of Iterative HFold with the first 50 suboptimal structures are not significantly better or worse than the result of HFold with hotspots as input structures for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot - free structures .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 211}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 476}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 577}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 665}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 930}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 998, "end": 1004}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1018}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1283, "end": 1289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1406}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
