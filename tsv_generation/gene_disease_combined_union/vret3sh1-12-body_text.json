The Annotation Support Server accepts either DNA or protein sequence as input and , depending on the user options , can either use existing gene calls or invoke standard gene callers ( e . g . , GLIMMER - 3 for protein - encoding genes ) . The server also houses newly developed high - performance methods to assign function to protein sequences or regions of genomic DNA sequences , based on FIGfams [ 22 ] . Below is an example application using these methods that produces a relatively accurate annotation of most microbial genomes within a few minutes . To evaluate the technology , users are encouraged to simply submit a known prokaryotic genome to the server for annotation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 406}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 585}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 604}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 738}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 855}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
