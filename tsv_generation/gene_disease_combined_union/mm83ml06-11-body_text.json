Lysates were adjusted to 1 % SDS ( w / v ) and incubated at 95 \u2022 C for 10 min , subsequently diluted to 0 . 1 % SDS and were then cleared by centrifugation at 20 , 000 \u00d7 g for 10 min . Gag content was recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies derived from HIV - 1 patient sera pre - bound to GammaBind Plus Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) . For detection of ubiquitinated Gag proteins directly by western blotting , RIPA lysis buffer was supplemented with 20 \u00b5M lactacystin and 20 \u00b5M carbobenzoxyl - leucine - leucine - leucinal .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 286}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 368}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
