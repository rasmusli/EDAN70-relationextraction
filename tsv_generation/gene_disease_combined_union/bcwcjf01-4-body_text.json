{"cord_uid": "bcwcjf01", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3836733", "divid": "4", "text": "Different RABV variants are associated with different reservoir hosts and geographical locations . Typically , interspecies transmission of rabies virus from reservoir to non - reservoir host produces a single fatal spillover event ; secondary transmission has rarely been observed [ 7 ] . For example , a bat variant may infect and cause disease in skunks , but it does not transmit efficiently within the skunk population and skunks would be considered a ' ' dead - end host ' ' for this variant . The exception to this would be the case of cross - species transmission ( CST ) where the variant from one species adapts to transmission by a new species [ 8 ] . For example , in 2001 , bat variant rabies adapted to transmission within the skunk population in Flagstaff Arizona [ 9 ] , and in 2009 this variant adapted to transmission by foxes [ 7 ] . These events demonstrate the capacity of rabies virus for CST which may lead to increased exposure of humans to the pathogen and increase the geographical range of the virus .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 147}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 699, "end": 706}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 901}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
