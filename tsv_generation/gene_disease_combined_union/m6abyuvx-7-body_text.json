As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum ALT levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly ( I : C ) injection ; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the poly ( I : C ) treatment , which causes liver injury [ 11 ] . After this peak , serum ALT levels dropped continuously until day 4 , and then ALT levels began to increase , as did HCV core protein levels . Thereafter , the HCV core protein was expressed consistently for at least 600 days .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 138, "end": 142}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 171}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 406}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
