Humoral responses are often thought to play a key role in controlling HCV infection [ 81 ] . In clinical setting , patients spontaneously resolving from acute HCV infection tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response . In contrast , chronic infection patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response . Moreover , the variety of strategies the virus evolves to escape antibodies - mediated neutralization , including the accelerated evolution and the diversity of HCV [ 82 ] . Overall , the capacity of HCV to mutate continuously allows a high plasticity and an ability of the virus to adapt to variable environmental conditions and escape the host ' s immune responses leading to HCV persistene . HCV entry to the hepatocytes requires interaction of its viral envelope glycoproteins ( E1 and E2 ) and the cell membrane [ 83 ] . Both E1 and E2 contain putative fusion domains [ 84 ] . While little is known about the role of E1 in HCV entry , several domains in E2 have been defined to bind to CD 81 and scavenger receptor class B type I ( SR - BI ) , two important host factors ( described in the next paragraph ) . These interactions through E2 glycoprotein help HCV evade host immune responses and enter the hepatocytes . For example , hypervariate region 1 ( HVR1 ) , the first 27 amino acids of E2 , plays an important role in viral fitness . It has been demonstrated that HVR1 was involved in SR - BI - mediated HCV entry [ 85 ] . Therefore , HVR1 has been suggested to be a target for neutralizing antibodies , but its high variability results in poor crossneutralization potency of antibodies across different HCV isolates [ 86 ] . It is well known that host humoral responses are thought to play a critical role in controlling HCV infection . Several studies reported that broadly neutralizing antibodies might be directed against conserved conformational epitopes within E2 and mostly inhibit E2 - CD81 interaction [ 87 , 88 ] . Currently , new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the N - terminal part of E2 [ 89 ] . The conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 815, "end": 844}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 849}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 904}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 936}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 988}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1022, "end": 1025}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1060}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1098}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1100, "end": 1108}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1323, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1342, "end": 1357}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1360, "end": 1363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1438, "end": 1443}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1509, "end": 1514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1552, "end": 1576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1650, "end": 1661}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1863, "end": 1874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1900, "end": 1934}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1941, "end": 1944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1966, "end": 1973}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 2081, "end": 2099}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 2102, "end": 2105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 93}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 192}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 292}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 32, "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 745}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 33, "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1682}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 34, "span": {"begin": 1796, "end": 1810}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T22", "obj": 33, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T21", "obj": 33, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T20", "obj": 33, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
