In fact , the latter factor proved important in 7 out of 24 faecal samples analysed when screening samples , when , despite apparently adequate amounts of DNA , no amplification for the PGK assay ( or either pathogen assay ) was recorded . In the absence of an IC , these samples could have been classed as negative and highlight that a differing extraction process is required for faecal samples .
