There are several free radicals that can be used ; nevertheless the fundamental principles involved may be the same . This method relies on the reduction of the blue - green cation radical of ABTS + \u2022 , by measuring the reduction of the radical cation as the percentage of inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm . The absorbance of the reaction mixture of ABTS and an antioxidant is compared to that of the Trolox \u00ae standard , and the results are expressed in terms of Trolox \u00ae equivalent antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) [ 59 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
