Admittedly , both the supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with CpG - A and serum of treated cats contain a mixture of molecules that could play a role in the observed antiviral effects . However , the viral inhibition in our in vitro assays was similar to that obtained after treatment of the cells with rfeIFN\u03b1 and highly correlated with the induction of Mx transcription in the cell lines incubated with the supernatants . After ODN 2216 injection in vivo , Mx expression in plasma also strongly correlated with its antiviral potential . It is however important to note that Mx mRNA and protein cannot be mechanistically linked to inhibition of the viruses tested . Although the expression of other antiviral molecules such as 2 ' 5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) and the RNA - dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) was not measured , their induction has been reported following CpG ODN stimulation of PBMCs in other species [ 77 , 78 ] and differential interplay between several effector mechanisms most likely leads to the inhibition of individual viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 108}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 543, "end": 546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 650}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 916, "end": 950}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 956}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 997}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 999, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1072}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 168}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
