{"cord_uid": "me1ajoyb", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3970152", "divid": "28", "text": "The use of cytokines or neutralizing cytokine antibodies to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance . For example , administration of IFN\u03b3 to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of LCMV , whereas antibody that neutralizes IFN\u03b3 impairs CTL responses and clearance , thus leading to persistent infection [ 110 , 111 ] . Depletion of immune cell subsets with antibodies can also determine the roles of those cells during infection . This approach revealed a critical role for CD4 + T cells for sustaining CTL responses to LCMV [ 112 ] . Other than the Norway rat , an array of cytokines and antibodies for experimental manipulation of the host response of hantavirus reservoirs is substantially limited . Thus , it is difficult to determine the mechanisms controlling the host response of reservoirs . Some cytokines are broadly cross - reactive and can be used for studying reservoir responses . Recombinant house mouse GM - CSF and human IL - 2 stimulate deer mouse cells [ 113 ] , and it is likely that other commercially - available cytokines can also be used . Identification of cross - reactive cytokines should be a high priority of the hantavirus community . With genome and transcriptome sequencing , many cytokine genes can be rapidly cloned into expression vectors that are codon - optimized for the expression system of choice using de novo synthesis services ( e . g . , GeneArt , Life Technologies ) . Moreover , some antibodies may be cross - reactive with reservoir species ' orthologs [ 114 ] . Anti - mouse CD4 ( clone GK1 . 5 ) and anti - rat CD8\u03b2 ( clone 341 ) antibodies can be used to deplete CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from hamsters , respectively [ 74 , 86 ] , and they may also be useful for reservoir host studies to examine the roles of these cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 658, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 888, "end": 898}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 1011}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1028}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1296, "end": 1311}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1553, "end": 1571}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1593, "end": 1626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1632, "end": 1662}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 270}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 608}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1236}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
