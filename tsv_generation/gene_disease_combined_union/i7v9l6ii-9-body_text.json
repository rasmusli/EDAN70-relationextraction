The Kan - r PCR fragment and RP DNA along with RP RNA PCR fragment were used as reaction control and sample control respectively . If control bands were absent , the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors . Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 52}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 122}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 289}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
