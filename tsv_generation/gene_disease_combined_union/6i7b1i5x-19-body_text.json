{"cord_uid": "6i7b1i5x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6514959", "divid": "19", "text": "Because the ICIs observed in KD specimens are identified by recombinant antibodies synthesized from pathologic KD specimens , the authors of these studies conclude that these inclusions are of viral origin , and specifically related to the etiological agent of KD [ 51 , 105 ] . However , it is possible that these ICIs could be any number of host - derived functional structures that are typically observed as protein aggregates . Aggresomes , one such structure , are involved in shuttling of misfolded proteins during cellular stress [ 111 ] . Aggresomes are frequently observed as large intracellular aggregates of host proteins and are frequently surrounded by a \" cage \" of intermediate filament proteins . Available evidence suggests KD ICIs and aggresomes are distinct structures since the ICIs observed in the two autopsy specimens lacked a cytokeratin cage [ 103 ] . However , cytokeratin cages are not definitive of aggresomes and their presence may depend on the cell type . More frequently , vimentin is used as an intermediate filament marker for aggresomal cages . Because the expression of vimentin varies in bronchiole epithelial cells [ 112 ] , other common markers of aggresomes could have been studied , such as ubiquitin , HSP70 , HSP40 , and proteasomal subunits [ 111 ] . Unfortunately , none of these markers were tested . In addition , there are several other large intracellular protein aggregates such as stress granules , p - bodies , prion - aggregates , aggresome - like induced structures ( ALIS ) and autophagosomes [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] . It is possible the ICI identified by antibodies A and J are one of these structures ; perhaps the manifestation of KD is the improper regulation of one of these processes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 83}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 633}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 711}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 764}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 862}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 938}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1028, "end": 1057}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1106, "end": 1115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1187, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1244, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1264, "end": 1285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1627, "end": 1646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 32}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 114}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 264}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 744}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1705, "end": 1708}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 20, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
