We observed that medium from Laos strain - infected NEC induced a significant increase of porcine monocyte migration ( Fig . 6D ) . supernatants were collected and IL - 8 levels were determined by ELISA . The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate . Data are shown as 25 % to 75 % interquartile boxes with means and 95 % confidence intervals . Different superscript letters indicate significant difference ( P [UNK] 0 . 05 ) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain ( letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama , respectively ) ; differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks ( * , P [UNK] 0 . 05 ; * * , P [UNK] 0 . 002 ; * * * , P [UNK] 0 . 001 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 261}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 50}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 566, "end": 570}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 693, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
