{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "15", "text": "Coimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both ORF2 and myc tagged full - length \u03b2TRCP revealed that ORF2 could efficiently associate with the latter ( Figure 4A , upper panel , lane 2 ) . Exposure of the same blot to X - ray film revealed the band specific to ORF2 in \u03b2TRCP and ORF2 cotransfected cells ( Figure 4A , lower panel , lane 2 ) . 3 rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the \u03b2TRCP protein , as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti - myc antibody . Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F - box protein , SKP2 . We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 4B , top panel ) . In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments , the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti - myc antibody . Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c - myc protein ( Figure 4B , middle panel ) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein ( Figure 4B transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody , pre - immune serum ( PS ) or anti - ORF2 antibodies , respectively ; subsequently , samples were immunoblotted with SKP1 and CUL1 antibodies . Same blot was air dried and exposed to X - ray film to check for ORF2 expression by autoradiography .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 99}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 118}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 278}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 483}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 608}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 615}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 671}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 680}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 773, "end": 778}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 888}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 906}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 968, "end": 984}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1083, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1213, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1236, "end": 1262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1265, "end": 1288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1352, "end": 1377}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1449}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
