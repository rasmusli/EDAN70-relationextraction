( DOC ) Alignment S2 Bat PARP4 largest exon . Regions in grey were removed from positive selection analyses due to low confidence in the alignment . Residues highlighted in yellow have evolved under positive selection with a posterior probability . 0 . 95 ( See Table S5 ) . The bottom line in each block indicates conservation across all species , with asterisks indicating identical residues and colons representing similar residues . Representative viral macrodomains were aligned to individual macrodomains from human macro - PARPs . Three motifs noted by Jankevicius et al . [ 16 ] to be critical for coordination of ADPr by macrodomains are boxed . Red residues match the conserved consensus sequences at these positions . Asterisks indicate the residues most important for catalytic removal of ADPr from a substrate protein . The lack of conservation of these residues in many of the macro - PARP domains suggests they may be able to bind , but not catalyze removal of , ADPr . ( PDF ) Figure S6 Phylogenetic tree of intact vertebrate PARP14 and PARP15 genes . PARP14 and PARP15 genes from vertebrates were aligned as described in Materials and Methods being careful to include only open - reading frames that were uninterrupted by frameshifts or stop codons . Some otherwise intact genes are omitted from the tree because one or more exons are missing due to assembly gaps . The maximum likelihood tree generated from these sequences is shown with bootstrap values indicated . We note that the position of marsupial PARP14 - like sequences in this tree implies that the partial PARP14 duplication that gave rise to PARP15 occurred before the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals ; however , we have seen no evidence for the presence of PARP15 in marsupial genomes , and the use of alternate phylogeny inference parameters places the PARP14 - 15 duplication after ma - placental mammal divergence . We therefore conservatively suggest that the PARP14 - 15 duplication occurred after marsupial - placental mammal divergence , rather than the less parsimonious possibility that the duplication occurred earlier and that PARP15 was subsequently lost in the marsupial ancestor . ( PDF ) Figure S7 Sliding window analyses of recently duplicated PARP14 paralogs . A sliding window dN / dS analysis ( window size 150 codons , step size 50 codons ) of PARP14 paralogs from microbat ( A ) and bushbaby ( B ) with the PARP14 domain structure indicated below . The grey horizontal line marks a dN / dS value of 1 , indicating neutral evolution . The bushbaby genes fall in a gapped region of the genome assembly , resulting in a central region of the alignment being unreliable and therefore excluded from analysis .
