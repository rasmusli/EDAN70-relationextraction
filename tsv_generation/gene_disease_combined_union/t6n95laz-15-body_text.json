CRP is able to activate complement and enhance phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and injured , necrotic and apoptotic cells . Therefore , CRP is important in natural immunity ( 12 , 13 ) . Originally , CRP was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation ; however , following ~ 10 years of investigation , it has been demonstrated that CRP participates in inflammation and atherosclerosis directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor ( 14 ) . In this study , it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were decreased in the patients with CHB and markedly increased in the patients with ACLF . Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin \u03b2 chain variant Hb S - Wake , which has been implicated in in orphan diseases ( 15 ) , although not in liver diseases .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 907}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 557}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 561, "end": 577}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 770}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 814, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 957}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 997}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
