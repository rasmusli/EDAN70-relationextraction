Mice were monitored for sign development on a daily basis . Mice treated with isotype antibody exhibited visible hair loss associated with scurfy skin peaked on Day 6 post infection , and the skin scurf / rash gradually disappeared after Day 7 post infection . Administration of N3 to E59 - preinfected mice reduced the skin lesions to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards ( Figs . 2A and 2B ) . Moreover , prechallenge of 7 - day old hSCARB2 - transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu 5746 [ 11 ] caused progressive limb paralysis from Day 4 onwards and led to death if the mice remained untreated or isotype antibody treated ( Figs . 3A and 3B ) . Mice receiving N3 treatment 3 h post infection were protected from the development of paralysis and were subsequently rescued from lethal infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 394}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 581}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 931, "end": 948}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 422}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 491, "end": 502}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 509}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 632}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 861}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1075}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
