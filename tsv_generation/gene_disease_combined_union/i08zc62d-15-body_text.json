{"cord_uid": "i08zc62d", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4014123", "divid": "15", "text": "Comparison of the structures of sialidases from bacteria ( Crennell et al . , 1993 ( Crennell et al . , , 1994 Gaskell et al . , 1995 ) , viruses ( Varghese et al . , 1983 ; Burmeister et al . , 1993 ; Crennell et al . , 2000 ) and humans ( Chavas et al . , 2005 ) suggested that sialidases share a highly conserved active site located within the six - bladed - propeller fold ( Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme , we determined the structure of Cp - NanI in complex with diplacone . The structure of Cp - NanI CD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures . The - propeller fold within the apo structure ( PDB entry 2vk5 ; Newstead et al . , 2008 ) and the structure of Cp - NanI in complex with the substrate Neu5Ac ( N - acetylneuraminic acid ; PDB entry 2bf6 ; Newstead et al . , 2008 ) show root - meansquare deviations ( r . m . s . d . s ) relative to our structure of 0 . 12 and 0 . 11 \u00c5 , respectively ( Figs . 2a and 3a ) . Consistent with our kinetic analysis , diplacone was bound to the enzyme active site . The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . The 3 0 , 4 0 , 5 , 7 0 - hydroxyl - 4 - oxo group and the O atom at the 1 - position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the tri - arginyl cluster ( Arg266 , Arg555 and Arg615 ) as well as residues Arg285 , Asp328 , Phe353 , Tyr485 , Gln493 , Thr538 , Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292 , in addition to three water molecules ( W1 , W2 and W3 ) ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327 , Phe347 , Phe460 , Tyr485 and Tyr655 , which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 291}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 377}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 593}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 705}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 720}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 806}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 843}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1443, "end": 1450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1452, "end": 1459}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1463, "end": 1470}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
