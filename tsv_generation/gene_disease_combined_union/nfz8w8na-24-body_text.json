At the global level , it was the poorer countries and communities within those regions that were most impacted : those with precarious and / or inconsistent access to health care services , lacking the resources and infrastructure to prevent , diagnose , and treat the virus ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ; Slavov et al . 2016 ) . No wonder the impact of the outbreak was more devastating in Brazil , which was already financially strained prior to the emergence of the Zika virus , with limited human resources : doctors , nurses , and other specialists ( Hennigan 2016 ) , as compared to higher income countries who were more protected from the effects of the Zika virus given effective prevention programs , funding , and infrastructure ( Gyawali et al . 2016 ) . Easy and extensive access to mosquito repellants , air conditioning , effective waste management programs , and low rates of urban crowding protect more economically developed countries , such as the USA from Zika transmission ( Plourde and Bloch 2016 ) . Consequently , Zika virus has aptly been labeled an Binfectious disease of poverty ^ ( Gyawali et al . , 2016 , p . 3 ) ( Gyawali et al . 2016 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 75}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 640}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 821, "end": 832}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 1135, "end": 1140}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 1197, "end": 1208}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1234, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
