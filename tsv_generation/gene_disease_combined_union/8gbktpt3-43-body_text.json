Co - infection with other pathogens including Feline coronavirus or Giardia spp . could account for the clinical signs in five of these cases , which , although consistent with FPL , were non - specific . However , in one cat , high loads of vaccine strain virus were detected concurrently in lymph node and faeces ( FPV _ 221 , Table 3 ) , which is more consistent with loads attained by pathogenic virus strains than with those attained by vaccine virus strains . Further , unequivocal support of the diagnosis of FPL in this case was obtained from histological examination of the intestine , where lesions pathognomonic for FPL were identified ( Figure 5 ) . An FPV - vaccine strain was detected in this cat , and the sequencing chromatogram showed no evidence of a coinfecting FPV or CPV . However , deep sequencing of the sample with examination of the metatranscriptome or metagenome would be required to rule out co - infection with other pathogenic viruses not included in the qPCR test panel . An alternative explanation is that there was reversion to virulence of the vaccine strain , although this has not been described previously in cats .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 33}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1027}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1030, "end": 1041}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 328, "end": 332}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 671}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 778, "end": 782}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 943}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
