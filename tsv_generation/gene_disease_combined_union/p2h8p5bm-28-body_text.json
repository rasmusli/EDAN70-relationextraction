Mice lacking IFNAR all succumbed within 6 days of infection , whereas 80 % of WT mice ( 6 - 8 - week - old ) survived the infection . Interestingly , all IFN\u03b2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice survived the infection , demonstrating that the IFN\u03b1s can compensate for loss of IFN\u03b2 in LGTV infection . Furthermore , IFNAR was shown to be a critical determinant of LGTV tropism as LGTV RNA was found in all organs in the absence of IFNAR , whereas in WT , only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [ 99 , 128 , 141 ] . Using transgenic mice , it was further shown that the IFN response was needed both in the peripheral tissue , as well as locally in the CNS , in order to clear LGTV infection [ 99 , 100 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 8}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 357}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 397}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 464}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 99}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 375}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 528}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 787}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 11, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T8", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T7", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
