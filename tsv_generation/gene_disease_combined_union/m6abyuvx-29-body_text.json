Notably , even with rVV - N25 immunization , the frequency of activated CD8 T cells was very low , and a minimum of 2 - weeks incubation was required to distinguish the difference between rVV treatments . Even if a small population of specific CD8 + T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of core protein , it is difficult to assert that the only NS2specific CD8 + T cells were important to this reduction . However , based on the results presented in Figure 4B , we are able to conclude that at least CD8 + and / or CD4 + T cells were important to the reduction in HCV core protein . Therefore , to elucidate the mechanism of HCV protein clearance , further investigation of not only the other T cell epitopes but also other immunocompetent cells is required .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 335, "end": 348}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 754}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 613}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
