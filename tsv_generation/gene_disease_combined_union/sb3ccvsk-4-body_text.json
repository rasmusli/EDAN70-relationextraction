{"cord_uid": "sb3ccvsk", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5030268", "divid": "4", "text": "To assess how Foxp3 + Treg depletion affects endogenous SR T cells during JHMV persistence , we chose DEREG mice , which express the human diphtheria toxin ( DT ) receptor under the control of the Foxp3 promoter ( 22 ) . Incomplete DT - mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effects of Foxp3 + Treg ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of lymphoproliferative disease and systemic lethal autoimmunity ( 23 , 24 ) . DT treatment of JHMV - infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration ( between days 21 and 28 post infection ) , resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN , coincident with elevated pro - inflammatory cytokine expression compared to DT - treated controls . More importantly , Foxp3 + Treg ablation specifically increased frequencies of myelin - specific but not virus - specific CD4 + T cells , indicating preferential regulation of peripheral SR T cells by Foxp3 + Tregs . Surprisingly however , CNS inflammation , viral persistence , and demyelination remained similar consistent with no changes in virus and myelin - specific CD4 + T cells within the CNS . The apparent redundant role of Foxp3 + Tregs in regulating CNS inflammation implied a potential protective function of Tr1 cells . Analysis of SR T cells during chronic JHMV infection of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 mice , which lack Tr1 cells , revealed no effects within the CLN . By contrast , both virus - specific and SR CD4 + T cells were increased within the CNS of IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 relative to wild - type ( WT ) mice . Altogether , these data indicate differential regulation of SR CD4 + T cells within the CLN versus CNS during chronic JHMV infection . While Foxp3 + Tregs specifically control myelinspecific CD4 + T cells within CLN , Tr1 cells limit SR T cells within the CNS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 20}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 172}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 212}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 259}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 375}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 382}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 792}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 864}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 866, "end": 871}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1040, "end": 1046}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1048, "end": 1054}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1287}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1429, "end": 1438}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1601, "end": 1610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1795, "end": 1809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 79}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 489}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 522}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 557}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 1301, "end": 1318}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1426}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 1764, "end": 1787}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 18, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 18, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 18, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 21, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T14", "obj": 24, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
