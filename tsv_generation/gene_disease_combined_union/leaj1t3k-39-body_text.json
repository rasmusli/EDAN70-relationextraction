This is particularly true for PPMO research where much effort has been put towards developing highly active peptides to outperform the more traditionally used penetratin and tat peptides [ 61 , 62 ] . Improving CPP endosomolytical properties to intensify antiviral activity of the conjugated cargo has become a main focus , as the endosomal escape appears to be critical to antiviral activity [ 30 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 10}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
