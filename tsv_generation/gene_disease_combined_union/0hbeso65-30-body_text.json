Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies described the critical role of the association between CD81 and CLDN1 coreceptors in HCV entry [ 104 , 105 ] . Next , a rate - limiting role for SR - BI in HCV infection has been reported [ 106 ] . The in vitro study demonstrated that increased SR - BI expression would enhance entry and internalization of HCV . Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 107 , 108 ] . After internalization , fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes . Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [ 109 , 110 ] . Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations , it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
