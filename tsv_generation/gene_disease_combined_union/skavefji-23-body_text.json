{"cord_uid": "skavefji", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4019586", "divid": "23", "text": "Among the currently available inflammatory markers , serum procalcitonin is one of the best indicators of bacterial infections , including lower respiratory tract infections [ 19 ] . The usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements has been validated in the diagnosis , severity assessment , and follow - up of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] . In the current study , the AUC of serum procalcitonin concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia ( AUC = 0 . 705 ) was smaller than those of total WBC ( AUC = 0 . 855 ) and neutrophil ( AUC = 0 . 837 ) counts . The combination of BAL fluid WBC counts and serum procalcitonin concentration tended to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ROC model . This indicates that combinations of these markers can be useful to rule - out ( BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $ 0 . 71 ng / mL with a sensitivity of 95 . 8 % and negative likelihood ratio of 0 . 068 ) or rule - in ( BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL and serum C - reactive protein concentration $ 26 . 1 mg / dl with a specificity of 95 . 7 % and positive likelihood ratio of 8 . 63 ) bacterial pneumonia . Diagnostic accuracy could be further improved if BAL fluid cellular profiles are interpreted alongside clinical presentations , radiographic studies , and other relevant test results . Using this approach , it might be possible to identify patients who can be managed without antibacterial agents or those who require antiviral agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 73}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 881}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1042, "end": 1069}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 127}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 174}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 362}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 488}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1193}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 8, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 9, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 10, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
