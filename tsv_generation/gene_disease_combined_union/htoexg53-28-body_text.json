In addition to the induction of MERS - CoV - specific antibodies , the MERS - CoV N protein holds promise to efficiently activate virus - specific CD8 + T cell responses . For more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these T cell specificities in MERS - CoV - associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the N peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate MHC - restricted antigen presentation and the activation of virus - specific T cells . In this study , we identified a new H2 - d restricted CD8 + T cell epitope in the MERS - CoV N protein using a 2 - D matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15 - mer N peptides . First , we have identified two MERS - CoV N derived peptides ( N 353 - 367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK and N 357 - 371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP ) and further mapped these 15 - mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of N 358 - 367 = YKTFPKKEKK representing a decamer peptide epitope ( Figure S1 ) [ 64 ] . Analysis of MERS - CoV sequences reveals that N 358 - 367 is conserved among different strains of MERS - CoV ( Table S2 ) [ 65 ] . The availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a MVA based candidate vaccine against MERS - CoV in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models . Of note , the H2 - d restricted CD8 + T cell epitope enables characterization of T cell responses in BALB / c mice that serve as a well - established MERS - CoV infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hDPP4 [ 24 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 ] . A particular feature of MERS in humans , as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals , is the lack of detectable MERS - CoV neutralizing antibodies in patients with confirmed disease [ 66 , 67 ] . This observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response , as already described for SARS - CoV [ 68 , 69 ] . Thus , future use of a T cell - specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of MERS pathogenesis . Here , studies on the function of MERS - CoV - specific CD8 + T cells in this BALB / c mouse MERS - CoV lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in MERS - CoV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 187}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 526}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 684}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 712}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1025, "end": 1049}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1464, "end": 1503}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1682, "end": 1688}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1855, "end": 1890}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1600, "end": 1611}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1741, "end": 1746}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T9", "obj": 13, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T11", "obj": 14, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
