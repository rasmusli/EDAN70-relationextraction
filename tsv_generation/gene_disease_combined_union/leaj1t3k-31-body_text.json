The authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of antiviral siRNAs into T cells in mice : they used an antibody to the CD7 receptor as their delivery system by receptor - mediated endocytosis . They bound the siRNA to the antibody through the positively charged nona - D - arginine ( 9R ) peptide conjugated to its C - terminal via a disulfide bond . They successfully suppressed HIV - 1 infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these siRNA complexes , inhibiting HIV - 1 entry into target cells and its replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 178}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 331}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 414}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
