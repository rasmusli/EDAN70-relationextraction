{"cord_uid": "t6n95laz", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3820766", "divid": "18", "text": "VN is another protein that commonly features in studies on liver disease . It is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes that is detectable in plasma and the extracellular matrix . Glycosylation of VN modulates multimerization and collagen binding in liver regeneration ( 20 ) and alterations in VN glycosylation modulate substrate adhesion to rat hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , which is responsible for matrix restructuring ( 21 ) . Immunoblotting data identified increases in VN levels in cirrhotic livers , and VN immunoreactivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix , irrespective of the apparent reduction in plasma VN . VN immunoreactivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of fibrosis , particularly for chronic / mature fibrosis , paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa ( 22 ) . These results suggest that VN may be important in the progression of liver disease and / or in hepatic fibrosis through its collagen - binding domain I , and that VN levels are likely to be higher in patients with chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis and liver cancer than in controls ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) . In the present study , VN levels decreased in the progression of hepatitis B ( from CHB to HBV - induced ACLF ) . The observation of decreased VN levels was consistent with two other studies ( 24 , 25 ) . In one of these studies , it was demonstrated that , in chronic liver disease , the concentration of plasma VN was significantly lower than in healthy controls and was associated with the severity of liver disease . Notably , levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with chronic liver disease compared with those in normal controls . These results suggested that VN was deposited in injured tissue during the repair process and functioned as an adhesive protein ( 24 ) . In the other study , it was demonstrated that there were lower levels of plasma VN in chronic liver disease , which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis , deposition in injured tissues or a combination of the two ( 25 ) . The same group of authors also revealed that decreased levels of plasma VN and fi ( FN ) and increased levels of serum laminin ( LM ) P1 in patients with chronic liver diseases were associated with hepatic dysfunction , and that changes in the levels of the glycoproteins involved in cell attachment were significant in the development of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases ( 25 ) . Based on the accumulating information on VN and liver fibrosis , it appears that VN requires further study .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 3}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 223}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 503, "end": 506}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 688}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 942}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1369, "end": 1372}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1539, "end": 1542}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1667, "end": 1670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1828, "end": 1831}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1910, "end": 1927}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 2009, "end": 2019}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 2235, "end": 2238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 73}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 533}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 763}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 782, "end": 808}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 25, "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 995}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 26, "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1024}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 27, "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 28, "span": {"begin": 1146, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 29, "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1179}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 30, "span": {"begin": 1291, "end": 1303}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 31, "span": {"begin": 1310, "end": 1314}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 32, "span": {"begin": 1331, "end": 1336}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 33, "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1509}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 34, "span": {"begin": 1631, "end": 1645}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 35, "span": {"begin": 1736, "end": 1758}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 36, "span": {"begin": 2022, "end": 2044}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 22, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 29, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 27, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 5, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 26, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 6, "subj": "A-biobert_T12", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 7, "subj": "A-biobert_T11", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 8, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 29, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 9, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 28, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 10, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 27, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 11, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 26, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 12, "subj": "A-biobert_T10", "obj": 25, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 13, "subj": "A-biobert_T13", "obj": 32, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 14, "subj": "A-biobert_T13", "obj": 30, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 15, "subj": "A-biobert_T15", "obj": 33, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 16, "subj": "A-biobert_T16", "obj": 35, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 17, "subj": "A-biobert_T19", "obj": 36, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
