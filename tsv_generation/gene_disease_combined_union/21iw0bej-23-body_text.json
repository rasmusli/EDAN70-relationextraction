To identify the key molecules and signaling pathways that may mediate the inhibition of cell entry into S phase by EV - D68 , we examined the protein expression profiles of host G0 / G1 - phase and S - phase proteins by Western blotting of RD cells at 0 , 16 , 20 , 24 , and 28 h post - infection . Among the molecules CDK4 , CDK6 , and cyclinD ( which mediate cell cycle progression in G0 / G1 ; Massagu\u00e9 , 2004 ) and CDK2 and cyclinE1 ( which mediate cell cycle transition from G0 / G1 to S phase ; Hinds et al . , 1992 ) , the expression of CDK6 was not changed , and the expression of cyclinE1 was increased at 24 h post - infecion ( Figure 3B ) , while all of them were significantly decreased in virus - infected cells as compared to mock - infected cells at 28 h post - infection ( Figures 3B , G ) . Furthermore , the CDK2 mRNA level was decreased by EV - D68 infection ; however , there were no significant differences between the virus and mockinfected groups in CDK4 , CDK6 , cyclinD or cyclinE1 mRNA levels ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , EV - D68 infection inhibits host expression of several cell cycle proteins , which is consistent with its ability to inhibit G0 / G1 to S phase entry , and the modulation is likely to occur transcriptionally for CDK2 and post - transcriptionally for CDK4 , CDK6 , cyclinD , and cyclinE1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 304}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 411}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 511}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 636}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 676, "end": 685}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 923}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1060, "end": 1065}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1067, "end": 1072}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1082}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1346, "end": 1351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1384, "end": 1389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1391, "end": 1396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1398, "end": 1406}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1412, "end": 1421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 330}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 22, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 22, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
