Antihepatitis B immunoglobulin had been approved to successfully prevent HBV recurrence after LT . It is used in antibody therapy for HCV - infected recipients . However , recent studies using hepatitis C immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibody show only transient decrease of liver HCV RNA levels in liver transplant recipients [ 62 , 63 ] . Preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of chronic hepatitis before there is evidence of recurrent HCV infection . It is usually initiated within one month after LT . Compared to immunocompetent subjects , antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression . A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV - RNA + cirrhotic patients who started a 12 - month IFN plus RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [ 64 ] . The sustained virological response ( SVR ) was achieved in 33 % of patients . None of the patients developed graft rejection , and normal histology was also noted in patients with SVR after a median followup of 52 months . However , higher than 26 % of graft rejection was noted in another study using IFN and RBV combination therapy for more than 12 months [ 65 ] . Moreover , four other studies using different regiments , two IFN monotherapy and two pegylated - IFN monotherapy , showed a poor effect of less than 20 % of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and graft rejection [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] . Therefore , more prospective and large - scaled studies are still needed to investigate the most appropriate regimen for Preemptive treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 167}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 940}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1304, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1431, "end": 1435}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1467, "end": 1471}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 68}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 213}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 274}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 341}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 589}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 627, "end": 641}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 902}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1111, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1255, "end": 1271}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1582, "end": 1598}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
