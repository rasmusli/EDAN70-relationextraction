We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2 / EP4 - mediated kinase signaling pathways . However , the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown . We evaluated the effects of c - Jun and 3 - phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1 ) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 493}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 554}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 194}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 258}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 597}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T1", "obj": 6, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T4", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 3, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 4, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 7, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
