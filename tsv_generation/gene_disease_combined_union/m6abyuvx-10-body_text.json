Each of seven proteins - the core , E1 , E2 , NS3 - 4A , NS4B , NS5A , and NS5B - was recognized and labeled by a separate cognate antibody directed ( Figure S3 ) . To induce effective immune responses against HCV proteins in transgenic mice , we injected an rVV - HCV ( rVV - CN2 , rVV - CN5 , or rVV - N25 ) or LC16m8 ( as the control ) intradermally into CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 90 days after poly ( I : C ) injection ( Figure 2B ) . Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization with rVV - N25 revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with chronic hepatitis - including piecemeal necrosis , hepatocyte swelling , abnormal architecture of liver - cell cords , abnormal accumulation of glycogen , and steatosis ( Figures 2C - E ) . Collectively , these results demonstrated that only the rVV - N25 treatment resulted in histological changes indicative of improvement in the chronic hepatitis suffered by the transgenic mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 129}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 165}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 246}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 366}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 608}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 938, "end": 948}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 47}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 710}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 741}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 743, "end": 763}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 845}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 861}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T14", "obj": 17, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
