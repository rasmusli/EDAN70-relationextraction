It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance , and protects pigs against ETEC : F4 infection by reducing the intestinal expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF - \u03b1 and interleukin - 8 and maintaining mucosal integrity , and enhancing specific antibody defense [ 111 ] . Spray dried plasma ( SDPP ) of porcine origin has been pinpointed as a potential source for the coronavirus in a recent epidemic of porcine epidemic diarrhea ( PED ) [ 136 ] . Thus , spray - dried chicken plasma ( SDCP ) has been evaluated as a replacement for SDPP in weaned pigs . Indeed , the effect of SDCP on serum biochemistry , intestinal barrier function , immune parameters , and the expression of intestinal development - related genes in piglets was similar to SDPP [ 137 ] . Nevertheless , a study has provided evidence that PED virus is inactivated during the SDPP production process [ 138 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 322}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 338}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 890}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 602}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 608}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 985}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T3", "obj": 5, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T2", "obj": 5, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
