Indeed , the first discovery of manipulation of host processes by ADP - ribosylation emerged from the study of bacterial toxins ( e . g . , diphtheria , cholera toxins ) [ 49 ] , leaving open the possibility that bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens drove the evolution of PARP genes . However , we hypothesize that viruses may be significant or even the primary pathogens in these evolutionary arms races for several reasons . First , numerous viruses replicate poorly when ADP - ribosylation is inhibited , including viruses that replicate in the nucleus ( HSV ) [ 18 ] and cytoplasm ( vaccinia ) [ 17 ] . Second , several families of mammalian RNA viruses , including corona - and togaviruses , have nonstructural proteins that contain macrodomains . In both coronaand togaviruses , disruption of viral macrodomains has been shown to reduce virulence [ 20 , 21 ] , and in the case of coronaviruses , this reduced virulence is due to increased sensitivity to the antiviral activity of interferon ( IFN ) [ 21 ] . This suggests a simple model in which the macrodomains ( at least in coronaviruses ) are required to counteract some IFN - stimulated host gene product . Although the identity of that IFN - stimulated factor is unknown , we note that several of the rapidly evolving PARP genes we identify here , including PARP9 , PARP13 and PARP14 , are upregulated by IFN [ 50 , 51 ] . Furthermore , overexpression of PARP9 , independent of IFN , is sufficient to upregulate several known antiviral effectors [ 50 ] . Finally , overexpression of several PARP genes has been shown to inhibit replication of viruses , the most well - described example being PARP13 . Taken together , we favor a model in Tables S6 - S8 ) . ( B ) P - values derived from PAML tests of positive selection on all sequenced macro - PARP orthologs using either macrodomains alone , the entire gene minus the macrodomains or just the catalytic domain . Values in red indicate strong evidence of positive selection , while those in grey indicate a lack of statistically significant evidence for positive selection . ( C ) Phylogenetic tree of individual macrodomains from macro - PARPs , rooted using human MacroD2 as an outgroup . Macrodomains in italics lack a C - terminal extension found in most macrodomains and lack one or more of the putative catalytic motifs required for ADP - ribosylhydrolase activity [ 16 ] ( Figure S5 ) . This suggests these macrodomains may be able to recognize , but are unlikely to catalyze removal of , ADP - ribosylation . To the right is a schematic of each macrodomain with positively selected residues indicated in red ( posterior probabilities greater than 0 . 95 ) ( see also Alignment S3 ) . ( D ) Location of positively selected sites in PARP macrodomains mapped on to the structure of the first macrodomain from PARP14 in complex with ADP - ribose ( PDB code : 3Q6Z ) [ 48 ] . ADP - ribose is shown as blue sticks . Residues shown as red surfaces are those that have evolved under positive selection in the indicated macrodomain . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1004403 . g003 which PARP gene evolution has been driven primarily by genetic conflicts with viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 867}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 893}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 960}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1141, "end": 1145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1308}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1340, "end": 1364}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1422, "end": 1433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1462, "end": 1468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1470, "end": 1477}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1481, "end": 1488}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1509, "end": 1513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1559, "end": 1565}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1582, "end": 1586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1695, "end": 1706}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1797, "end": 1804}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1942, "end": 1965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1978, "end": 1991}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 2025, "end": 2038}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 2050, "end": 2067}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1028, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Disease"}], "relations": [{"id": 1, "subj": "A-biobert_T6", "obj": 23, "pred": "interactWith"}, {"id": 2, "subj": "A-biobert_T5", "obj": 23, "pred": "interactWith"}]}
