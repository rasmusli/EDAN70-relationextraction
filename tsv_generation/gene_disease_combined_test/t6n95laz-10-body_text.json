The files were subsequently submitted to an in - house Mascot server ( Matrix Science Ltd . , London , UK ) for database screening . The data were screened against the human sequence database [ National Center for Biotechnology Information non - redundant ( NCBInr ) ] . The search was performed using trypsin as a specific enzyme . A maximum of one missed cleavage was permitted and oxidation ( M ) , iTRAQ 4 plex ( K ) and iTRAQ 4 plex ( N - term ) were selected as variable modifications . The data obtained on the micrOTOF - Q were searched with a peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0 . 8 Da . Protein ratios were normalized using the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample for each separate ratio in every individual experiment . The ratio for a given protein was calculated by taking the average of all the peptide ratios that Briefly , the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies : Anti - apolipoprotein J precursor antibody ( ab16077 ; dilution , 1 : 2 , 000 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - hemoglobin \u03b2 ( sc - 21757 ; dilution , 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti - CRP precursor ( ab32412 ; dilution , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ) , anti - platelet factor 4 precursor ( AB1488P ; dilution , 1 : 5 , 000 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) and anti - VN ( ab11591 ; dilution , 1 : 500 ; Abcam ) at 4 [UNK] C overnight . After washing , the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( ECL ; Forevergen , Guangzhou , China ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
