Distribution of files is then implemented by using a demultiplexer ( Demux ) component and a result combining module ( Concat ) . More technical details about the file distribution and concatenation as well as other workflow parameters can be found elsewhere [ 23 ] . The model , design and implementation used to distribute the distance - based workflow can also be applied to parallelize the parsimony and the ML based workflows . The usage of the model and design developed for the Protdist component has therefore been used for the Protpars and the ProtML components .
