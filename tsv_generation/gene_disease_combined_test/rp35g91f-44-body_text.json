TTN regulates the passive stretch of cardiomyocytes via the I - band region of the protein which is comprised of sequential Ig , PEVK , and N2B domains ( Linke 2008 ) . In the heart , alternative splicing of Ttn results in a shorter ventricular isoform ( N2B ) and a longer atrial isoform ( N2BA ) . These two isoforms are coexpressed at different ratios during development as a mechanism for fine - tuning the passive stiffness of the cardiomyocyte . TTN acts as a signaling hub from which direct and indirect interactions with multiple proteins can lead to diverse cellular responses , including changes in gene expression ( Linke 2008 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
