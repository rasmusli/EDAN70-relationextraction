The Gn glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and SEOV possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ( ITAM ) in the cytoplasmic tail that binds to Fyn tyrosine kinase , and the ITAM may also interact with Lyn , Syk , and ZAP - 70 kinases found in lymphocytes [ 58 , 59 ] , although there is no evidence that lymphocytes are susceptible to hantaviruses . The ITAM may also promote polyubiquitination of the Gn polypeptide to facilitate its degradation [ 60 ] ; however , it is unclear how it impacts the host response to infection . Presumably , the ITAM interferes with the antiviral response of an infected cell since the motif is cytoplasmic . The Gn protein may also alter the RIG - I pathway that leads to IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent Ifn\u03b2 expression [ 61 ] . The nucleocapsid may also antagonize the expression of Ifn\u03b2 by binding to importin - \u03b1 and interfering with NF - \u03baB nuclear transport , which is required for Ifn\u03b2 expression [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] . Additionally , both caspase 3 and granzyme B are targets of the nucleocapsid of some hantaviruses [ 65 ] and both are essential components of CTL - mediated apoptosis . The lack of damage to the endothelium of infected rodent reservoirs suggests this may be an important mechanism of preventing viral clearance . The nucleocapsid of ANDV , but not other hantaviruses , also inhibits autophosphorylation and activation of TBK1 , an enzyme that activates IRF3 and NF - \u03baB and induction of type I interferon gene expression [ 66 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
