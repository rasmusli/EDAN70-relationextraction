RNA ( 5 \u03bcl ) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III ( 200 U , Invitrogen ) , RT buffer ( 1X final concentration , Invitrogen ) , and 2 \u03bcl of FPM in 20 \u03bcl reactions . An aliquot of cDNA ( 5 \u03bcl ) was amplified in 35 cycles using Phusion Highfidelity PCR kit ( New England Biolabs ) and 2 \u03bcl of PPM in a 25 \u03bcl reaction . The PCR mixture was incubated at 98 \u00b0 C for 30 s , followed by 35 cycles of 98 \u00b0 C for 10 s , 43 \u00b0 C for 30 s , and 72 \u00b0 C for 90s and a final extension of 72 \u00b0 C for 10 min . Expected PCR products for each amplicon were approximately 1500 bp . PCR products from the two reactions for each sample were pooled for Illumina library preparation . Fig . 4 Mismatches between the rRT - PCR diagnostic primers and probes and their expected binding sites in the five genomes from Kenya and Zambia . ' Fwd primer ' = Forward primer and ' Rev primer ' = Reverse primer . Two rRT - PCR assays were used for HMPV detection . The colored bars in the figure indicate nucleotide differences ( mismatches ) between ( a ) three HMPV - A genomes and HMPV - A specific primers and probes targeting fusion gene , ( b ) two HMPV - B genomes and HMPV - B specific primers and probes also targeting fusion gene , and ( c ) all five genomes reported here and specific primers and probes targeting nucleoprotein gene . The sequences of the rRT - PCR primers and probes checked against the African HMPV genomes are listed in Additional file 7 : Table S4 Illumina sequencing and data analysis Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit ( Illumina ) and pair - end sequencing ( 2 \u00d7 300 base pairs ) with the MiSeq Reagent V3 kit ( Illumina ) , following the manufacturer ' s instructions . The Nextera enzyme mix was used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and tag with universal adapters in a single tube reaction , followed by 12 - cycle PCR reaction for dual indexing . Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) were used for all purification steps and libraries were quantified and quality - checked using the Qubit ( Thermo Fisher ) and", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
