Numerous studies show that after an antigenic challenge , vaccination and natural infections , B cells transitioning to plasma cells , termed plasmablasts ( PBs ) , can be seen in the peripheral blood [ 130 , 131 ] . These can be recognized by surface markers of CD19 , downregulation of CD20 , and high levels of CD27 and CD38 [ 3 , 132 ] . In comparison to the general circulating B cell population , PBs are enriched for B cells that contain infection - specific antibodies [ 133 , 134 ] . This is variable as some studies show massive and high enrichment of PBs targeting the antigen of interest [ 135 , 136 ] , while other studies show polyspecificity of the PB population and limited enrichment [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] . Immunization studies in adults ( tetanus [ 141 ] , influenza [ 132 ] , and rabies [ 142 ] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment for specific antibodies , temporally peak 5 - 10 days after immunization , and are predictive of later sero - immunity [ 143 ] . Elevated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections , as they are elevated in a number of autoimmune diseases and their levels correlate to disease flares [ 144 ] . Although certain infections , such as dengue virus , may set off exceedingly high PB levels [ 145 ] , PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post - infection . This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying inflammatory disease , and specifically correlates with c - reactive protein ( CRP ) level in studies on ulcerative colitis [ 145 , 146 ] and IGG4 related disease [ 147 , 148 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
