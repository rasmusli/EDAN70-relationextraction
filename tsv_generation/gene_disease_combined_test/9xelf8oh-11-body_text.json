A BLASTn search ( Altschul et al . 1990 ) was used to confirm that primers and probes would not bind to non - target regions . Primers were tested with DNA from squirrels and with known positive and negative DNA templates . For SQPV , positive controls were those previously tested positive using the assay developed by Atkin et al . ( 2010 ) ; for SADV , positive controls were material that had shown a high SADV load by TEM . Reactions were initially run and optimised as uniplex reactions using Precision [UNK] SYBR \u00ae Green Master Mix ( Primer Design , Southampton , UK ) using the reaction constituents and cycle parameters described in Online Resource S1 . The optimum qPCR annealing temperature ( T a ) was determined first using a 55 - 65 \u00b0 C temperature gradient , and amplicons were assessed also for specificity using a melt curve analysis ( a single melt point was shown within the temperature predicted by the PCR design software ) . Primer concentrations were varied between 50 and 500 nM , with the primer concentration that gave the lowest crossing point ( C p ) without the appearance of additional peaks in the no - template control ( NTC ) on the melt curve considered optimum .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
