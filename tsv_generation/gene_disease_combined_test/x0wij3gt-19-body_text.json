To this end , we performed transient transcription experiments using human PDK1 promoter - reporter constructs connected to a luciferase reporter gene and found that PGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity . The induction of PDK1 promoter activity by PGE 2 was inhibited by c - Jun siRNA ( 1 . 319 \u00b1 0 . 028 vs 1 . 716 \u00b1 0 . 069 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 01 ; 1 . 171 \u00b1 0 . 071 vs 1 . 468 \u00b1 0 . 101 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 3f ) . Exogenous overexpression of c - Jun enhanced the PDK1 promoter activity ( 1 . 753 \u00b1 0 . 037 vs 1 . 401 \u00b1 0 . 075 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ; 1 . 762 \u00b1 0 . 117 vs ( Fig . 3g ) . The induction of PDK1 gene promoter activity by PGE 2 was abrogated when the one of c - Jun sites at - 4382 bp was mutated in the PDK1 gene promoter , suggesting a critical role for c - Jun in mediating the effect of PGE 2 on PDK1 gene promoter activity ( Fig . 3h ) . dmPGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity ( 2 . 432 \u00b1 0 . 358 vs 1 . 000 \u00b1 0 . 039 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ) ; point mutation of c - Jun with ac to tt at \u2212 4028 site could not derease PDK1 promoter activity ( 1 . 9832 \u00b1 0 . vs 1 . 000 \u00b1 0 . 024 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ) ; point mutation of c - Jun site with ac to tt at - 4382 bp dereased PDK1 promoter activity ( 1 . 010 \u00b1 0 . 011 vs 1 . 000 \u00b1 0 . 039 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ) ;", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
