Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) belongs to the class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive agents . Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , the active metabolite of MMF , is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . In addition to its potent immunosuppressive capacity , the in vitro assay has indicated that MPA has antiviral effect against HCV [ 45 ] . In HCV cell culture models , MPA could induce the expression of important antiviral interferon - stimulated genes , including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) 1 , IRF 9 , and interferoninduced transmembrane protein 3 ( IFITM3 ) [ 46 ] . Among these proteins , data showed that IRF1 was directly involved in the anti - HCV activity of MPA . Moreover , MPA could have effects in synergy with IFN - on HCV replication in the same HCV experiments . In addition , when combined with IFN - , MPA augmented the transcription of multiple interferon - stimulated genes . With the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with IFN , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against HCV in vivo . On the other hand , although the safety and efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressive medication in HCV patients undergoing LT have been demonstrated , the exact effects on HCV recurrence have not been clearly studied .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 248}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
