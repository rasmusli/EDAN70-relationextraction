Nevertheless , under stress conditions , the dehydrogenase is converted to an oxidase enzyme and , under these conditions , the enzyme reduces oxygen instead of NAD + . On this way , there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide . Superoxide anion can be generated by this system ( the hypoxanthine - xanthine oxidase ) or using a non - enzymatic reaction . In this case , superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen . In both cases , superoxide anion reduces nitro - blue tetrazolium ( NBT ) into formazan which is followed spectrophotometrically [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
