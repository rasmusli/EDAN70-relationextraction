The MSP - MS assay uses a 228 - member library of 14 - mer synthetic and unmodified peptide substrates that were rationally designed to maximize physicochemical diversity within a small sequence space 17 . For specificity determination , hAPN was incubated with the MSP - MS peptide library and time - dependent peptide cleavage products were identified with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) . Statistical analysis that considers both cleaved and uncleaved positions in the peptide library 18 was subsequently performed to construct an iceLogo representation of hAPN P1 - P4 \u2032 specificity as well as a corresponding heat map based on comprehensive Z - scores for each position ( Fig . 1A , B , and Supplemental Figure 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
