For Streptococcus species , although coinfection cases were higher than single infection cases , the difference did not generate a significant P value . Higher rates of bacterial coinfections by S . pneumoniae and K pneumoniae in synergy with viruses may indicate that predominant ARI viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
