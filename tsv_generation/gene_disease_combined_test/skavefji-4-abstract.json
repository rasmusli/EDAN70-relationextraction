BAL fluid median total WBC count ( 2 , 815 / mL vs . 300 / mL , P , 0 . 001 ) and percentage of neutrophils ( 80 . 5 % vs . 54 . 0 % , P = 0 . 02 ) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group . In ROC curve analysis , BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination , with an area under the curve of 0 . 855 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 750 - 0 . 960 ) . BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL had a sensitivity of 83 . 3 % , specificity of 78 . 3 % , positive likelihood ratio ( PLR ) of 3 . 83 , and negative likelihood ratio ( NLR ) of 0 . 21 . When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C - reactive protein , sensitivity was 95 . 8 % , specificity was 95 . 7 % , PLR was 8 . 63 , and NLR was 0 . 07 . BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510 / mL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13 . 5 in multiple logistic regression analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
