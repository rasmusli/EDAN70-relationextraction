HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide , and end - stage liver disease caused by HCV has increasingly become the leading indication for liver transplantation ( LT ) . It has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by HCV RNA detection using the polymerase chain reaction occurs almost universally [ 1 ] . The natural history of HCV reinfection is substantially changed after LT with accelerated rate of cirrhosis recurrence of 8 - 44 % in 5 - 7 years [ 2 ] . It has been pointed out that HCV reinfects the liver graft at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [ 3 ] . The virus source is attributed to the blood itself with a high probability [ 4 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
