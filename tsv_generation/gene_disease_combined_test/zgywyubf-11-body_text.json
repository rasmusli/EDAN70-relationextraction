Notably , the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the end of the labeling period ( 0 minute chase ) in IKK\u03b2 alone expressing cells were less than that in IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 coexpressing cells , indicating that I\u03baB\u03b1 is a very labile protein in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells . The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100 % . To further confirm whether I\u03baB\u03b1 stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF - \u03baB in ORF2 expressing cells , nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti - p65 antibody . As seen in Figure 2B , ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 2 and 4 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below ) . As expected , mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 1 and 3 ) . This is attributed to the fact that basal NF - \u03baB activity is higher in Huh7 cells [ 13 ] . In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls , equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti - calnexin and anti - phospho c - Jun antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
