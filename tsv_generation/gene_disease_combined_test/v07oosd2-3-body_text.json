Furthermore , many stress factors associated with the weaning period , such as removal from the sow , dietary changes , adapting to a new environment , mixing of pigs from different farms and histological changes in the small intestine , may negatively affect the response of immune system and lead to an intestinal gut dysfunction in pigs [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Post - weaning diarrhea is usually associated with proliferation of enterotoxigenic E . coli ( ETEC ) [ 2 , 6 ] . This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins , both essential for disease development [ 7 ] , the predominant adhesins in PWD being F4 and F18 [ 6 , 8 ] . Small intestinal adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC in pigs is mediated by F4 or F18 specific receptors , the existence and function of these receptors being crucial to determine the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infections [ 7 ] . The predominant serogroup of ETEC associated with PWD in pigs worldwide is O149 , commonly in the combination O149 : LT : STa : STb : EAST1 : F4ac [ 2 ] . Colistin , a polymyxin antibiotic produced by Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus [ 9 ] , is widely used for the control of PWD in pigs [ 10 ] . However , in humans this antibiotic is now considered as the last therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug - resistant Gram - negative bacteria ( MDR - GNB ) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species [ 11 , 12 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
