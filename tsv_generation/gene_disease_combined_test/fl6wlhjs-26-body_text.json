For a fixed value of \u03b1 , let 1 - \u03b1 denote the specificity ( the probability of no detection , when there is no actual outbreak signature ) . We declare evidence of an outbreak signature at time t if the detection process at that time point , D k , t , exceeds a threshold \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , calculated using the data or the process . Further details are given in the Appendix . Filter plots Figure 2 Filter plots . Plots of the four filters { f k , l } that can be used to calculate the detection process D k , t for the Columbus series . The number in parentheses after the filter name is \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , calculated using a normal approximation . 2 . When { a l } is the 7 - day filter , { f k , l } is a weighted average of the last 7 days ( with most weight on the current day ) , minus a weighted decaying average of the remaining past days . The weekly seasonal terms are not as strong , compared to the filter that is the convolution of the 1 - day filter .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
