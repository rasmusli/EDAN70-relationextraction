Amino acid substitutions were introduced by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Constructs were verified by sequence analysis before transiently expressed in FreeStyle 293 cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and purified by protein A affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare , United Kingdom ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 11}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
