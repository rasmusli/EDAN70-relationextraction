Expression of ORF2 protein inhibited the association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with SKP1 ( Figure 3B Since the presence of ORF2 could inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 association with full - length \u03b2TRCP but not with \u0394F - \u03b2TRCP , we postulated that the ORF2 protein either interacts with I\u03baB\u03b1 and sequesters it away from \u03b2TRCP or interacts with other subunits of the SCF complex thereby modulating \u03b2TRCP binding to I\u03baB\u03b1 . Alternatively , it binds to \u03b2TRCP itself and blocks the formation of the SCF complex . We thus checked the association of ORF2 with the above components . No interaction was detected between ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 ( Figure 3C , lane 6 ) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay . The possibility that \u03b2TRCP over - expression might be promoting ORF2 association with I\u03baB\u03b1 was ruled out by testing ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 association in full - length or \u0394F - \u03b2TRCP overexpressing cells ( Figure 3D , lane 7 and 8 ) . Lane 1 shows the level of I\u03baB\u03b1 in control cells . Subsequently , we checked whether ORF2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1 . The ORF2 protein did not associate with either SKP1 or CUL1 ( Figure 3D , lane 1 and 2 ) under conditions , where IKB\u03b1 associated with these proteins ( lane 3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
