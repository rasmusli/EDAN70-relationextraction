The ubiquitin proteasome system ( UPS ) constitutes the main non - lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that comprises three major components : the proteasome holoenzymes , a number of ubiquitin ligases and a broad variety of deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) . Ubiquitin ( Ub ) is attached to target proteins by the cascade - like catalytic action of E1 , E2 and E3 enzymes . The ubiquitin molecule is activated by an E1 ligase , followed by the transfer to one of numerous conjugating enzymes , and finally an E3 ligase catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin onto the \u03b5 - amino group of a Lysine residue within the target protein ( for review see [ 1 ] ) .
