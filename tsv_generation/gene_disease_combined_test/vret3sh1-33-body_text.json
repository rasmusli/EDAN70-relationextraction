The following example script reads as input a set of functional roles and constructs a table of subsystems that can be identified , along with their variation codes . The data displayed in this simple example could form the start of a research project to gather the functional roles not connected to subsystems to determine whether they were not connected because a small set of functional roles were not present in the input , and to seek candidates for such \" missing functional roles . \" The ability to easily map functional roles into subsystems will improve as the SEED annotation effort improves its collection of encoded subsystems [ 32 ] .
