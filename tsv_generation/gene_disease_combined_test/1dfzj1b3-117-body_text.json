The human monocyte cell line THP - 1 is often used as a model for tissue macrophages . Zhou et al . ( 2007 ) [ 149 ] showed that 1 , 8 - cineole inhibited the Egr - 1 synthesis and nuclear localization induced by LPS in THP - 1 cells but did not affect the LPS - induced NF - \u03baB expression in nuclei . Therefore , the authors concluded that 1 , 8 - cineole may preferentially block the effect of Egr - 1 by inhibiting the synthesis of Egr - 1 and preventing Egr - 1 nuclear internalization instead of NF - \u03baB inhibition [ 149 ] . Some authors reported that \u03b1 - pinene clearly inhibited the translocation of NF - \u03baB / p65 protein into nuclei in LPS - stimulated THP - 1 cells , through the increase of expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 protein [ 150 , 151 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 33}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
