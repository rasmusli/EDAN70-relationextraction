The ' ' top ' ' narrow end of the \u03b2 - propeller funnel of WDR48 interacts with the tip of the USP Fingers subdomain , whereas the WDR48 ancillary domain ( AD ) and sumo - like domain ( SLD ) curve around ubiquitin , which binds in the Palm region of the DUB . The C - terminal glycine residue and tail of ubiquitin extend towards the active site cysteine of the DUB . While Yin et al . ( 2015 ) and Dharadhar et al . ( 2016 ) crystallized their complexes in the presence of an ubiquitin - bound substrate , Li et al . ( 2016 ) crystallized USP12 in complex with WDR48 and WDR20 in the absence of bound - ubiquitin , providing additional structural insight . For example , the ' ' Pinky Finger ' ' \u03b2 - sheet of the Fingers subdomain appears disordered or displaced in apoUSP12 , whereas the four antiparallel \u03b2 - sheets of the Fingers subdomain are rigid in other USP structures ( Hu et al . , 2002 ; Avvakumov et al . , 2006 ; Ratia et al . , 2006 ; Renatus et al . , 2006 ; Yin et al . , 2015 ) . Binding of WDR48 to the tip of the Fingers subdomain stabilizes the ' ' Pinky Finger ' ' and Fingers subdomain , which may ultimately propagate to the catalytic cleft in the presence of substrate ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . WDR20 also binds the DUB via the ' ' top ' ' face of its \u03b2 - propeller but interacts with the bottom of the palm subdomain of USP12 to promote an optimal alignment of the catalytic cleft ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . Together , these structural studies suggest that binding of the WDR proteins to USP12 or USP46 relatively far from the active site results in the rearrangement of several structural elements , which propagates to the catalytic triad increasing enzyme catalysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 58}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
