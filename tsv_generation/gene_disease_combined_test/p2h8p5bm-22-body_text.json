TLR3 recruits TIR - domain - containing adapter - inducing interferon - \u03b2 ( TRIF ) [ 121 ] , TLR7 and 8 recruit myeloid differentiation primary response 88 ( Myd88 ) [ 122 ] , whereas the RIG - I - like helicases , RIG - I and MDA - 5 , recruit interferon - beta promoter stimulator - 1 ( IPS - 1 ) ( also known as mitochondrial antiviral - signaling protein ( MAVS ) , virus - induced signaling adapter ( VISA ) and CARD adapter - inducing IFN - beta ( Cardif ) ) [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] . Ligation of PRRs and downstream recruitment of the adapter molecules result in the activation of transcription factors NF - \u03baB and interferon regulatory factor ( IRF ) 3 and IRF7 , which translocate to the nucleus and induces the expression and subsequent secretion of type I IFN [ 127 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 37}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
