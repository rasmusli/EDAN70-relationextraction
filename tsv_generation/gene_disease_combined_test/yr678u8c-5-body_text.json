Both viruses have been shown to induce double membrane vesicles ( DMVs ) as well as regions of convoluted membranes [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] . Electron tomography data showed that the convoluted membranes in SARS - CoV infected cells were derived from and joined to the rough ER . In addition , the outer membranes of the DMVs were interlinked , studded with ribosomes and were also joined to the convoluted membranes and ER . Openings between the interior of the DMVs and the cytoplasm were not observed [ 7 ] . In contrast , ribosomes were not seen on the membranes of MHV induced structures [ 8 ] . Preliminary work presented here ( Figure 1 ) shows for the first time that IBV infection of mammalian Vero cells also results in the induction of DMVs . However , a detailed analysis of the membrane rearrangements triggered by IBV infection of mammalian and avian cells remains to be performed . The site of assembly of coronavirus RTCs is currently unclear . During the process of transcription and replication of the viral genome , both positive and negative sense RNAs are synthesised . As a result , dsRNA can form , possibly as a replicative intermediate . This dsRNA has been used as a marker for sites of viral RNA synthesis . However , in SARS - CoV infected cells , dsRNA was found to predominantly locate on the interior of DMVs while the majority of the nsps were found to locate on the convoluted membranes . High resolution immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a separation in the signals for nsps and dsRNA . In addition , due to the lack of any connecting channels between the interior of DMVs and the cytoplasm , questions were raised about transport of RNA to sites of virus assembly at the ERGIC [ 7 ] . Subsequent work using 5 - ethynyl uridine ( EU ) to label nascent RNA demonstrated a degree of co - localisation between EU and dsRNA signals at earlier time points of infection but this co - localisation was significantly reduced at later time points [ 10 ] . Therefore , further evidence is required to determine the precise location of coronavirus RTCs and the site of RNA synthesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
