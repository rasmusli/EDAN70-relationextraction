This observation supported phylogenetic analysis that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub - cluster but in separated sub - cluster from ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 97 . 1 ( 100 ) 99 . 4 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) 100 ( 100 ) ( 100 ) 96 ( 100 ) the viruses from the US , UK , Brazil and Tanzania . Of all viral genes , the VP1 gene was the most diverse gene among Thai CaKoVs and other reference CaKoVs . Similar observation was also reported in previous study that VP1 protein is the most variable capsid protein [ 24 ] . It is noted that the putative proline rich region at VP1 - 228 - 240 ( P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was observed both in Thai CaKoVs and reference viruses . Previous studies indicated that proline rich region may associate with enteric receptor binding of the viruses [ 14 , 24 ] . It is noted that Thai CaKoVs posed unique PPP ( VP1 ; 228 - 240 ) , which also observed most reference viruses from China , Korea , Japan , US , UK suggesting unique characteristic . These unique amino acids were not observed in the CaKoV from the Australia ( CE9 ) , Brazil ( BRA / 26 ) and Tanzania ( TZ / 75 , TZ82 ) [ 16 , 20 ] . However , the association of these unique amino acids and viral pathogenesis is still need to be further investigated . Based on genetic analysis , unique amino acids at the position , 65 V , 67D , 119L , 138 T , 150P , 151M , 153D , 201S , 204Q , 205Q , 201Q , 213 T and 241E were observed . These unique amino acids of China / Thailand sub - cluster could be benefit for the detection of virus origin or diagnostic purpose in the future . Similar to previous study , analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among CaKoVs except one variation at 776 / 777 ( VP3 / VP1 ) which unique in wild carnivores [ 16 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 603}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
