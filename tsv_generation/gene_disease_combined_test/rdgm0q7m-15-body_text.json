To study the phenomenon in vitro , a 79 - bp fragment encompassing the slippery sequence and Crich region was subcloned between the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes of a frameshift - reporter plasmid ( pDluc ) such that expression of the downstream cistron ( fluc ) was dependent upon \u2212 2 PRF within the inserted PRRSV sequences . In RRL in vitro translations , mRNAs transcribed from pDluc / PRRSV specified the synthesis of only the product of the 5 cistron of the reporter mRNA ( Rluc ) and no frameshifting was evident ( Figure 1C ) . However , supplementation with recombinant , purified His - tagged nsp1 [UNK] yielded two additional proteins , the most abundant corresponding to the product of \u2212 2 PRF . The second protein migrated more rapidly than that of Rluc and we surmised that this protein corresponded to the product of a \u2212 1 PRF , as a \u2212 1 frame stop codon is present immediately downstream of the slippery sequence ( underlined in Figure 1A ) . To confirm this , the \u2212 1 frame stop codon ( UGA ) was changed to UUA , which extends the \u2212 1 reading frame by 56 codons and simultaneously introduces a 0 - frame stop codon UAA thus shortening the Rluc gene . As expected , this point mutation increased the size of the predicted \u2212 1 PRF product , and slightly reduced the size of the Rluc protein ( stop ) . These experiments indicate that the 79 - nt region cloned into pDluc likely contains all of the cis - acting elements required for PRRSV \u2212 2 / \u2212 1 frameshifting and that supplementation of the RRL translations with nsp1 [UNK] alone is sufficient to transactivate frameshifting to levels similar to those seen in infected cells ( \u2212 2 PRF , 17 % ; \u2212 1 PRF , 7 % ; see Supplementary Table ) . The stimulation of PRF by nsp1 [UNK] was specific to the PRRSV signal in that the protein had no effect on frameshifting at a variety of well - established sites of viral \u2212 1 PRF ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Furthermore , the protein was unable to promote stop codon readthrough at variants of the PRRSV signal with an in - frame stop codon placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would be decoded in the peptidyl - ( P ) or aminoacyl - ( A ) site of the ribosome ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
