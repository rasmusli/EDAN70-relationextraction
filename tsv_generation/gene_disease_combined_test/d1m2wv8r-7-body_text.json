Currently , the clinical application of several chemotherapeutic agents is limited because of their severe toxic effects to healthy cells . Anti - cancer therapy using a virus that can selectively target cancer cells has become a popular approach . CPV is a virus that can be potentially used to treat cancer 13 . A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 can lead to regression of skin tumours in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14 .
