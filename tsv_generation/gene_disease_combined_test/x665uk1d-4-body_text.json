In 1994 , scFv which binds to the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) regulatory protein Rev was expressed intracellularly and potently inhibited HIV - 1 replication in scFv immunized cells [ 15 ] . In addition , scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [ 16 , 17 ] . The retroviral capsid protein can be used as an antiviral target and thereby extend the number of targets that can potentially be used in combined scFvbased gene therapy approaches [ 18 ] . However , despite the many virus resistant studies using scFv proteins , no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses . Montandon et al . ( 1982 ) showed antiviral effects against Moloney murine leukemia virus ( M - MuLV ) with DNase I . In another study , DNase I digested DNA in the form of unmethylated proviral M - MuLV selectively [ 19 ] . Exonuclease , ISG20 , which is induced by type 1 interferon ( IFN ) , was over - expressed in CEL cells to inhibit HIV replication through nuclease activity [ 20 , 21 ] . Another case was reported in a plant system using Pac1 , an RNase isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Challenging a transgenic potato that expresses Pac1 with potato spindle tuber viroid ( PSTVd ) resulted in suppression of PSTVd infection and accumulation without significant undesired effects on the plant . The anti - viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNAhydrolyzing activity [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 2, "end": 7}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
