Reactions were incubated at 18 \u2022 C for 5 min prior to addition of edeine to 5 M . Aliquots ( 1 . 5 l ) were subsequently withdrawn at intervals post - edeine addition , mixed with an equal volume of 10mM EDTA , 100 g / ml RNase A and placed on ice . At the end of the time - course , samples were analysed by SDS - PAGE .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 75}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
