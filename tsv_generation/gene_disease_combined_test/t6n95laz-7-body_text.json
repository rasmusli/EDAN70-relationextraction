Protein solutions [ 100 \u00b5g ; 5 mg / ml in 0 . 5 M triethyl ammonium bicarbonate ( TEAB ) containing 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , pH 8 . 5 ] were digested for 24 h with 10 \u00b5g L - 1 - ( 4 - tosylamido ) - 2 - phenylethyl tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) - treated trypsin . Each peptide solution was labeled for 3 h at room temperature using an iTRAQ reagent that had been reconstituted in 70 liters of ethanol , in accordance with the iTRAQ Reagents Multiplex kit instructions ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . The reaction was terminated by adding MilliQ water , and the samples were labeled with 114 , 115 , 116 and 117 mass - tagged iTRAQ reagents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 401, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
