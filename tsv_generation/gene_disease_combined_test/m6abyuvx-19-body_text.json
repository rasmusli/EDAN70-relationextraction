The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines increased in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice ( Figure 6A , Figure S5 ) . Immunization with rVV - N25 affected serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice and caused a return to the cytokine levels observed in wild - type untreated mice ( Figure 6A ) . In wild - type mice , the cytokine levels remained unchanged after immunization ( Figure 6A ) . These results indicated that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
