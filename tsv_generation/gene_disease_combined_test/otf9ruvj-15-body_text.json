In patients at risk , PCR for atypical pathogens was also performed in BAL samples . Infection was defined as > 10 6 colony - forming units ( CFU ) in BAL and / or urinary cultures . For blood cultures , any replicate of bacterial growth was defined as infection . During flu season , influenza infection was detected by PCR . BAL samples were also analyzed for other viral pathogens , such as cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) . Positive findings for these viruses were confirmed by cell cultures . Patients with unknown pathogens and immune suppression were additionally screened for other pathogens .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
