This conversion is directed by precompiled or user - defined templates that exploit wealth of annotation available in cognate entries of external databases . Using examples , we demonstrate how this tool can be used to generate names for practical purposes , particularly in virology .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
