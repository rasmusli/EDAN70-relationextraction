Firstly , the cells were collected and fixed with 1 ml of cold 70 % ethanol at 4 \u2022 C overnight and then re - suspended in PI staining buffer ( 50 \u00b5g / ml PI ( Sigma ) , 20 \u00b5g / ml RNase in PBS ) for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACScan ; BD ) were used to analyze the PI - stained cells , and at least 10 , 000 cells were counted for each sample . ModFit LT , version 2 . 0 ( Verity Software House ) was performed for data analysis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
