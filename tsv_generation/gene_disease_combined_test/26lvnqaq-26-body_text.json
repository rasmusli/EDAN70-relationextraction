Then , swabs were aseptically removed from the tissues and immediately put into an Amies transport medium for bacteria isolation ( Copan Innovation , Brescia , Italy ) , thus these biological specimens were sent to the laboratory for standard microbiology examinations . Swabs were promptly inoculated into solid and liquid media for bacteria isolation such as Blood Agar plates , Mac Conckey plates , BEA plates ( Bile Esculin Agar ) and heart infusion broth ( HIB ) and cultivated at 37 \u00b0 C under 5 % CO 2 environment for 24 h . After incubation , plates were checked for visible bacteria growth and in case of presence of colonies further standard bacteriological analyses were carried out for bacterial identification . On the contrary , if no colonies were present on agar surface and the HIB broth presented turbidity , some drops of the broth cultures were inoculated in new and sterile Blood Agar , Mac Conckey and BEA plates , which were incubated in the same physical conditions for further 24 h . Swabs for Mycoplasma spp . detection were submitted for DNA extraction by MagVetTM Universal isolation kit ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and Microlab STARlet ( Hamilton Robotics , Reno , NV , USA ) ; M . synoviae was investigated through a Real Time PCR targeting the 16S - 23S gene as described by Raviv and Kleven [ 28 ] with slight modifications . The end - point PCR for M . gallisepticum , targeting the MGC2 gene , was performed as described by Garcia et al . [ 29 ] with slight modifications .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1546}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
