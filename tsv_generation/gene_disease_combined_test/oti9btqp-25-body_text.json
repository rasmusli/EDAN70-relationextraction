Both strains of mice responded with a robust humoral immune response when immunised with ZIKV - prME . T - cell responses were also induced , but appear to be more robust in wild - type C57BL / 6 compared with those induced in the IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 animals , supporting a partial defect in innate to adaptive immunity transition as expected owing to the knock - out phenotype in the mouse . However , based on the induction of antigen specific immunity , the model was useful for evaluation of the impact of the vaccine on both infection and pathogenesis . A single vaccination with ZIKV - prME in IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice was protective against disease and death in this model , including protection of neuro - pathogenesis . Flavivirus - neutralising antibodies directed against the Env antigen are thought to have a key role in protection against disease , an idea supported directly by passive antibody transfer experiments in animal models and indirectly by epidemiological data from prospective studies in geographical areas that are prone to mosquito - borne viral infections . 3 , 7 , 8 Although immunisation of IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice with the ZIKV - prME DNA vaccine as well as serum transfer from immunised NHPs were protective in this murine model , the IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 vaccinated as opposed to serum - transferred mice exhibited greater control of weight loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis . Although additional studies are needed , this result potentially suggests a role for the T - cell response in this aspect of protection in this model . In addition , we observed that control IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 mice who recovered from challenge remain viral positive by PCR for at least several weeks , suggesting an additional benefit of vaccination in limiting potential sexual or vector borne transmission . Our study extends prior findings and supports the potential of vaccination and , in this case this synthetic DNA vaccination , to impact prevention of disease in a susceptible host . were maintained in DMEM ( Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ; Gibco - Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin and passaged upon confluence . Both ZIKV virus strains MR766 ( a kind gift from Dr Susan Weiss ) and PR209 ( Bioqual , MD ) were amplified in Vero cells and stocks were titred by standard plaque assay on Vero cells . Five - to six - week - old female C57BL / 6 ( The Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) and IFNAR \u2212 / \u2212 ( MMRRC repository - The Jackson Laboratory ) mice were housed and treated / vaccinated in a temperature - controlled , light - cycled facility in accordance with the National Institutes of Health , Wistar and the Public Health Agency of Canada IACUC ( Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ) guidelines .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 899, "end": 936}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
