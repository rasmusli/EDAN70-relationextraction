WDRs consist of 40 - 60 amino acids ending in a tryptophan - aspartic acid ( WD ) motif . The WDR form a funnel - shaped , \u03b2 - propeller structure made up of 6 - 8 blades , with each blade consisting of four anti - parallel \u03b2 - sheets that are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds . This rigid \u03b2 - propeller structure provides multiple stable surfaces for protein interactions ( Pashkova et al . , 2010 ; Stirnimann et al . , 2010 ; Villamil et al . , 2013 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 13}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
