PPARs are able to attenuate NF - \u03baB function either by interfering with the transcription activating capacity of the NF - \u03baB complex or by regulating genes that suppress the activation of NF - \u03baB . By physical interaction with components of the NF - \u03baB complex , PPAR\u03b1 impairs binding of NF - \u03baB to the DNA and subsequent activation of inflammatory genes . Secondly , PPAR\u03b1 activation results in increased expression of I\u03baB , the inhibitory protein that prevents the transfer of NF - \u03baB to the nucleus [ 134 , 135 ] . On the other hand , Inoue et al . ( 2000 ) [ 136 ] consider that COX - 2 expression is regulated by a negative feedback loop , mediated through PPAR\u03b3 , especially in macrophages , indicating that PPAR\u03b3 participates in cell type - specific control of COX - 2 expression .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
