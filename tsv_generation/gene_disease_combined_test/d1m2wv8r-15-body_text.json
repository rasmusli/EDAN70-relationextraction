Both cluster A ( Fig . 4b ) and cluster B ( Fig . 4c ) are highlighted . Sixty - nine proteins in cluster A were up - regulated during the whole infection period , especially at 48 hpi and 60 hpi . The DAVID analysis indicated that the proteins in cluster A were mainly associated with cellular apoptosis , including HMOX1 , TOP2A , HSPA9 , HSPD1 , F2 , HBB , SLC25A24 , BAK1 , VDAC2 , PHB , APOH , and VIMP . Moreover , five of these proteins were classified as negative regulators of apoptosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 178}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
