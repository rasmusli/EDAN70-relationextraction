This genomic RNA is recognised directly by the host cell translation machinery and two large polyproteins , pp1a and pp1ab , of approximately 400 and 800 kDa are translated . The two polyproteins encode the 15 ( IBV ) or 16 ( all other coronaviruses ) non - structural proteins ( nsps ) , which are generated by co - or post - translational cleavage by virally encoded proteases . These proteins assemble into viral replication - transcription complexes ( RTCs ) , providing the virus with the enzymes required for viral RNA transcription and replication , as well as proof - reading and capping of new viral transcripts [ 1 ] . In addition , expression of the nsps triggers the rearrangement of host cell membranes , presumed to provide a platform for the assembly of RTCs . It is likely that expression of the membrane associated nsps 3 , 4 and 6 is responsible for inducing these rearrangements . Data from closely related arterivirus , equine arterivirus ( EAV ) , demonstrated that expression of nsps 2 and 3 ( homologues of nsps 3 and 4 in coronaviruses ) , in the absence of other viral proteins , was sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements and mutation of nsp3 blocked this function [ 2 , 3 ] . Non - structural protein 4 from MHV is known to play a role in formation of rearranged membranes because viruses containing mutant nsp4s show defects in membrane rearrangements and a reduction in virus replication [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , co - expression of nsp4 with the C - terminus of nsp3 from MHV resulted in the relocation of both proteins from diffuse in the cytoplasm to punctate [ 6 ] . The authors hypothesised that interaction between these proteins may result in the rearrangement of host membranes [ 6 ] . However , the precise mechanism by which the nsps induce membrane rearrangements remains to be elucidated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
