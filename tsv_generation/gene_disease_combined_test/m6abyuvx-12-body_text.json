We found that within 28 days after immunization the HCV core protein levels were significantly lower in livers of rVV - N25 - treated mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3A ) . Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that , within 28 days after immunization , levels of HCV core protein were substantially lower in the livers of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , neither resolution of chronic hepatitis nor reduction in the HCV protein levels was observed in the mice treated with LC16m8 , rVV - CN2 , or rVV - CN5 . These results indicated that HCV nonstructural proteins might be important for effects of therapeutic vaccines . In contrast , rVV - CN5 which encoded HCV structural and non - structural proteins did not show any significant effects . These results indicated that HCV structural proteins might have inhibited the therapeutic effects of the non - structural proteins . Therefore , it may be important to exclude the HCV structural proteins ( aa 1 - 541 ) as antigenic proteins when developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic hepatitis C .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 190}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
