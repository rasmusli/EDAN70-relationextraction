In human hepatoma cells , ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F - box protein \u03b2TRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF \u03b2TRCP ubiquitination complex , resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein . This , in turn , led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the p65 protein , which is the major subunit of the NF - \u03baB trans - activation complex . Analysis of two NF - \u03baB target genes further confirmed the above observation . The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
