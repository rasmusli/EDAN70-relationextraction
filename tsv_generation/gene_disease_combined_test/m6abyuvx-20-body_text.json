We observed the development of chronic hepatitis in the nontransgenic mice within 7 days after the serum transfer ( Figures 6B and C ) . This finding was consistent with the 28 days after immunization with LC16m8 or rVV - N25 . The scale bars indicate 100 mm ( C ) and 50 mm ( D ) .

Furthermore , to investigate whether TNF - a and IL - 6 played particularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis in the transgenic mice , we neutralized TNF - a and blocked the IL - 6 receptor in the livers of these mice . As expected , chronic hepatitis did not develop in these mice . ( Figure 6D and E ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
