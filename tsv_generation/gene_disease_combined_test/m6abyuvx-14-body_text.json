To investigate this hypothesis , we conducted an RTD - PCR analysis of genomic DNA from liver samples of CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice . The recombined transgene was similar in rVV - N25 - treated and control mice 28 days after immunization ( Figure 3D ) . We also measured the expression of HCV mRNA in LC16m8 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice with that in rVV - N25 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice 28 days after immunization ; the HCV mRNA levels did not differ between rVV - N25 - treated CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) and control mice ( Figure 3E ) . These results indicated that rVV - N25 - induced suppression of HCV core protein expression could be controlled at a posttranscriptional level .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 69}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
