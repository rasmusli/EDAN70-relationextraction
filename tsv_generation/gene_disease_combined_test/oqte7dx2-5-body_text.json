AMPARs are assembled as hetero - tetramers comprised of various combinations of the pore - forming subunits GluA1 - A4 . Subunit composition and association with auxiliary subunits determine the biophysical and trafficking properties of the channel ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ) . AMPARs can be regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications , such as ubiquitination , which controls receptor trafficking and degradation ( Goo et al . , 2015 ) . Studies of the AMPAR GLR - 1 , which shares 40 % - 50 % identity with rat GluA1 and GluA2 ( Hart et al . , 1995 ; Brockie et al . , 2001 ) , in C . elegans were the first to show that glutamate receptors ( GluRs ) are regulated by ubiquitin ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . Ubiquitin is directly conjugated to the cytoplasmic tail of GLR - 1 , providing a signal for clathrinmediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ) . Later studies showed that all four mammalian AMPAR subunits , GluA1 - A4 , are also regulated by ubiquitin ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ; Fu et al . , 2011 ; Lin et al . , 2011 ; Lussier et al . , 2011 ; Widagdo et al . , 2015 ) . Although several studies suggest that AMPARs are likely ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane prior to internalization ( Burbea et al . , 2002 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 ; Lin et al . , 2011 ) , other studies propose that AMPARs are ubiquitinated at endosomes ( Lussier et al . , 2011 ; Widagdo et al . , 2015 ) , prior to degradation in the lysosome . Future research will be necessary to determine if stimulus type , intensity or duration determine the subcellular site of ubiquitination .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
