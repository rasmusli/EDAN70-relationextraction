[ 25 ] showed that in cultured cells of black flying foxes , interferon - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) were expressed at higher levels than their human counterparts . They also demonstrated that an antiviral effector 2 - 5A - dependent endoribonuclease ( RNase - L ) is a unique downstream ISG gene , which is stimulated directly by interferon in bat cells [ 25 ] . The activated RNase - L can then cleave viral mRNA . In contrast , in human cells , RNase - L is not directly stimulated by interferon but via an intermediate molecule , 2 , 5 - oligoadenylate ( 2 - 5A ) synthetase [ 26 ] . Similarly , direct activation of RNase - L was also observed in in vivo experiments with Jamaican fruit bats ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) [ 27 ] . Inactivation of the RNase - L gene renders bat cells more susceptible to virus infection and direct induction of RNase - L may provide bats with an additional layer of antiviral defense [ 25 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
