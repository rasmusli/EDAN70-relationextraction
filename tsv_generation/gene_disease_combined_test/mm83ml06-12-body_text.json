For intracellular Gag staining , cells were permeabilized using Cytofix / Cytoperm ( BD Bioscience , San Jose , CA , USA ) . Gag was detected by staining with a FITC - labeled anti - CA mAb ( KC57 ; Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA , USA ) diluted 1 : 100 in Perm / Wash buffer ( BD Bioscience ) . For detection of total H2 - K b molecules , cells were incubated with hybridoma cell culture supernatant containing the mAb B8 - 24 - 3 [ 57 ] , followed by staining with secondary Alexa 647 - conjugated anti - mouse Ab ( Invitrogen , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software ( BD Bioscience ) . Data were analyzed by using the FACS Express V3 software ( De Novo Software ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
