Cells were treated with inhibitor or antagonist for 2 h before exposure of the cells to PGE 2 in the culture medium ( containing 10 % FBS ) . In separate experiments , cells were transfected with control , PDK1 , EP4 or c - Jun siRNAs or expression vector for 40 h before exposure to PGE 2 for up to 4 days . Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter - Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay , a homogenous method of determining number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present which signals the presence of metabolically active cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
