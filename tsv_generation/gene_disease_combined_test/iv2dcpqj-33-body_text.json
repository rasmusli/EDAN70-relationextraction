HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the recombinant plasmid pFUGW - eEF1A or the empty vector pFUGW , and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 ( Addgene ) and pMD2 . G ( Addgene ) . At 6 hpt , the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5 % FBS . After 48 - h incubation , the supernatant of the cell culture was harvested and ultra - centrifuged to concentrate the recombinant lentiviruses . Subsequently , PK - 15 cells grown on 6 - well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses of 10 transduction units ( TU ) per cell . The expression of EGFP - eEF1A in the transduced PK - 15 cells was examined by Western blotting using a rabbit anti - eEF1A MAb ( 1 : 2000 ) ( catalog no . ab157455 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
