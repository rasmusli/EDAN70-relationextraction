Although self - limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate ~ 1 - 2 % , a high 10 - 20 % mortality rate is observed during pregnancy [ 6 ] . Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host . A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF - \u03baB activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients [ 9 ] . Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the ability to inhibit NF - \u03baB activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 459}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
