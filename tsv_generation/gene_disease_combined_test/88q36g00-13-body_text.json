Following the discovery , in the 1980s , of the increased risk of schizophrenia after maternal influenza infection 37 , models of viral - like immune activation by polyriboinosinic - polyribocytidilic acid ( poly ( I : C ) ) have been widely studied 33 , 38 , 39 . In addition , models of bacterial - like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and behavioral abnormalities in offspring , similar to the poly ( I : C ) models 38 . However , with respect to neurotoxicity , LPS exposure may have a stronger effect on the fetal brain than poly ( I : C ) exposure 29 . Thus , the type of pathogen is important for the pattern of neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the offspring , and the timing and dose of the pathogen ' s administration , in addition to the strain or species , may also have an influence . The present model of prenatal exposure to LPS led to impairments in short - term memory and social interaction at 3 to 4 weeks after birth .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 431}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
