Following incubation with nsp1 [UNK] ( 6 g ) for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C on a rotating wheel , the protein was removed and the beads washed three times with GST wash buffer . Test protein ( 2 g ) was added to the beads and the incubation and washing steps repeated , with the GST wash buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 % NP - 40 . After removal of the final wash , 25 l 4 \u00d7 Laemmli ' s sample buffer was added , the beads boiled for 5 min and supernatants analysed by SDS - PAGE .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
