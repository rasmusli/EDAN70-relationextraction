Briefly , the upper and lower sequences of shRNAs for eEF1A and non - targeting negative control ( NC ) are listed in Table 1 . The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the lentivirus vector pLVX - shRNA2 ( Clontech ) . The resulting recombinant plasmids pLVX - eEF1A - shRNA1 , pLVX - eEF1A - shRNA2 or pLVX - NC - shRNA were cotransfected with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2 . G into HEK293T cells in 10 - cm cell dishes . At 48 hpt , the lentiviruses in the culture supernatant were concentrated at [UNK] for 20 min at 4 [UNK] C using an Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel - 100 membrane ( catalog no . UFC910096 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . The lentiviuses were titrated and transduced into PK - 15 cells as described above . Knockdown of eEF1A was validated by Western blotting using the anti - eEF1A MAb ( 1 : 2000 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 38}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
