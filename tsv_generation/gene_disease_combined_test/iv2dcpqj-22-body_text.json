The possible mechanism of the negative effect of eEF1A on the CSFV growth is that eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity . Further studies are needed to define the detailed interplay among eEF1A , NS5A and IRES in the life cycle of CSFV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 40}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
