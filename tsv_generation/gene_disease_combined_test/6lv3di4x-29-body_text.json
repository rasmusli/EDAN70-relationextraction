RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II filtered columns ( Macherey - Nagel ) . cDNA was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription ( RT ) kit ( Qiagen ) using random hexamers ( Thermo Fisher ) . RT - quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . The primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1 . Fold change of gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle ( 2 [UNK] ) method ( 69 ) , and the 18S housekeeping gene was used for normalization . Relative gene expression results are presented on a base 2 logarithmic scale .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 118}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
