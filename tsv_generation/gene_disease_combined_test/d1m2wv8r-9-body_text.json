The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 and analysed between 0 and 60 h post - infection ( hpi ) . As shown in Fig . 1a , the mock - infected cells maintained growth without obvious CPEs . In contrast , CPEs in the infection groups became noticeable at 36 hpi and progressed thereafter , and more than half of the cells had become detached at 60 hpi . As shown in Fig . 1b , the viral titre reached a plateau between 24 hpi and 60 hpi , and then rapidly declined . Using the dynamic changes in CPEs and viral titre as a guide , time points between 12 hpi and 60 hpi were selected for comprehensive proteomic analysis during which the viral titre remained high while the CPEs progressed in the infected cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
