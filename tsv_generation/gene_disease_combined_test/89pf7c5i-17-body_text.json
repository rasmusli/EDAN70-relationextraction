It has been considered for a long time that cats did not play any role in the epidemiology of L . infantum in endemic areas . This view was directed by the facts that , for a long period , very few cases of clinical leishmaniosis were described in cats as compared to dogs , and that Italy ( Imperia , Liguria ) PCR - RFLP [ 26 ] Italy ( Messina , Sicily ) MLEE [ 10 ] Italy ( Lipari island , Sicily ) MLEE and PCR - RFLP [ 11 ] Switzerland a PCR and sequencing [ 50 ] France ( Alpes - Maritimes ) MLEE [ 12 ] Spain ( Barcelona ) PCR and sequencing [ 29 ] Spain ( Madrid community ) PCR and sequencing [ 33 , 78 ] Spain a ILMA [ 68 ] Spain ( Mallorca ) b PCR - RFLP [ 95 ] Portugal ( Lisbon region ) PCR and sequencing [ 96 , 97 ] Portugal ( Lisbon and Algarve regions ) PCR and sequencing [ 98 ] Greece ( Thessaly and Macedonia ) PCR and sequencing [ 99 ] Brazil ( Cotia , S\u00e3o Paulo state ) PCR and sequencing [ 100 ] Brazil ( Rio de Janeiro ) PCR and hybridization [ 101 ] Brazil [ 23 ] cats have also been considered more resistant to experimental infection [ 39 ] . This interpretation has changed , as the concepts of reservoir and susceptibility in infected hosts are now better understood . The majority of infected dogs does not exhibit clinical signs ( at least for a long period ) , although they can be infectious to sand flies and consequently serve as sources of infection . During the last two decades , many wild mammals have been diagnosed with Leishmania infection by serological and / or molecular methods [ 40 ] . However , their role as reliable sources of infection ( infectiousness to sand flies , persistent infection ) remains unknown [ 40 ] . The recent demonstration that hares can be persistently infected , infectious to sandflies and a reservoir for humans in the absence of participation of dogs in the transmission cycle opens a possible evaluation of the role of species other than dogs in the epidemiology of L . infantum infections in particular scenarios [ 41 , 42 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
