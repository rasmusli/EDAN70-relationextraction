Neutralization of IFNa in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro . Since the primary source of virus - induced IFNa in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ' s ) , we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation . Depletion of pDC ' s in vivo eradicated both the LDV - induced IFNa response and lymphocyte activation . A primary receptor in pDC ' s for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll - like receptor 7 ( TLR7 ) pattern recognition receptor . Infection of TLR7 - knockout mice revealed that both the IFNa response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo . Interestingly , virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC - depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFNa response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 76}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
