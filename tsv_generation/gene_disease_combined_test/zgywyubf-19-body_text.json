No other function of ORF2 protein has yet been reported . In this article , we present evidence which suggest that the ORF2 protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle . The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments . First , ORF2 was capable of directly interacting with the F - box protein \u03b2TRCP , both in vitro and in vivo . Second , \u039435 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , was also capable of inhibiting NF - \u03baB activity , thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact . Third , ORF3 protein of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
