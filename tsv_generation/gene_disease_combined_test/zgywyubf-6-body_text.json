{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "6", "text": "Hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known open reading frames ( ORFs ) [ 6 ] . ORF1 codes for non structural proteins , essential for viral replication ; ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV , called ORF2 protein ; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host - cell processes during viral infection , and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus [ 7 , 8 ] . Although HEV infection is generally self - limiting , it induces fulminant hepatic failure , which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women . A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF - \u03baB activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients [ 9 ] . However , the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 105}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
