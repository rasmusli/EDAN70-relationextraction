LRP2 ( low density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 2 ) is a critical component of the sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) signaling pathway ( Christ et al . 2012 ) . There is some evidence that LRP2 can shed its intracellular domain , which then shuttles to the nucleus where it may interact with as - yet - unidentified transcription factors ( Li et al . 2008 ) . However , a role for LRP2 has not yet been identified in either heart or lung . The Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb region contained six genes , only two of which were expressed in adult lung ( Ttn and Ccdc141 ; Table 3 ) . Of these , titin ( Ttn ) was a likely candidate modifier based on its role as a key integrator of myocyte signaling pathways ( Linke 2008 ; Miller et al . 2004 ) . Therefore , Rab23 , Zfp451 , Nostrin , Lrp2 , and Ttn were analyzed further .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 53}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
