Analysis of a total of 15 primate PARP4 exon 30 sequences confirmed our initial screening results that this region has evolved under positive selection ( PAML p - value , 0 . 0001 , PARRIS p - value , 0 . 01 ) ( Figure S2A and Alignment S1 ) . These analyses also identified several codons within exon 30 that display dramatic signatures of recurrent positive selection ( Table S4 ) . For instance , despite being in close proximity in the primary sequence to codons that are strictly conserved across primates , codon 1517 has undergone at least six amino acid changes during approximately 45 million years of simian primate evolution , with a calculated dN / dS ratio . 3 ( Figure 2C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 59}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
