The ability of MERS - CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis . Many MERS - CoV - encoded proteins were identified to have interferon ( IFN ) - antagonizing properties , which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models . In this study , we fully characterized the IFN - antagonizing property of the MERS - CoV M protein . Expression of MERS - CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly ( I : C ) induction . This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 ( IRF3 ) but not nuclear factor - \u03baB . MERS - CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3 - TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation . M proteins from MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV have three highly similar conserved N - terminal transmembrane domains and a C - terminal region . Using chimeric and truncation mutants , the N - terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS - CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression , whereas the C - terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression . Collectively , our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1 - dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 326}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
