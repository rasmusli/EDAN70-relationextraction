Our hypothesis was based on the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs , it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia indicating local virus replication ( 9 ) . While JEV is also found in tonsils ( 8 , 9 , 12 ) , immune animals ' tonsils were found to be protected from infection , indicating that this organ is infected only following viremia ( 9 ) and would therefore not represent the point of JEV entry . On the other hand , a recent study demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasal epithelium as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelium ( 11 ) . We therefore investigated whether the nasal epithelium can be infected from the apical surface and whether this infection would cause both apical and basolateral virus shedding . This would indeed represent a prerequisite for the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract to play a role in direct transmission of JEV . The present work included ex vivo and in vitro experimental models as porcine nasal explants and well - differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells ( NEC ) cultured at the air - liquid interface ( ALI ) . In fact , our data demonstrate that JEV has the ability of infecting apically , resulting in both apical and basolateral virus shedding in swine nasal epithelial cells and indicating that the porcine nasal mucosa could represent a gateway for JEV entry and exit in pigs . Furthermore , we demonstrate that epithelial cells release soluble factors favoring subsequent infections of macrophages known to be present in the lamina propria of the mucosa .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 697, "end": 707}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
