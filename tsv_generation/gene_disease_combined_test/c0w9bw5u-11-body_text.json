To address this issue , two different luciferase reporter constructs , in which tandem copies of either IRF3 - or NF - \u03baB - binding elements were inserted into their promoter region , were used . The truncation mutant of RIG - I known as RIG - I N that contains only the N - terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways . 28 The MERS - CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3 - driven luciferase construct in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 2A ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) , but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF - \u03baB - driven construct ( Figure 2B ; bars 3 - 5 compared with bar 2 ) although the canonical inhibitor I\u03baB - \u03b1 could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2 ) . Hence , the suppressive effect of the MERS - CoV M protein is specific for IRF3 signaling but not NF - \u03baB activation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
