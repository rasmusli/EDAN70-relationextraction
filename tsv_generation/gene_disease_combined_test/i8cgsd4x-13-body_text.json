Real - time RT - qPCR showed increased WNV NS1 levels ( > 4 - fold ) in cells transfected with CxCul4 compared with empty vector ( Control ) , indicating increased viral replication ( Fig 3E ) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media also showed significantly increased viral titer ( > 10 - fold ) in cells over - expressing CxCul4 compared with control cells ( Fig 3F ) . In a parallel experiment , western blots using V5 antibody was performed on total cell lysates collected from Hsu cells transfected with CxCul4 to confirm exogenous expression level of CxCul4 ( Fig 3G ) . Combined , the above data suggest that CxCul4 plays a significant pro - viral role during WNV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
