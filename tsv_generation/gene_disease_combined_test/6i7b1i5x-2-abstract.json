Epidemiology supports a relationship of KD to an infectious disease . Several pathological mechanisms are being considered , including a superantigen response , direct invasion by an infectious etiology or an autoimmune phenomenon . Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin is effective at reducing the rates of coronary aneurysms . However , the role of B cells and antibodies in KD pathogenesis remains unclear . Murine models are not clear on the role for B cells and antibodies in pathogenesis . Studies on rare aneurysm specimens reveal plasma cell infiltrates . Antibodies generated from these aneurysmal plasma cell infiltrates showed cross - reaction to intracellular inclusions in the bronchial epithelium of a number of pathologic specimens from children with KD . These antibodies have not defined an etiology . Notably , a number of autoantibody responses have been reported in children with KD . Recent studies show acute B cell responses are similar in children with KD compared to children with infections , lending further support of an infectious disease cause of KD . Here , we will review and discuss the inconsistencies in the literature in relation to B cell responses , specific antibodies , and a potential role for humoral immunity in KD pathogenesis or diagnosis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
