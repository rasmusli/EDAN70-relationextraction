The values of the effective number of codon ( ENC ) range from 20 to 61 . In an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid , this value would be 20 ; if all codons are used equally , it would be 61 ; and if the value of ENC is greater than 40 , the codon usage bias was regarded as low . The values of ENC were obtained by EMBOSS CHIPS program [ 20 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
