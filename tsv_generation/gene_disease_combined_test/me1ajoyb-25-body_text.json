Activation of TLR / RIG - I pathways leads to the expression of several miRNAs [ 98 ] that likely are important in lymphocyte functions [ 99 ] . Because hantavirus Gn targets RIG - I [ 61 ] , it is possible that these miRNAs are dysregulated , which could provide the virus an advantage over the host cell response . While miRNA expression has been evaluated in hantavirus - infected human endothelial cells , epithelial cells and macrophages [ 100 , 101 ] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of miRNAs in reservoir host cells infected with hantaviruses . Considering the importance of miRNA in host responses , it is likely they play an instrumental role in the immunological events leading to persistent infection of the reservoir hosts . The use of RNA - Seq can identify global miRNA expression [ 102 ] and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 28}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
