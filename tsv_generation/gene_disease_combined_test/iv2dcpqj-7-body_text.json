For TBSV , eEF1A facilitates the assembly of the TBSV replicase and stimulates minus - strand synthesis [ 21 ] . The HIV - 1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress - induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages through the nuclear - cytoplasmic transport of eEF1A and tRNAs . Moreover , eEF1 complex subunits are critical HIV - 1 reverse transcription cofactors [ 22 , 23 ] . In addition , the BVDV NS5A was also shown to interact with eEF1A [ 24 ] . Considering CSFV , BVDV , HCV and WNV are all Flaviviridae members , we suppose that the CSFV NS5A protein possibly interacts with eEF1A or affects the CSFV growth in host cells . In this study , we identified the host protein eEF1A as a novel NS5A - interacting partner that negatively regulates the growth of CSFV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
