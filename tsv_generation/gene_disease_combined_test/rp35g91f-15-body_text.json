The top 100 transcripts correlated with Acta2 were enriched for smooth muscle - associated genes [ including gamma - actin 2 ( Actg2 ) , leiomodin ( Lmod2 ) , transgelin ( Tagln ) , and calponin 1 ( Cnn1 ) ] , and did not significantly overlap with Tnni3 - correlated transcripts ( Table S2 in File S2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 48}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
