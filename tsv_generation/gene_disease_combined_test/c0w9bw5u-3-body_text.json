[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] According to the World Health Organization , 1626 laboratory - confirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries . 10 In particular , 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea . 10 MERS - CoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses , HKU4 and HKU5 , providing insight on its evolutionary origin . 11 , 12 MERS - CoV is a polycistronic positive - sense single - stranded RNA virus with a genome of ~ 30 Kb in size . The 5 \u2032 most two - thirds of MERS - CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab , which are further cleaved to yield 16 non - structural proteins , whereas the 3 \u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage - specific proteins . 13 Upon infection , these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host . 14 MERS - CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons ( IFNs ) , including IFN - \u03b1 and - \u03b2 , in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS - CoV - encoded proteins , which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] lending support to the notion that MERS - CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 1006}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
