The program then uses these lists to obtain detailed data on all the E . coli compounds and reactions ( using the ' ' get _ compound _ - data ' ' and ' ' get _ reaction _ data ' ' functions , respectively ) . These data are stored in two tables : one for compounds and one for reactions . Next the ' ' classify _ model _ entities ' ' function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E . coli model . In this particular FVA , the reactions and compounds in the E . coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media ( called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model ) . At this point , the data returned by the ' ' classify _ model _ entities ' ' function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously . In the next step , the code uses the ' ' simulate _ model _ growth ' ' function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E . coli model , maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media ( called Carbon - D - Glucose in the Model SEED ) . The data returned by this function are also added to the reaction and compound tables . In the final call to the server , the program uses the ' ' simulate _ all _ single _ gene _ knockout ' ' function to simulate the single knockout of all E . coli genes , and the results of this study are stored in a gene table . The remainder of the program handles the printing of the compound , reaction , and gene tables to the files CompoundTbl . txt , ReactionTbl . txt , and GeneTbl . txt , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 1254, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
