However , information on MERS - CoV N antigen - specific T cell specificities is still limited . Thus , we aimed first to identify N polypeptide - specific T cell epitopes in BALB / c mice immunized twice with recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N or non - recombinant MVA as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes . Eight days after the final immunization , splenocytes were prepared and the purified CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the N protein . Overlapping peptides were pooled using a two - dimensional , pooled - peptide matrix system ( Table S1 ) and screened by IFN - \u03b3 ELISPOT . The stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA - MERS - N immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of IFN - \u03b3 producing T cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or MVA - control vaccinated animals . Stimulation with the peptides from pools H8 ( n = 10 ) and V8 ( n = 10 ) as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide F2L [ 49 ] ( data not shown ) showed elevated numbers of IFN - \u03b3 spot forming cells ( SFC ) in CD8 + T cell cultures ( Figure 3a , b ) . MVA - MERS - N immunizations given by i . p . and i . m . routes resulted in comparable T cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping N - specific peptides from pools V8 and H8 . In contrast , peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities , as exemplified for peptides in pools V4 and V6 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
