The results show multiple cellular pathways are involved during infection . Using mosquito infection studies in vitro and in vivo , we determine that the ubiquitin - proteasomal system plays a major role during WNV infection in mosquitoes . We also show that Culex cullin ( orthologous to mammalian Cul4A / B ) is induced by WNV infection and blocks Jak - STAT signalling , increasing WNV replication .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 460}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
