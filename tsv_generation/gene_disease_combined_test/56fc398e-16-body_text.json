In the first method , we use random node sampling ( RNS ) such that all movements from a certain percentage of nodes are selected . A more advanced form of node sampling is SBS [ 36 ] . In this method , an initial set of nodes are sampled at random . At the next stage , the nodes captured by the initial sampled nodes are in turn sampled . This process can continue until all nodes have been sampled . In this paper , we consider second - order SBS , such that an initial set of nodes are sampled and the nodes that this set of nodes are connected to are also sampled .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
