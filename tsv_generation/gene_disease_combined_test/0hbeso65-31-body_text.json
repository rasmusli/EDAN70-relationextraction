Several potential targets are suggested : ( 1 ) blocking virus - target cell interaction during attachment and binding ; ( 2 ) interfering with postbinding events and ( 3 ) interfering with viral fusion . Various modalities may be adopted as HCV entry inhibitors : neutralizing antibodies for HCV envelope glycoproteins , blocking antibodies specific for host factors , and small molecular compounds against host factors or viral proteins .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 426}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
