Iterative HFold is significantly more accurate than IPknot while matching the accuracy of HotKnots on the HK - PK data set . Iterative HFold is superior to both IPknot and HotKnots on the IP - pk168 data set . Moreover both Iterative HFold and IPknot use less memory and run much faster than HotKnots on long sequences .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 258}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
