Macrophages in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( 2 / 2 ) mice produced small amounts of TNF - a and IL - 6 , while those in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice produced much larger amounts of these cytokines ( Figure 6F ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 65}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
