HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV - 1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [ 52 , 53 ] . Since the replication of HIV - 1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor - dependent differences , the area under the curve ( AUC ) , representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture , was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure 5A , B , D , E , G , H , J , K ) . Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR - 619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration - dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings , irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV - 1 ( Figure 5A , B , G , H ) . An even more dramatic effect on X4 - and R5 - tropic virus replication was observed under permanent treatment with 5 \u03bcM PR - 619 ( Figure 5D , E ) or 7 . 5 \u03bcM P22077 ( Figure 5J , K ) . Irrespective of treatment schemes , the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 \u03bcM PR - 619 or 15 \u03bcM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4 - and R5 - tropic viruses . In contrast , the USP7 - specific DI P5091 , which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency , did not reduce virus replication ( data not shown ) . To exclude unspecific effects of P22077 and PR - 619 on cell viability , water - soluble tetrazolium salt ( WST ) - 1 assays were performed . Structured treatment with inhibitor concentrations , which completely suppressed HIV - 1 virus replication , had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 5C , I ) . Permanent treatment merely led to a slight , stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80 % at the highest concentration of PR - 619 or P22077 ( Figure 5F , L ) . Altogether , these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration - dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV - 1NL4 - 3 , independently of tropism and treatment scheme , and without showing any toxic effects .
