However , the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA , and conceivably , with nsp1 [UNK] . EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding , which was reduced in the case of PCBP2 KH1m , abolished with PCBP2 KH3m and largely unaffected for PCBP2 KH2 ( Figure 5E ) . Similar results were seen with PCBP1 ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . To assess the capacity of the various PCBPs to bind nsp1 [UNK] independently of RNA , a pull - down assay was utilized ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Here , immobilized GST - nsp1 [UNK] was incubated with individual His - tagged PCBPs and , after a detergent wash , bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting . In comparison to WT PCBP2 , the binding of PCBP2 bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] was unaffected , indicating that the effects on PRF are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with nsp1 [UNK] . Indeed , PCBPs 1 - 4 all bound nsp1 [UNK] in this assay , thus the inability of PCBP4 to trans - activate PRF at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation . Importantly , GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] RBM was able to pull - down PCBP2 , indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
