These results indicated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were not responsible for the rVV - N25 - induced amelioration of histological findings and that other inflammatory cell types may play an as - yet - unidentified role in the resolution of the pathological changes in these mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 149}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
