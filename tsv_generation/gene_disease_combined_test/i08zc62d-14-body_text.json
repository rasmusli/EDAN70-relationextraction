In this way , increasing the concentration of diplacone led to a decrease in both the initial velocity ( v i ) and the steady - state rate ( v s ) ( Figs . 1a , 1b and Supplementary Fig . S3a ) . The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fitted to equation ( 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3a ) to determine v i , v s and k obs . The results for diplacone were fitted to the a slow - binding process ( equation 3 ; Supplementary Fig . S3a ) dependence of k obs on the concentration of bacterial sialidase ( Fig . 1c ) . Based on the above kinetic observations , we conclude that the reaction follows a time - dependent kinetic mechanism ( Fig . 1d ) . From the results of the fit , values of 0 . 201 AE 0 . 003 and 0 . 0017 AE 0 . 004 min \u00c01 were obtained for k 5 and k 6 , respectively . Using these values derived from k obs gives a calculated K i app value of 0 . 065 AE 0 . 008 mM , which is in agreement with the K i ( 0 . 04 mM ) value determined using double - reciprocal plots ( Lineweaver - Burk and Dixon plots ; Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that diplacone inhibits sialidase by the rapid formation of an enzyme complex ( E\u00c1I ) which slowly isomerizes to form a modified enzyme complex ( E [UNK] \u00c1I ) ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . S3b ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 765}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
