However , FcRn could also play a beneficial role in preventing infection after exposure . FcRn mediates the bidirectional transcytosis of IgG , and in immunized individuals , could provide a conduit for antibodies to neutralize virus as shown for herpes simplex virus type 2 [ 19 ] . In addition , IgG immune complexes can prime CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in an FcRn - dependent manner , and FcRn targeting may be a useful mucosal immunization strategy [ 62 , 63 , 64 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 30}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
