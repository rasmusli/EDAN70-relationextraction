A total of 300 samples was measured using the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and anti - HCV ELISA immunoassays . In these 300 cases , we found that the rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA strip and the ELISA - negative one was 78 % ( 234 / 300 ) . The rate of anti - HCV DAS - LFIA - negative but ELISA - positive was 2 % ( 6 / 300 ) . The rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA - positive strip but the ELISAnegative one was 3 . 67 % ( 11 / 300 ) . The rate of the anti - HCV DAS - LFIA and ELISA - positive was 16 . 33 % ( 49 / 300 ) . The concordance between the ELISA and DAS - LFIA methods was 94 . 33 % . The disagreement rate between the ELISA and DAS - LFIA methods was not significant ( \u03c7 2 = 0 . 941 , P = 0 . 332 ) ( Table V ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
