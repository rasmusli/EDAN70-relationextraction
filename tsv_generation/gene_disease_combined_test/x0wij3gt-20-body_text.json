Accumulating epidemiologic and clinical data provide a strong link between inflammation and cancer initiation and progression [ 20 , 21 ] , but the molecular inflammatory determinants remain to be established . COX - 2 derived PGE 2 is a proinflammatory bioactive lipid and is the major prostaglandin produced in many human solid tumors , including cancer of the colon [ 22 ] , stomach [ 23 ] , breast [ 24 ] and lung [ 25 ] . PGE 2 and its receptors play an essential role in promoting cancer progression . For example , PGE 2 significantly enhanced carcinogen induced colon tumor incidence and multiplicity in rats . PGE 2 accelerates intestinal adenoma growth in Apc Min mice [ 26 ] . However , the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear . . Therefore , we will focus on PGE2 and its receptors and its downstream targets in human bronchial epithelial cells , and explore the potential mechanism . This is the first study on the effects of PGE 2 in inducing the activation of cancerpromoting genes in normal bronchial epithelial cells . In concordance with studies performed in tumor cells before , we demonstrate PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c - Jun . It unveils a novel role of c - Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 . Three - phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1 ) is a major mediator of cellular signaling between phosphoinositide - 3 kinase and various intracellular serine / threonine kinases , including PKB , p70 ribosomal S6 kinase , serum and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase , and protein kinase . PDK1 is able to phosphorylate Thr - 308 on PKB\u03b1 [ 27 , 28 ] , which has been shown to play a crucial role in normal and pathophysical conditions . Activation of PDK1 has been shown to regulate cell survival and growth , cell cycle progression , gene expression and differention [ 9 , 29 ] . Autophosphorylation and growth - factorinduced phosphorylation in its activation loop is required for PDK1 activity [ 30 ] . S241A mutation abolished PDK1 catalytic activity completely , which suggests phosphorylation at Ser - 241 is important for PDK1 signaling [ 31 ] . There is increasing evidence that PDK1 is involved in cancer progression and invasion . Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer has revealed that phosphorylation of PDK1 on Ser - 241 was strongly enhanced in 90 % of the samples tested [ 11 ] . Immunohistochemical analysis using anti - phospho - Tyr - 9 antibodies demonstrated that the level of Tyr - 9 phosphorylation is increased markly in diseased lung , liver , colon , and breast tissue compared to normal tissue [ 12 ] . Studies have shown that angiotension - II - induced focal adhesion formation is inhibited by infection with Adeno - PDK1 - Y9F via paxillin [ 10 ] . This regulation of focal adhesion suggests that PDK1 participates in integrating signals that control cell growth , apoptosis and migration . PDK1 gene has been assoiated with poor differentiation of late stage lung cancer [ 32 ] . PDK1 was shown capable of augmenting tumorigenesis in tissues harboring ERBB2 amplifications [ 33 ] , PTEN deletions [ 34 ] , and mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PIK3CA ) [ 35 ] . Inhibition of PDK1 is therefore expected to attenuate tumors associated with deregulated PIK3CA / PTEN signaling . Indeed , hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 in Pten + / \u2212 mice delays the onset of tumorigenesis , and small molecule inhibitors of PDK1 inhibit tumor xenografts and lung colonization [ 36 ] . Further , PDK1 inactivation effectively attenuated the development of Kras oncogene - driven pancreatic cancer , but not NSCLC , further supporting the importance of PDK1 in tumor development , albeit , in select cancer types [ 37 ] . Here , we found that PGE2 increased the expression of PDK1 in bronchial epithelial cells . Overexpression of PDK1 enhanced cell proliferation , while cells stimulated with PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA reduced cell growth . These findings provides the first genetic evidence that PDK1 may also play an essential role in abnormally enhanced cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in bronchial epithelial cells , which was convinced in tumor cells in previous studies . Consistent with former studies , PDK1 inactivations by small molecule inhibitor of PDK1 or siRNA effectively attenuated cell proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells , supporting the potential importance of PDK1 in NSCLC development . PDK1 also plays a crucial role in metastasis . This kinase mediates mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype , in part , by membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) induction , which in turn activates MMP - 2 and modulates the extracellular matrix proteins decorin and collagen [ 11 ] . Knockdown of PDK1 inhibits spontaneous migration and epidermal - growth - factor - induced chemotaxis in breast cancer cells . In severe combined immunodeficiency mice , PDK1 - depleted human breast cancer cells form tumors more slowly and are defective in extravasation to the lungs after intravenous injection [ 38 ] . These results indicate that PDK1 plays an important role in regulating malignancy in breast cancer cells . Moreover , reducing PDK1 expression in PTEN + / \u2212 mice protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors [ 36 ] , thereby providing genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia that result from loss of PTEN . In addition , PDK1 is an upstream kinase of AKT , which regulates activities of AKT , in turn , mediates the regulation of tumor cell growth , metastasis , and angiogenesis [ 39 ] . All these results validate PDK1 is a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 151}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
