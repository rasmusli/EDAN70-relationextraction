Wang et al . [ 19 ] found that the infundibulum was the only section of the oviduct to be lacking sialic acids to which both the lectins Maackia amurensis ( MAA ) and the Sambucus nigra ( SNA ) could attach , while in the rest of the oviduct MAA bound abundantly to the epithelium , hence revealing a prevalence of avian - like \u03b1 - 2 , 3 sialic acids . Mork et al . [ 50 ] reported a completely different binding profile for the infundibulum , in which both SNA and MAA II abundantly attached to the epithelium , while in the rest of the oviduct , they confirmed a significant higher expression of \u03b1 - 2 , 3 sialic acids binding to both MAA I and MAA II , a result in keeping with the data by Sid et al . [ 42 ] . The apparent contradiction of these data likely derives from the different types , brands and concentrations of lectins and revelation methods adopted in the two studies [ 51 , 52 ] . To overcome these issues , we opted for an alternative approach , incubating the oviduct histological sections with the labelled H9N2 virus and revealing its attachment by means of immunohistochemistry . The results confirmed that this virus has a strong specific preference for the cilia of the infundibulum epithelium , while in the magnum and uterus the virus attaches less than in the infundibulum , and even fails to do so at the level of the isthmus . These data , together with the higher incidence and severity of infections observed in the infundibulum , indicate that the high affinity of this virus for the receptors expressed in this section of the oviduct might be one of the main etiological determinants of the disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 264}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
