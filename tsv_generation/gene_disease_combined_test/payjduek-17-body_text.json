One possible mechanism is the reactivation and multiplication of live but dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG bacilli that may have been present at the inoculation site , facilitated by immune suppression induced by measles infection . In one previous case report , a severely malnourished 2 . 5year old boy developed ulceration of a healed BCG scar and possible disseminated BCG infection 2 weeks after measles infection [ 20 ] . Acid - fast bacilli was detected from a swab of the BCG ulcer . This mechanism is , however , unlikely in our patient in view of the rapid onset and resolution of the BCG site erythema / induration with the appearance and resolution of the measles rash . Immune suppression induced by measles would normally be expected to persist for a longer duration [ 21 ] . In addition , the lack of malnutrition in the patient , the otherwise uncomplicated measles course , and the absence of secondary infections normally seen in severe immunosuppressed states further renders this mechanism unlikely . Another possible mechanism for the BCG reactivation , which appears more probable , is an immune - mediated reaction . Cross - reactivity between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins ( HSP ) , in particular mycobacterial HSP 65 and human homologue HSP 63 , have been postulated as the cause of BCG reactivation in children with Kawasaki disease [ 22 , 23 ] . HSP are ubiquitous molecules present in all organisms , including humans , and mediate important functions in protein folding , assembly and transport essential for cell survival [ 24 ] . Synthesis of HSP are increased during conditions of cellular stress , including infection , ischaemia and other physical stresses . In humans , increased production and serum concentrations of HSP , especially HSP 70 , have been reported during viral infections , including measles [ 25 , 26 ] . As homology between HSP 70 and mycobacterial antigens have been demonstrated [ 27 ] , a similar cross - reactivity as thought to occur in children with Kawasaki disease could possibly also explain the BCG reactivation in our patient . These mechanisms are especially intriguing as measles infections typically cause suppression of delayed type hyper and anergy to tuberculin [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 33}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
