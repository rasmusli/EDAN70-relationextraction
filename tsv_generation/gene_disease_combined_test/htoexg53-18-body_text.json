Splenocytes were added to 96 - well plates ( 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells / well ) and stimulated for 6 h with MERS - CoV N - specific peptide ( at 8 \u00b5g peptide / mL RPMI 1640 medium ) in presence of the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A ( Biolegend , San Diego , CA , USA ; 5 \u00b5g / mL ) . Non - stimulated cells served as a background control and cells stimulated with 5 ng / mL PMA and 500 ng / mL ionomycin or with F2L peptide ( 8 \u00b5g / mL RPMI 1640 medium ) were used as positive controls . After stimulation , cell surface antigens were stained using PE - conjugated anti - mouse CD3 ( clone : 17A2 , Biolegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) , PE / Cy7 - conjugated anti - mouse CD4", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 574}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
