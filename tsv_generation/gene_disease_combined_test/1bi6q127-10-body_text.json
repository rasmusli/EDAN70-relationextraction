Such excessive inflammation is detrimental in vertebrates of other species , such as humans , and is linked to pathology [ 28 ] . So , it is beneficial for the bats to have evolved mechanisms that would allow them to control excessive inflammation . Cell culture experiments have shown that cells of several species of bats have an inhibitor molecule ( cRel ) binding site in the promoter region of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF\u03b1 ) , a key inflammatory cytokine . In cells of big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus ) , stimulated with poly I : C , a surrogate for double - stranded viral RNA , cRel actively suppresses TNF\u03b1 expression [ 29 ] . Genome analysis of black flying foxes and David ' s myotis have also demonstrated positive selection pressure on the cRel gene [ 21 ] . This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNF\u03b1 , thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 133}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
