This appears to be because MFE structures predicted by SimFold tend to have more base pairs than the true pseudoknot free structure , G big , so that HFold and Iterative HFold are unlikely to add pseudoknotted base pairs to the input structure . For pseudoknotfree structures , using SimFold as input is somewhat better than using HotKnots hotspots , but the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 55}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
