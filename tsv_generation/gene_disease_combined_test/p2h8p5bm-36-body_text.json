It is produced as a product of incomplete degradation of genomic viral RNA by cellular 5 - 3 exoribonuclease XRN1 [ 184 ] . The ability to produce sfRNA in WNV was shown to be needed for efficient viral growth in vitro and for pathogenicity in mice [ 184 ] . Interestingly , DENV sfRNA was found to bind to TRIM25 to inhibit RIG - I - induced type I interferon expression in Huh - 7 cells [ 186 ] . Furthermore , DENV and WNV sfRNA was found to suppress the RNAi response in both mammalian and insect cells [ 187 ] . Similarly , in TBEV infection , sfRNA has been demonstrated to inhibit the antiviral RNAi response in tick cells [ 93 ] . PEPD is needed for maturation and subsequent transport of IFNAR1 to the plasma membrane . IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 heterodimer on plasma membrane can be activated by IFN\u03b1 / \u03b2 which leads to the signaling cascade and phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1 / 2 - IRF9 into the nucleus and upregulation of ISGs . Right panel : NS5 interferes with IFN signaling . NS5 protein interacts with PEPD thus preventing IFNAR1 plasma membrane localization ( red T ) . NS5 also prevents STAT1 phosphorylation ( red T ) . Arrows indicate protein transport .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
