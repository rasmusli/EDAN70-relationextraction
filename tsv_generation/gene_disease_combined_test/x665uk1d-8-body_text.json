The DNAs coding for both the wild - type 3D8 scFv protein ( SCH ) and the inactive DNase - mutated 3D8 scFv protein ( muSCH ) were cloned under the transcriptional dependence of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3 . 1 / V5 - HisB vector ( Figure 1A ) . Three 3D8 scFv lines ( SCH07041 , SCH07071 , and SCH07072 ) and mutated 3D8 scFv ( muSCH ) were selected by serial dilution in media containing G418 [ 28 ] . We evaluated 3D8 scFv expression levels in selected cell lines by quantitative real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , flow cytometric analysis , and immunocytochemistry . According to quantitative real - time RT - PCR , SCH07072 expressed the highest 3D8 scFv RNA compared to that of the other two cell lines ( 1 . 3 and 4 times more ) . The mutant 3D8 scFv - transfected ( muSCH ) cells expressed similar levels of 3D8 scFv RNA to SCH07072 ( Figure 1B ) . Flow cytometry data revealed that when the mean for the HeLa cell line as a control was 79 . 48 , SCH07041 , SCH07071 , and SCH07072 were 88 . 45 , 109 . 17 , and 126 . 38 , respectively ( Geo mean : HeLa = 74 . 51 , SCH07041 = 76 . 88 , SCH07071 = 89 . 89 , and SCH07072 = 115 . 33 ) and was similar to the results shown in the quantitative real - time RT - PCR analysis ( Figure 1C ) . Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 and muSCH were targeted and localized in both the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure 1D ) . Common features of anti - DNA antibodies that have a large number of positively - charged residues within complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) of VH or VL domains due to their antigen binding properties , which resemble the nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells , such as cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) [ 29 ] . Therefore , 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in the cytosol using a vector system and targeted to the nucleus by a NLS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
