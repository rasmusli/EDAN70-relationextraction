Although ORF2 is an N - linked glycoprotein , which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum , recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro - translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm , where it is detected as a non - glycosylated protein . Importantly , in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates , retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm [ 16 ] . Thus , cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with \u03b2TRCP . Indeed , experiments done using \u039435 ORF2 protein suggest that non - glycosylated , cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with \u03b2TRCP and inhibiting NF - \u03baB activity . Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
