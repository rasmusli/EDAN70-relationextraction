The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function , P ( t ) , and as such the average infectious period , denoted by 1 / c , is given by R ' 0 P\u00f0t\u00dedt [ 21 ] . The probability density function of the infectious period , p ( t ) , is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function , \u00c0dP ( t ) / dt . Different functional forms for p ( t ) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model . For example , setting p ( t ) equal to e \u00c0ct / c recovers the classical exponentially distributed SIR model . More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing p ( t ) to be a gamma probability density function [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] , with parameters c and n ( see Protocol S1 ) . An alternative ( and computationally efficient ) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nc being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses . The advantage of this formalism is that when n \u00bc 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model , which has a large variance , while as n ! ' we obtain a fixed infectious period . The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A ; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 472}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
