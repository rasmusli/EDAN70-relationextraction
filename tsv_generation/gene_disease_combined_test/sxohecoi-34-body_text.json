Plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature ( RT ) . After washing , capture antibodies were added at 5 mg / ml ( 250 ng / well ) , and plates were incubated an additional hour at RT . Next , virus was added to washed plates ( 20 ng p24 / well ) and incubated for 3 hours at 37uC . Unbound virus was removed by washing with PBS . Subsequently , 1610 4 TZM - bl cells / well were added in the presence of 10 mg / ml DEAE dextran and incubated for 48 hours at 37uC . Cells were then washed , lysed , and developed with luciferase assay reagent according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Promega ) . Luminescence ( relative light units ) was measured using a Synergy 2 microplate luminometer ( BioTek ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
