On one hand , the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On the other hand , the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing . The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN - antagonizing property . Both the MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3phosphorylating complex of TRAF3 \u00b7 TANK \u00b7 TBK1 / IKK - \u03b5 was affected by their N - terminal transmembrane domains . 30 , 32 Interestingly , in the case of community - acquired human coronavirus HKU1 , which normally causes common cold in infected individuals , its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property , 32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV pathogenesis . Using a side - by - side comparison of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV M proteins , we discovered that the extent by which the MERS - CoV M protein suppressed IFN - \u03b2 promoter activity was lower than that by SARS - CoV M protein . This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS - CoV M protein with other transducers . Whereas the MERS - CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3 , its interaction with TBK1 or IKK - \u03b5 was undetectable ( data not shown ) . This distinguished MERS - CoV M protein from the SARS - CoV M protein , which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3 \u00b7 TANK \u00b7 TBK1 / IKK - \u03b5 complex . 30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS - CoV pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
