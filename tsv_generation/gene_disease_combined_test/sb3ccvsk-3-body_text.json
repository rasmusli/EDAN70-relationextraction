While the detection of viral antigens and antiviral antibodies in MS brains supports a role for viral infections in triggering autoimmunity ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) , the \" hygiene hypothesis \" rather proposes a protective function ( 6 , 7 ) , underlining the ambiguous link between viral infections and MS ( 8 ) . This dichotomy between viral infections and autoimmune diseases is reflected in two prominent models of viral - induced demyelination , i . e . , Theiler ' s murine encephalomyelitis virus ( TMEV ) and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus ( MHV ) . During persistent TMEV infection , activation of SR T cells by epitope spreading triggers an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and ascending paralysis ( 9 , 10 ) . By contrast , despite ongoing demyelination , persistent neurotropic MHV infections are defined by clinical recovery with no evidence for autoimmune - mediated clinical symptoms ( 11 , 12 ) . Nevertheless , our recent study demonstrated that endogenous SR T cells are activated specifically during chronic infection , correlating with kinetics of JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus ( JHMV ) - induced demyelination ( 13 ) . However , the endogenous SR T cell response declined despite sustained myelin loss during viral persistence and the preserved ability of antigen - presenting cells from both cervical lymph nodes ( CLN ) and the CNS to activate myelin - specific CD4 + T cells ex vivo . These findings suggested that chronic JHMV infection actively induces suppressive mechanisms to limit the development of autoimmunity . Immune regulation associated with viral infections requires a delicate balance between promoting effective virus clearance while limiting tissue damage . This is especially critical within the CNS due to its limited regenerative capacity . Following JHMV infection , T cells primarily control infectious virus within the brain and spinal cords within 2 weeks . Nevertheless , viral persistence is evident by ongoing detection of viral RNA predominantly within spinal cords . Demyelination is initiated during T cell - mediated control of viral replication , peaks subsequent to virus control , but continues throughout persistence ( 12 ) . Induction of Foxp3 + regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) and type 1 regulatory T ( Tr1 ) cells and their migration to the CNS are already evident during the acute infection ( 14 , 15 ) . Both regulatory populations are known to control autoimmune diseases ( 16 , 17 ) . Prior studies of their role during JHMV infection demonstrated that Tr1 cells have a limited effect on tissue damage ( 15 ) , while Foxp3 + Tregs restrict the extent of demyelination without affecting viral persistence ( 18 , 19 ) . Indeed , depletion of CD25 + regulatory CD4 + T cells prior JHMV infection correlated with increased myelin loss during viral persistence ( 19 ) . Similarly , transfer of naive Foxp3 + Tregs into acutely JHMV - infected mice improved clinical disease and restricted tissue damage without altering control of virus replication ( 20 ) . The limited role of Foxp3 + Tregs in virus clearance was also confirmed by unaltered antiviral T cell responses following Foxp3 + Treg depletion during acute infection with the less pathogenic MHV - A59 strain ( 21 ) . However , the same study showed that Foxp3 + Tregs limited proliferation of transferred SR T cells in the CLN ( 21 ) . Altogether , these data support the notion that Foxp3 + Tregs limit tissue damage by specifically counteracting the activation of endogenous SR T cells , without apparent affects on antiviral T cells . However , in all these studies , transfer or depletion of Foxp3 + Tregs were performed during acute MHV infection , prior to the induction of endogenous SR T cells ( 13 ) , limiting knowledge of their function during persistence . Regulation of in vivo primed SR T cells and immunopathology by endogenous Foxp3 + Treg during persistence remains unexplored .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 286}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
