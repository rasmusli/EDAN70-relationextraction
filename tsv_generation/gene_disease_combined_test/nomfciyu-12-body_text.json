Whereas , MERS spike antigen were positive in epithelial layers of submucosal bronchial glands , lungs of NHPs and in some cells in BALTs [ 53 ] . Dual Immunohistochemistry method was applied using monoclonal antibody against MERS spike protein and CD26 , the staining showed that MERS was found in CD26 positive cells but were negative in NHPs [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 146}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
