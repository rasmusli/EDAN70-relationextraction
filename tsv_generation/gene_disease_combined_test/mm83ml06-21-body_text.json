To perform single round infections , we generated vesicular stomatitis virus - glycoprotein ( VSV - G ) pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs by transfecting HEK293T cells that were either incubated with the DIs P22077 or PR - 619 , or left untreated . VLPs were isolated and subsequently used for single round infections in TZM - bl cells , and infectivity was ascertained by measuring \u03b2 - galactosidase activity . Treatment with 15 \u00b5M or 20 \u00b5M P22077 reduced the infectivity of released VLPs up to 2 - fold , and 5 - fold , respectively ( Figure 3 ) . Similarly , the infectivity of VLPs , generated under treatment with 7 \u00b5M or 14 \u00b5M PR - 619 , was about 4 - or even 10 - fold diminished . Thus , VLPs produced under DUB inhibition exhibit loss of specific infectivity , most likely due to impaired Gag processing .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
