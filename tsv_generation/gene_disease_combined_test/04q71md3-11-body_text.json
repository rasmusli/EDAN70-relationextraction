The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [ 21 ] into a generalized linear model ( GLM ) , by parameterizing each rate of among - location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors . For each predictor j , the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient b j , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor ( in log space ) , and a binary indicator variable d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model . We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection ( BSSVS ) [ 22 , 23 ] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor . This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre - defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among - location movement while simultaneously", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 506}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
