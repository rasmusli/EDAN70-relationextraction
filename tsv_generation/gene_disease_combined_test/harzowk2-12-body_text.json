The target of amplification for hMPV was the nucleoprotein gene ( N gene ) with primer sequences and method as described by Hopkins et al . and 45 cycles were run on real - time PCR ( ABI prism 7900 HT FAST ) [ 17 ] . Positive and negative controls were included , and a Ct value of \u2264 37 was considered positive . The target of amplification for MP was the ADPribosylating toxin gene encoding the CARDS ( communityacquired respiratory distress syndrome ) toxin using primer pairs and method as described by Winchell et al . [ 18 ] . Both internal DNA control and a positive and negative control were included in the reaction run . A Ct value \u2264 34 was considered positive .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 179}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
