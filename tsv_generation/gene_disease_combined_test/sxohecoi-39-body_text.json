Detergent - solubilized Env from HIV - 1 US657 was captured by a polyclonal sheep anti - gp120 antibody ( D7324 , Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd ) . Sample IgG and an anti - gp120 mAb standard ( b6 ) were serially diluted , added to wells , washed , and detected by anti - human IgG ( gamma ) - HRP ( Sigma - Aldrich , A6029 ) antibody . Plates were subsequently developed , stopped , and read at OD 450 nm . The concentrations of Env - specific IgG in the seminal and CVL IgG samples were calculated using the mAb b6 standard and are reported as a percent of total IgG in each sample .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 19}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
