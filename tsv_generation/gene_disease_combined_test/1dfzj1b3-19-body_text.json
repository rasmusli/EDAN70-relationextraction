These species are highly unstable , short - lived intermediates that stabilize themselves by abstracting hydrogen from another chemical species or rapidly react with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical ( propagation phase ) . In the propagation phase , peroxyl radicals formed can further oxidise the lipid , producing hydroperoxides .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
