In order to check whether ORF2 inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 ubiquitination , we checked the level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 in ORF2 expressing cells . Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG - 132 for 2 hours , I\u03baB\u03b1 was immunoprecipitated , followed by immunblotting with anti - ubiquitin antibody . Protein level of ubiquitinated I\u03baB\u03b1 was significantly decreased in full - length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A top panel , lane 1 and 2 ) . A similar effect ( lane 3 ) was observed following expression of a mutant ORF2 protein ( \u039435 ) with ER signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm [ 15 ] . Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody to confirm its presence ( Figure 3A , middle panel ) . A parallel set of samples were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix , immunoprecipitated with anti - ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full - length and \u039435 ORF2 protein ( Figure 3A , bottom panel ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
