A primary function of NOSTRIN is to modulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) by sequestering eNOS away from the plasma membrane ( Zimmermann et al . 2002 ) . In turn , this prevents the calcium - mediated release of nitric oxide ( NO ) ( Zimmermann et al . 2002 ) , a potent modifier of cardiac function , including regulation of contractility ( Massion et al . 2003 ; Petroff et al . 2001 ) . Alternative splicing of Nostrin produces a truncated isoform ( NOSTRIN - b ) which is primarily localized to the nucleus ( Wiesenthal et al . 2009 ) and represses transcription from its own promoter ( Kim et al . 2005 ; Wiesenthal et al . 2009 ) . Therefore NOSTRIN - b could also influence transcription of other genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network . A model can be envisaged where NOSTRIN - b alters expression of RBM20 ( the linkage peak for the Rbm20 eQTL contains Nostrin ) , leading to altered splicing of Nostrin ( as well as other key myocyte genes ) , to provide feedback from stretch - induced NO release and result in altered contractile properties . Interestingly , RBM20 has been shown to directly influence alternative splicing of Zfp451 and Ttn ( Guo et al . 2013 ) , both of which were identified as candidate upstream regulators in the other two eQTL peaks identified in this study . The eQTL interval located at Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network : Rab23 and Zfp451 . Since a defined relationship exists between ZFP451 and cardiac function , we suggest that ZFP451 is the better candidate . Z has been shown to bind directly to SMAD3 / 4 which prevents recruitment of p300 to target promoters and results in the downregulation of transforming growth factor - b ( TGFb ) target genes in A549 lung epithelial cells ( Feng et al . 2014 ) . This is relevant since transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of TGFb 1 were shown to develop atrial but not ventricular fibrosis and had increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation ( Nakajima et al . 2000 ; Verheule et al . 2004 ) . Upregulation of TGFb 1 is also known to induce myocardial hypertrophy ( Parker et al . 1990 ) and is evident in animal models of heart failure ( Dobaczewski et al . 2011 ) . However , therapies which block TGFb would be expected to have adverse effects due to the pleiotropic nature of TGFb signaling ( Dobaczewski et al . 2011 ) . In future studies , it will be important to determine if ZFP451 expression in the pulmonary myocardium and heart of atrial fibrillation patients is altered in parallel with increased TGFb expression ; if so , this transcription factor might be a viable therapeutic target .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
