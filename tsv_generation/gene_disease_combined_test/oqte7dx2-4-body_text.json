However , emerging evidence indicate that DUBs have very specific cellular functions and are selective for certain substrates and ubiquitin chain types , suggesting that precise mechanisms exist to regulate DUBs ( Clague et al . , 2013 ) . Although some DUBs , such as UCH - L1 , have been heavily studied in the nervous system , the function and regulation of most neuronal DUBs are poorly understood ( Todi and Paulson , 2011 ; Kowalski and Juo , 2012 ) . In this review article , we illustrate potential mechanisms of DUB regulation by focusing on the role of the conserved DUB USP46 in the nervous system , and ways in which two WD40 - repeat ( WDR ) proteins control its function . We highlight recent structural insights into how WDR proteins interact with and regulate USP46 , and discuss functions for the USP46 / WDR protein complex in the nervous system and across phylogeny .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 25, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
