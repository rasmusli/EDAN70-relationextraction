MIA against viral or bacterial infections influences the developing fetal central nervous system ( CNS ) , and increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) later in life [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . It has been suggested that MIA has a strong impact on microglial development , and microglial disturbance disrupts neurogenesis , neuronal migration , and myelination , thus leading to consequent impairments in the brain function of the offspring 2 . Based on these findings , MIA is believed to be a disease primer 1 . It has also been reported that MIA and MIA - induced fetal neuroinflammation stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and disturbances in pro - inflammatory cytokine production in the fetal brain 8 , 9 . These changes are reported to Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure . Since MIA has been considered to be a cause of behavioral abnormalities in offspring , including ASD / Schizophrenia - like behavior , we subsequently evaluated the effect of LPS and maternal administration of HW on short - term memory , sociability , social novelty , and sensorimotor gating . As shown in Fig . 2A , spontaneous alternation was markedly reduced in the LPS group than in the Control group ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the Y - maze test , which is indicative of impaired short - term memory . Treatment with H 2 significantly attenuated the LPS - induced impairment of short - term memory ( p < 0 . 05 ) . There was no difference in the total number of arm entries among the three groups ( Control , 24 . 0 \u00b1 1 . 3 ; LPS , 22 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 61 ; HW + LPS , 22 . 7 \u00b1 0 . 91 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
