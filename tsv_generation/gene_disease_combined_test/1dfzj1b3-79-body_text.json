At the same time , there is also an induction of the activity of several enzymes ( oxygenases , nitric oxide synthases , peroxidases ) as well as the arachidonic acid metabolism . In the inflammatory process there is also the expression of cellular adhesion molecules , such as intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 194}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
