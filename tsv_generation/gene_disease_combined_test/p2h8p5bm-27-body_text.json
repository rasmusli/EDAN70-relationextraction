These subunits are associated with Janus activated kinases ( JAK ) localized in the cytoplasm ; IFNAR1 interacts with tyrosine kinase - 2 ( Tyk2 ) , whereas IFNAR2 interacts with JAK1 . Ligation of IFNAR results in activation of Tyk2 and JAK1 , which subsequently phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) - 1 and STAT - 2 . Phosphorylated STAT - 1 and STAT - 2 then form a heterodimer , which associates with IRF9 to form IFN - stimulated gene factor - 3 ( ISGF3 ) that binds to the IFN - stimulated response element ( ISRE ) in the promoter of many ISGs to enhance the transcription of several hundreds of IFN - stimulated genes [ 110 , 139 , 140 ] . Together , these ISGs act to coordinate an antiviral response that is able to inhibit almost any step in the viral life cycle [ 140 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
