We found that PCBP2 alone did not affect PRF ( right hand lane ) , but when added together with nsp1 [UNK] , synthesis of the \u2212 1 PRF product was stimulated some 3 - fold ( see Supplementary Table ) . We reasoned that if the ' active ' trans - acting stimulator of PRF in PRRSV is a complex of nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP , the RRL system may already contain an abundant form of PCBP , but one which would , in complex with nsp1 [UNK] , preferentially induce \u2212 2 PRF . In this experiment , supplementation with PCBP2 may have generated nsp1 [UNK] - PCBP2 complexes that could preferentially promote \u2212 1 PRF . We therefore translated the PRRSV frameshift reporter mRNA in the WG in vitro translation system on the basis that this lysate might contain fewer endogenous PCBPs , or PCBPs of sufficient evolutionary divergence to preclude any interactions with nsp1 [UNK] . Consistent with our hypothesis , PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addition of both nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP2 , with neither protein alone having any frameshift - stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B ) . Further , supplementation of WG translations with PCBP2 led preferentially to a \u2212 1 PRF , whereas with human PCPB1 , \u2212 2 PRF was most evident ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the abundant form in RRL is PCBP1 . We also tested mouse PCBP3 , human PCBP4 and mouse hn - RNP K / J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D ) . Of these three proteins , only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting , with both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ) . We confirmed the involvement of PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured cells using siRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF , with PCBP1 noticeably affecting \u2212 2 PRF , and PCBP2 , \u2212 1 PRF , consistent with the results of the WG assays above . No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3 , PCBP4 or hnRNP K / J , although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
