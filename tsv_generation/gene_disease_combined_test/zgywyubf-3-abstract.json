Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 was not altered , its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells . Further analysis revealed that ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F - box protein , beta transducin repeat containing protein ( \u03b2TRCP ) and ORF2 over expression resulted in reduced association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with the SKP1 and CUL1 components of the SCF \u03b2TRCP complex . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay of the proximal promoter regions of MHC - I heavy chain and IL - 8 genes using p65 antibody and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p65 with the above regions , indicating that ORF2 inhibited p65 binding at endogenous promoters . Conclusions : In this report we suggest a mechanism by which ORF2 protein of HEV may inhibit host cell NF - \u03baB activity during the course of a viral infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 96}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
