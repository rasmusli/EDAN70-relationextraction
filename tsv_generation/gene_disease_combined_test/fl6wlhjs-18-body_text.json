To complete the model we assume that { X k , t } is a zero mean stationary time series ( we discuss the consequences of this assumption in the Discussion ) , that we shall represent using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average process ( SARIMA ) . The SARIMA model ( defined in the Appendix ) allows for simultaneous modeling of dependencies on both the day as well as the weekly seasonal scales . To aid in the comparison of the dependencies across cities , the order of the time series model , as determined by choosing the autoregressive ( p k and P k ) and moving average orders ( q k and Q k ) , will be the same for each city k .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 761, "end": 765}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
