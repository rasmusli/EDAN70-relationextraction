The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL , the epidemiological role of the cat in L . infantum infection , clinical manifestations , and recommendations on diagnosis , treatment and monitoring , prognosis and prevention of infection , in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats . The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence - based studies and case reports , clinical experience and critical consensus discussions . While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis , clinical illness due to L . infantum in cats is rare . The prevalence rates of feline infection with L . infantum in serological or molecular - based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 % . Cats are able to infect sand flies and , therefore , they may act as a secondary reservoir , with dogs being the primary natural reservoir . The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative , exfoliative , crusting or nodular dermatitis ( mainly on the head or distal limbs ) , ocular lesions ( mainly uveitis ) , feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome , mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions , hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia . Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence , as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy . Diagnosis is based on serology , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , cytology , histology , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) or culture . If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL , the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods ( cytology , histology with IHC , PCR , culture ) should be employed . The most common treatment used is allopurinol . Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases . Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy . Follow - up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests , serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses . Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
