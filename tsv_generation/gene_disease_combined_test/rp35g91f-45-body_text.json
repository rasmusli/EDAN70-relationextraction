Of these TTN - interacting proteins , FHL2 interacts with the N2B domain ( present in both isoforms ) , while CARP interacts with the N2A domain ( present only in the longer N2BA isoform ) ( Linke 2008 ) . Both FHL2 and CARP have been shown to act as transcription factors in response to specific stimuli . For example , CARP is upregulated at the myofibril and in the nucleus in response to stretch ( Miller et al . 2003 ) , while FHL2 is upregulated in response to RhoA signaling ( Philippar et al . 2004 ) . FHL2 has also been shown to interact with SRF to antagonize expression of smooth muscle genes in differentiating embryonic stem cells ( Philippar et al . 2004 ) . Similarly , CARP overexpression in murine neonatal cardiomyocytes represses expression of Anf , Actc1 , Acta1 , bMHC , ventricular myosin light chain 2 ( Myl2 ) , and cardiac troponin C ( Tnnc ) ( Mikhailov and Torrado Figure 5 A model for pulmonary myocardium gene regulation in response to hemodynamic stress . Based on our gene network analysis we propose that hemodynamic changes trigger mechanosensory ( stretch - stress ) signaling from the sarcomere via TTN , and initiate NO signaling cascades which are transmitted to the myocyte nucleus via NOSTRIN . These signals initiate dynamic regulation of gene expression to enable finetuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium . Gene expression changes may also be regulated at the post - transcriptional level by RBM20 which could feedback to regulate Nostrin , Ttn , and Zfp451 . Collectively , these effects are predicted to result in altered contractile properties , ion handling , and hormonal signaling in the pulmonary myocardium to direct an effective response to the initial hemodynamic cue . 2008 ) ; genes which are associated with our pulmonary myocardium gene network . We therefore propose a model whereby mechanosensing by TTN could lead to altered gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network via FHL2 or CARP ( Figure 5 ) , which might exert opposing transcriptional effects depending on the TTN isoform expressed ( as CARP signaling would only be activated by the N2BA isoform ) . Interestingly , Fhl2 had one of the highest fold - changes in expression in the left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation compared to healthy controls ( Deshmukh et al . 2015 ) , supporting a role for dysregulated TTN signaling in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 51}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
