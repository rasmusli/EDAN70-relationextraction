Because the over - activation of immune cells , including astrocytes , could have an adverse effect on neurons with the overproduction of pro - inflammatory cytokines 34 , we investigated the anti - inflammatory effect of H 2 on astrocyte using primary cultured astrocyte . As shown in Fig . 5 , stimulation of astrocytes with LPS for three hours led to marked increases in tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 ( TNF - \u03b1 ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) , interleukin ( IL ) - 1\u03b2 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and IL - 6 ( p < 0 . 001 ) mRNA expression . These increases in expression of TNF - \u03b1 ( p < 0 . 01 ) , IL - 1\u03b2 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and IL - 6 ( p < 0 . 05 ) were significantly attenuated by H 2 treatment . Altered gene expression patterns in primary cultured astrocytes from the Control group , the LPS group , and the HW + LPS group . As we previously described the gene expression profile of microglia 12 , differential gene expression patterns of astrocytes from newborn mice in the Control group , the LPS group , and the HW + LPS group were also observed ( Tables S1 - S4 , Supplementary Information ) . These results suggest that H 2 might also influence the function not only of microglia but also of astrocytes via changes in gene expression .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 249}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
