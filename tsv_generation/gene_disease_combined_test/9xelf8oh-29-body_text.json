Arm skin had the highest RQ of SQPV DNA ( RQ mean = 1937 \u00b1 3692 CI , n = 7 ) , and digit skin was the second most intensely infected area ( RQ mean = 24 \u00b1 24 CI , n = 4 ) ( Fig . 3a ) . Of all cutaneous swabs taken , arm swabs yielded the most SQPV DNA ( RQ mean = 29 \u00b1 47 CI , n = 6 ) . It appears virus is present over much of the body with all cutaneous swabs and tissue showing 100 % SQPV presence in infected individuals . In contrast to grey squirrels , non - cutaneous samples also showed high infection rates in red squirrels but with somewhat lower infection intensities when compared to cutaneous samples ( Fig . 3b ) . For example , blood showed the highest RQ of the non - cutaneous tissues tested ( RQ mean = 0 . 097 \u00b1 0 . 16 CI , n = 7 ) , while rectal swabs provided the highest recovery of SQPV DNA ( RQ mean = 0 . 23 \u00b1 0 . 33 CI , n = 7 ) ; indeed , the recovery of SQPV from rectum was comparable to the relative quantity of SQPV DNA found in faeces ( RQ mean = 0 . 18 \u00b1 0 . 22 CI , n = 5 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
