The same fatty acid is metabolised by cyclooxygenase ( COX ) and lipoxygenase ( LOX ) pathways in different eicosanoids such as prostaglandins ( PGs ) and leukotrienes ( LTs ) in diverse cells and thromboxane A 2 in platlets [ 22 ] . Two isoforms of COX , COX - 1 and COX - 2 , have been reported . COX - 1 is a constitutive enzyme whilst COX - 2 protein is only slightly expressed in most normal mammalian tissues in response to physical , chemical and biological stimuli , including UV light exposure , dioxin and LPS ( lipopolyssacharide ) insult [ 96 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
