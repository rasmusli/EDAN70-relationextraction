Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide ' slippery ' sequence . The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans - acting protein factor , the viral replicase subunit nsp1 [UNK] . Here we show that the the trans - activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1 [UNK] and a cellular poly ( C ) binding protein ( PCBP ) . From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrate that a PCBP / nsp1 [UNK] complex binds to a C - rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF . This is the first description of a role for a trans - acting cellular protein in PRF . The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly ( C ) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus - host interactions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
