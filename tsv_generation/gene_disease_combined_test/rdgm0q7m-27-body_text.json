Nsp1 [UNK] exists as a dimer in solution ( 32 ) , PCBPs have been shown to be capable of homo - and heteromultimerization and RNA binding by PCBPs could reflect interaction with single or multiple KH domains ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) . Binding assays with optimized RNA targets generated by in vitro SELEX have revealed that a tandem array of three C - patches maximizes PCBP2 binding to its RNA target ( 45 ) and several established PCBP binding sites contain three or more C - patches ( 33 , 46 ) . However , the sequence motifs implicated in PCBP binding from gene expression analysis of human cells ( 47 , 48 ) and Caenorhabditis elegans ( 49 ) comprise predominantly two adjacent C - rich patches , although it is not known how strongly PCBPs bind to these targets , nor whether any other cellular proteins participate in the interactions . The EMSA data presented here reveal that alone , PCBP1 and PCBP2 bind weakly to the PRRSV C - rich region ( which has two C - patches ) , requiring nsp1 [UNK] for stable binding . Similarly , nsp1 [UNK] binds RNA very weakly , but is evident in complexes ( with PCBPs ) from supershift assays . Stable complex formation on the mRNA thus likely depends upon conformational changes in one or both molecular partners and potentially , direct contact between nsp1 [UNK] and mRNA . In support of the latter , we found that amino acid substitutions in the putative RBM ) of nsp1 [UNK] greatly weakened the association of the complex with RNA , without apparent effect on the interaction with PCBP2 . Yeast two - hybrid studies ( 35 ) have shown that the reciprocal interaction of nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP2 requires the C - terminus of nsp1 [UNK] , including the protease domain ( PLP1 [UNK] ) and Cterminal extension , and the KH2 domain of PCBP2 . In light of this , we hypothesize that the association of nsp1 [UNK] with KH2 would not preclude binding of nsp1 [UNK] to RNA . An alternative interpretation is that nsp1 \u2424 RBM fails to induce a conformational change in PCBPs necessary for stable RNA association .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
