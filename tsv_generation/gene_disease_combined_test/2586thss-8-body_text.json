The general procedures were the same as those for the Ni - NTA columns , although the buffers used in the GST columns were different . PBS solution ( pH 7 . 4 ) was used for equilibration . After the sample was loaded , the same PBS solution was used to wash the column . Finally , the glutathione solution ( 50 mM Tris - HCL , 10 mM reduced glutathione ) was used to elute the protein of interest . All purified recombinant HCV antigens were found to be > 90 % pure based on SDS / polyacrylamide gel analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining . Eluents with high OD 280 were collected into a membrane bag and dialysis was performed overnight at 4 [UNK] C in a buffer ( PBS buffer ) . Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 175}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
