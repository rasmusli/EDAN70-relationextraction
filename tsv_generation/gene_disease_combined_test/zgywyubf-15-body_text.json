Exposure of the same blot to X - ray film revealed the band specific to ORF2 in \u03b2TRCP and ORF2 cotransfected cells ( Figure 4A , lower panel , lane 2 ) . 3 rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the \u03b2TRCP protein , as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti - myc antibody . Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F - box protein , SKP2 . We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 4B , top panel ) . In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments , the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti - myc antibody . Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c - myc protein ( Figure 4B , middle panel ) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein ( Figure 4B transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] - cys / met promix and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody , pre - immune serum ( PS ) or anti - ORF2 antibodies , respectively ; subsequently , samples were immunoblotted with SKP1 and CUL1 antibodies . Same blot was air dried and exposed to X - ray film to check for ORF2 expression by autoradiography .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
