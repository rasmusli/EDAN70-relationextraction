For JEV and some other flaviviruses , oronasal transmission is described , but the mode of infection is unknown . Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells ( NEC ) at the air - liquid interface ( ALI ) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs . Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines , indicating infection and replication in macrophages . Moreover , macrophages stimulated by alarmins , including interleukin - 25 , interleukin - 33 , and thymic stromal lymphopoietin , were more permissive to the JEV infection . Altogether , our data are important to understand the mechanism of nonvector - borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs . IMPORTANCE JEV , a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans , has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito - waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs , which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes , leading to increased human cases . JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors . Moreover , virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium . Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three - dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models , we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus . Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages , which is favored by epithelial - cell - derived cytokines . The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non - vector - borne direct transmission of JEV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 696}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
