These E . coli carry the eae gene encoding a 94 kDa outer membrane protein ( intimin ) which is responsible for intimate attachment to epithelial cells . However , the pathogenic significance of porcine EAE positive isolates in weaned pigs is still unknown [ 2 ] . Furthermore , identification of porcine EPEC is difficult and many veterinary diagnostic laboratories do not routinely screen for this pathotype of E . coli , isolates of which do not usually possess any of virulence factors of classic PWD or oedema strains [ 40 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
