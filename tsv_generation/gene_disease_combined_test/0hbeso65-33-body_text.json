A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides ( PS - ON ) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [ 117 ] . The human liver - chimeric Alb - uPA / SCID mouse model also showed that PS - ON block de novo HCV infection . These data shed light on the promise of PS - ON as future clinical solution .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
