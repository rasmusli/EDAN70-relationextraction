Its large extracellular loop ( LEL ) seems to play a critical role in this interaction process . Moreover , studies have identified several amino acid residues throughout the CD81 LEL and HCV E2 , which might be crucial for E2 - CD81 binding [ 90 , 91 ] . SR - BI , an 82 kDa glycoprotein with a large extracellular loop , is highly expressed in the liver [ 92 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
