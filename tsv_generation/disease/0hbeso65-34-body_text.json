During the past decade , numerous therapeutic approaches based on both basic research and clinical evidences have been reported , but the effective strategy still needs more efforts to be approved . Meanwhile , many critical questions remain in several aspects of HCV , including the viral infection cycle activities , the detailed structure , composition , and function of the HCV virion in host cells . In addition , current standard of therapeutic formula consisting of Pegylated IFN combined with ribavirin and an NS / 4A inhibitor is ineffective or only partially effective . In fact , as reviewed in this paper , many novel inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies targeting HCV proteins and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat HCV . Hopefully , these future strategies will improve the overall outcome of HCV recipients after liver transplantation [ 101 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 632, "end": 646}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 670}, "obj": "ne"}]}
