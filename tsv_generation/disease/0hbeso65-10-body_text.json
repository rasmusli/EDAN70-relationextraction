Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for HCV hepatitis after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [ 7 , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Another study by Gayowski et al . reported in their results that the rate of recurrent HCV hepatitis , timing to recurrence , severity of recurrence and response to IFN therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post - LT HCV hepatitis [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 512}, "obj": "ne"}]}
