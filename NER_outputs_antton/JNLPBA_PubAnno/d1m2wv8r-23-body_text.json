A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 induces apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway 37 . Coincidently , we found that BAK1 was up - regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in this study . BAK is a pro - apoptotic regulator that plays a central role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation 38 . It suppresses tumourigenesis by mediating apoptosis of tumour cells 39 . For example , BAK over - expression can effectively induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells 40 . Also , elevations in BAK protein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine lymphoid , lung cancer , and breast cancer cells 41 . In addition , VDAC2 , which can recruit newly synthesised BAK to the mitochondria to carry out apoptosis 42 , was also up - regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in our study . These findings remind us that the anti - cancer activity of CPV may be closely related to the over - expression of BAK1 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that is mediated by it . Lakshman Santra et al . suggest that CPV2 NS1 might be effective against tumours with the p53 mutation 43 . As a critical effector of apoptosis , BAK can participate in the apoptotic process without activation of p53 . Therefore , over - expression of the bak gene may be a new strategy for the treatment of tumours , especially for tumours bearing p53 mutations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 229}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 289}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 590}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 723, "end": 729}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 767, "end": 771}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 994, "end": 999}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1210, "end": 1214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1277, "end": 1281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1320, "end": 1329}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
