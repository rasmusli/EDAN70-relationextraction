This is also corresponds to the clinical findings where CXCL10 increased in patients with EV71 [ 19 ] . Higher expression of CCL3 observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes ( neutrophils ) during inflammation in the brain . Cytokine storm is thus proposed to cause severe symptoms . Administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] 20 ] . We measured the expression of pro - inflammatory mediators in the tissues of 5746 - infected mice while receiving N3 . Quantitative RT - PCR to the specific cytokines showed that CXCL10 expression was significantly reduced in brainstem , spinal cord , and limb muscle after N3 treatment ( Fig . 7A ) . CCL3 expression was reduced in the brain and limb muscle ( Fig . 7B ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 215}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 282}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 580}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 822}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 841}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 957, "end": 962}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
