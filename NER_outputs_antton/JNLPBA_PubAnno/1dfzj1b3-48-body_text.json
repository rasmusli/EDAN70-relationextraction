However , more recent studies have shown that what occurs is mainly a fast electron transfer from the sample to DPPH radical . The abstraction of hydrogen from the sample by DPPH radical is marginal , because it occurs very slowly and depends on the hydrogen - bond accepting solvent . Methanol and ethanol , solvents generally used for antioxidant ability assays , are strongly hydrogen bond - accepting , therefore the hydrogen - abstracting reaction occurs very slowly [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
