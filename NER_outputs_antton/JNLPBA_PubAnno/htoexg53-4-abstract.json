{"cord_uid": "htoexg53", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6316859", "divid": "4", "text": "At present , there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of MERS - CoV . The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [ 11 ] . Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels [ 12 , 13 ] . These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against MERS - CoV infection and prevention of MERS . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) have listed MERS as priority target for vaccine development [ 14 ] . However , so far , no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I / IIa clinical testing [ 15 ] . One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , a safety - tested and replication - deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer ( for review see [ 16 ] ) . In that context , we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against MERS - CoV . It is well - known that virus - neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein ( S protein ) correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . Since the S protein is present on the cell surface , S protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of MERS - CoV candidate vaccines [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] . However , based on current knowledge from the biology of \u03b2 - coronaviruses , we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus - specific antibodies and T cells . Among those , the nucleocapsid protein ( N protein ) is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . The coronavirus N proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synthesis , the packaging of the viral RNA in helical nucleocapsids , and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] . Furthermore , several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] . Recently , the overexpression of MERS - CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up - regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [ 38 ] . Despite this possible immune modulatory activity , SARS - CoV N - specific immune responses are reported to be long - lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS - CoV S - specific immunity [ 39 ] . Likewise , we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS - CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen . The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS - CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells . From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS - CoV N - specific immunity is based on CD8 + T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens . Currently , there is little information about MERS - CoV N - specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N - specific cellular immunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1270}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1389, "end": 1399}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1432, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1738, "end": 1753}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1778, "end": 1789}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1804, "end": 1832}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1864, "end": 1885}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1887, "end": 1897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2058, "end": 2081}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 2178, "end": 2188}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 2221, "end": 2231}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 2234, "end": 2256}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
