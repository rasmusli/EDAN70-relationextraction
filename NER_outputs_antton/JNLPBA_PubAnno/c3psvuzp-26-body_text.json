{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "26", "text": "This ' defense ' model to explain macro - PARP evolution , combined with the importance of virally encoded macrodomains for the fitness of several RNA viruses , allows us to generate a mechanistic hypothesis for the conflict that may have driven the rapid evolution of macro - PARP genes . In our model , ADP - ribosylation functions as a post - translational modification of either host or viral factors ( Figure 5A ) . We posit that macro - PARP proteins are recruited to sites of ADP - ribosylation by their macrodomains , most of which are predicted to be able to recognize , but not remove ADP - ribose ( Figure S5 ) , to exert either direct antiviral functions or recruit other antiviral factors . Recruitment of catalytically active macro - PARP genes could also facilitate further ADP - ribosylation of target proteins , allowing macro - PARP proteins to rapidly ' amplify ' an initial signal of ADPr . Such a model of amplification by recruitment and additional ADP - ribosylation by PARP proteins has been seen at sites of DNA damage , where PARP1 activation by ADPr leads to increased ADP - ribosylation [ 7 , 8 ] . We hypothesize that some viruses have overcome this macro - PARP - mediated antiviral response by direct antagonism of macro - PARP proteins ( Figure 5B ) . Such antagonism could drive the rapid evolution we see in several regions of the macro - PARP genes , including but not limited to the macrodomains . However , other viruses , such as togaviruses and coronaviruses , have evolved their own macrodomains to either cleave ADP - ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with macro - PARP proteins ( Figure 5D ) , in order to overcome the effects of the macro - PARP proteins . Although speculative , our model provides testable hypotheses about the genetic and physical interactions between PARP macrodomains , viral macrodomains , and ADP - ribose , and their consequences in terms of determining outcomes of viral infections in cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 47}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 457}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 511, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 684, "end": 702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 838, "end": 860}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1052, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1179, "end": 1192}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1270, "end": 1280}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1365, "end": 1384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1523, "end": 1536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1596, "end": 1618}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1620, "end": 1630}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1674, "end": 1696}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1812, "end": 1830}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1832, "end": 1851}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
