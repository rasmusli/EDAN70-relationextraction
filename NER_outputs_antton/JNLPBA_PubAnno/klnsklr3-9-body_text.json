Conventional DC ' s can also produce high amounts of IFNa if they are directly infected , but pDC ' s are uniquely able to secrete high levels of IFNa in response to endocytosed antigen . The role of pDC ' s in production of IFNa during LDV infection was investigated by depleting mice of pDC ' s the day before LDV infection using a pDC - specific depleting antibody [ 26 ] . The plasma IFNa response at 16 hours postinfection with LDV , as measured by ELISA , was abolished by pDC depletion ( Figure 3A ) . Thus the systemic IFNa response was predominantly due to production by pDC ' s . In addition to loss of the IFNa response in pDC - depleted mice , we also observed the failure of splenic lymphocytes to upregulate CD69 . A histogram showing CD69 expression on splenocytes from a representative mouse is shown in Figure 3B . Combined with the dependence on IFNafor upregulation of CD69 on B cells in vitro , the data indicate ( B ) Upregulation of CD69 on major splenic lymphocyte subsets at 16hpi with LDV was analyzed by co - staining with antibodies for CD69 and either CD4 , CD8 or CD19 as indicated . The difference in percentage of CD69 hi cells between na\u00efve and infected mice was statistically significant for all subsets by t test , P = 0 . 0225 for CD4 + T cells , 0 . 003 for CD8 + T cells , and 0 . 0018 for CD19 + B cells ( n = 2 mice per na\u00efve group and 3 mice per infected group . ) ( C ) Tissue distribution of CD69 upregulation . Lymphocytes from spleen , blood , lymph nodes , bone marrow , and thymus were examined at 16hpi with LDV . All tissues except the thymus showed a significantly higher percentage of CD69 hi lymphocytes when infected with LDV infected ( P , 0 . 01 for all groups indicated by * ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0006105 . g001 that in vivo upregulation of CD69 on lymphocytes is likely due to the systemic IFNa response to LDV infection . Interestingly , the loss of the IFNa response in pDC - depleted mice produced no statistically significant difference in LDV plasma levels as measured by real time PCR ( 15 ) ( Figure 3C ) . Since IFNa can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to limit virus replication and spread [ 27 ] , it appears that LDV is quite resistant to the antiviral effects of IFNa , even when present at very high systemic levels .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 35}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 341}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 511, "end": 516}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 551}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 590, "end": 595}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 699, "end": 733}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 987}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1114, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1229, "end": 1237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1253, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1320, "end": 1325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1414, "end": 1425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1429, "end": 1434}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1445, "end": 1449}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1451, "end": 1455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1458, "end": 1463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1510, "end": 1515}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1799, "end": 1804}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
