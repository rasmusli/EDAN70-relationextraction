A comparison of actual and expected dinucleotide frequencies of the 16 dinucleotides in coding region of the 48 polioviruses genomes was also undertaken . The odds ratio r xy = \u0192 xy / \u0192 y \u0192 x , where \u0192 x denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X , \u0192 y denotes the frequency of the nucleotide Y , \u0192 y \u0192 x the expected frequency of the dinucleotide XY and \u0192 xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY , etc . , for each dinucleotide were calculated . As a conservative criterion , for r xy > 1 . 23 ( or < 0 . 78 ) , the XY pair is considered to be of over - represented ( or under - represented ) relative abundance compared with a random association of mononucleotides .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 872}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
