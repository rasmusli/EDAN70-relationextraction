An estimated 226 , 160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone , and 160 , 340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [ 1 ] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer . Protein levels of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , a mediator of inflammation , were reported elevated in several cancer types , including colorectal , prostate , and lung cancers , and suppression of either COX - 2 expression or COX - 2 activation , is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [ 2 ] . Of the five prostaglandins ( PG ) produced by COX - 2 , PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation , invasion , angiogenesis , and immunosuppression [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1 - 4 . These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [ 6 , 7 ] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 438}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 629}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 758}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 973}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
