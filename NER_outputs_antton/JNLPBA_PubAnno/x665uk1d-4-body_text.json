{"cord_uid": "x665uk1d", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4072776", "divid": "4", "text": "A scFv is a recombinant antibody fragment , which commonly consists of a full variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain covalently linked to the corresponding variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain . scFvs have multiple benefits over traditional monoclonal antibodies due to their greatly reduced size , ease of genetic manipulation , and production of antibodies against viral proteins [ 14 ] . In 1994 , scFv which binds to the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) regulatory protein Rev was expressed intracellularly and potently inhibited HIV - 1 replication in scFv immunized cells [ 15 ] . In addition , scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [ 16 , 17 ] . The retroviral capsid protein can be used as an antiviral target and thereby extend the number of targets that can potentially be used in combined scFvbased gene therapy approaches [ 18 ] . However , despite the many virus resistant studies using scFv proteins , no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses . Montandon et al . ( 1982 ) showed antiviral effects against Moloney murine leukemia virus ( M - MuLV ) with DNase I . In another study , DNase I digested DNA in the form of unmethylated proviral M - MuLV selectively [ 19 ] . Exonuclease , ISG20 , which is induced by type 1 interferon ( IFN ) , was over - expressed in CEL cells to inhibit HIV replication through nuclease activity [ 20 , 21 ] . Another case was reported in a plant system using Pac1 , an RNase isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Challenging a transgenic potato that expresses Pac1 with potato spindle tuber viroid ( PSTVd ) resulted in suppression of PSTVd infection and accumulation without significant undesired effects on the plant . The anti - viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNAhydrolyzing activity [ 22 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 2, "end": 7}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 215}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 223}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 404}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 428}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 633, "end": 638}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 660}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 686}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 783}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1254, "end": 1262}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1342, "end": 1354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1356, "end": 1362}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1384, "end": 1402}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1404, "end": 1408}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1481, "end": 1490}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1563, "end": 1568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1573, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1873, "end": 1880}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
