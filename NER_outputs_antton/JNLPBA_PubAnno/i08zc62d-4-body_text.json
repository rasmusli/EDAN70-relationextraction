The need to combat these superbugs mandates the development of new drugs overcoming antibacterial resistance . Various pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae express sialidases . These enzymes specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates ( Shinya et al . , 2006 ) and play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of a number of microbial diseases , including cholera , enterotoxaemia , gas gangrene and pneumonia ( Corfield , 1992 ; Rood , 1998 ) . Therefore , bacterial sialidases have recently emerged as a prominent target for the treatment of bacterial infections ( Nguyen et al . , 2010 ; Woo et al . , 2011 ) . The latest studies on sequelae of sepsis and septic shock have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial pathogenic factors ( Rittirsch et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , studies using a sialidase deletion mutant from P . aeruginosa showed that bacterial sialidase acts in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting glycoconjugates and biofilm production ( Soong et al . , 2006 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 946, "end": 965}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1033}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1081, "end": 1101}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
