{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "29", "text": "Not all PCBPs were capable of stimulating PRF . The lack of activity of PCBP4 and hnRNP K / J is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization . PCBP1 , 2 and 3 are globally similar , with KH domains located at analogous positions in the protein , whereas the linker separating KH2 and KH3 is shorter in PCBP4 and much longer in hnRNP K / J ( Figure 3D ) . These differences did not affect association of PCPB4 with nsp1 [UNK] , but could affect the strength of binding of individual KH domains to RNA or alternatively , preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the mRNA . With the KH domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2 , we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding , ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce PRF . However , we saw differential activity in PRF of the KH1 domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2 , with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting \u2212 1 PRF , but with reduced \u2212 2 PRF . When RNA association was examined by EMSA , PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m bound to the PRRSV RNA with similar affinity and in an nsp1 [UNK] - dependent manner , although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the WT proteins . This suggests that PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m still associate with the RNA , but the stability , conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the case of PCBP2 KH1m is PRF possible , and only \u2212 1 PRF ( which is the predominant frameshift event for WT PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance ) . As noted in the ' Results ' section , compensatory activity in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually inactive PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP1 KH3m , suggesting that two ( or more ) PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting . The differential activity of PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo - oligomerize .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 78}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 94}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 196}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 345}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 446}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 530}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 634}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 663}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 672}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 676, "end": 682}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 808, "end": 812}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 860}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 886}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 899, "end": 905}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1019}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1076}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1091}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1104, "end": 1114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1146, "end": 1151}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1272, "end": 1283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1287, "end": 1298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1434, "end": 1445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1448, "end": 1452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1476, "end": 1480}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1537}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1640}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1691, "end": 1702}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1706, "end": 1717}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T38", "span": {"begin": 1751, "end": 1757}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T39", "span": {"begin": 1829, "end": 1840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T40", "span": {"begin": 1844, "end": 1855}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
