We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression . These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO . Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity . We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ) , protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 \u00b5M . These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 75}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 160}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 187}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 194}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 216}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 475, "end": 478}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 499}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 741}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 831}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
