However , the higher pathogenicity of MERS - CoV was apparent by the higher number of deaths caused by this virus . Similar to the virus of SARS , MERS - CoV infects and replicates in the human airway epithelial cells and suppresses the production of interferons [ 31 , 32 ] . However , unlike SARS - CoV , the MERS virus exhibits wider tissue tropism [ 33 , 34 ] . MERS - CoV can also induce pro - inflammatory cytokines but lacks in production of innate antiviral cytokines compared with SARS - CoV . Suggesting MERS - CoV induces delayed pro - inflammatory response and attenuates innate immunity , which suggests that MERS - CoV is more lethal compared with SARS - CoV [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] . Primarily the MERS virus interacts with the host DPP4 receptor through its spike ( S ) protein after entering the respiratory tract . DPP4 receptors are present on the epithelial surface of various human organs such as , the lungs , kidneys , liver , bone marrow , thymus and intestines [ 38 ] . The systemic distribution of DPP4 facilitates the dissemination of virus in the human body . Expression of DPP4 on the respiratory tract is mainly on type I and type II pneumocytes , endothelial cells , nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells and a few forms of hematopoietic cells [ 39 , 40 ] . The abundance of the receptor DPP4 is greater on the epithelial cells lining the lower airways and alveoli and lesser on the epithelial surface of upper conducting airways and nasal cavity [ 41 ] . Recent findings have suggested that a prior existing pulmonary ailment might increase the chances of such individuals contracting MERS , as chronic pulmonary diseases results in enhanced DPP4 expression [ 40 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 490, "end": 519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 573}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 842, "end": 856}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 888}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 927, "end": 942}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1201}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1414, "end": 1419}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1774}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
