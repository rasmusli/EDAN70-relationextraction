Nododazole induced obvious G2 / M arrest ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 1J ) . At 2 h post - infection , there was no significant difference in the genomic RNA level in the control and G2 / M phase - synchronized cells ( Figure 1M ) ; however , at 24 h post - infection the genomic level was lower in the synchronized cells than in the control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ; Figure 1K ) . Furthermore , at 24 h post - infection the TCID50 / mL for supernatant from the G2 / M phase - synchronized cells ( 0 . 46 \u00b1 0 . 29 \u00d7 10 5 ) was obviously lower than that from the control cells ( 1 . 40 \u00b1 0 . 16 \u00d7 10 5 ) ( P < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1L ) . Therefore , these results suggest that G2 / M synchronization does not affect viral entry , but inhibits EV - D68 viral replication and production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 469}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
