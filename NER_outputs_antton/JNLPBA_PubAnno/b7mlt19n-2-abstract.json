Autophagy can serve as an antiviral defense mechanism but also as a proviral process during infection . Atg8 - family proteins play a central role in the autophagy process due to their ability to interact with components of the autophagy machinery as well as selective autophagy receptors and adaptor proteins . Such interactions are usually mediated through LC3 - interacting region ( LIR ) motifs . So far , only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional LIR motif , leaving open a vast field for investigation . Here , we have developed the iLIR @ viral database ( http : / / ilir . uk / virus / ) as a freely accessible web resource listing all the putative canonical LIR motifs identified in viral proteins . Additionally , we used a curated text - mining analysis of the literature to identify novel putative LIR motif - containing proteins ( LIRCPs ) in viruses . We anticipate that iLIR @ viral will assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 347}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 509}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 530}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 579, "end": 619}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 714}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 930}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 944, "end": 959}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1094}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1209}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
