However , the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines had 3 , 270 and 3 , 174 times more 3D8 scFv in the brain than that of the F 0 69 line , even 201 . 98 times more in F 0 110 . Therefore , the F 0 69 line was used as a control and the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after PRV infection ( Figure 7A ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 309}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
