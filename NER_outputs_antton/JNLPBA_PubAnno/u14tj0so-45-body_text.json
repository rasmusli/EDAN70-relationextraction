The input structure G has a high energy value and neither method 1 ( HFold ) nor method 2 ( HFold - PKonly ) can expand the pseudoknot - free structure to add the pseudoknotted stem . Also , by adding too many pseudoknot - free base pairs , method 3 fails to find the pseudoknotted base pairs . Thus , method 4 performs better than methods 1 , 2 and 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 260}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 317}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
