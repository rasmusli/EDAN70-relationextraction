Following their tat - mediated cellular uptake into primary lymphocytes and macrophages , these inhibitory heptapeptides , expressed in fusion with stabilizing proteins , successfully suppressed HIV - 1 replication , although at a concentration higher than those of currently used antiviral drugs . Along with a better design of the peptide ligand , conjugation to other CPPs may improve cellular uptake and therefore antiviral activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 121}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 147}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 177}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 326}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 533}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
