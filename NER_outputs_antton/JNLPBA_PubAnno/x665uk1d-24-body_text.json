The pcDNA3 . 1 - 3D8 scFv plasmid was linearized with NruI / StuI / PvuI enzymes and then used for transformation of C57BL / 6NCrjBgi . A total of 150 F 0 were generated and 10 lines ( F 0 : 47 , 69 , 90 , 92 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 115 , 128 , and 135 ) out of 150 F 0 were selected by PCR analysis ( Figure S3A ) . Each transformant was reconfirmed by Southern hybridization after genomic DNA was digested by EcoRI and HindIII enzymes . All transformants showed single bands that reacted with the probes prepared with the 3D8 scFv full gene ( Figure S3B ) . 3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed in the different transgenic lines and different organs . The muscle , brain , and liver were chosen because these organs are virus infection routes and the relative 3D8 scFv gene expression levels were investigated by quantitative real - time RT - PCR ( Figure 7A ) . The F 0 69 , 90 , and 135 lines were selected from 10 F 0 lines for further analysis based on 3D8 scFv expression levels in the TG mice lines and previous therapeutics experiments , which showed that PRV was detected in muscle and brains after mice were challenged with PRV and 3D8 scFv proteins by intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections , respectively . Therefore , the F 0 90 line , which expressed the highest 3D8 scFv levels in both brain Wild - type HeLa , SCH07072 , and muSCH cells were infected with HSV : : GFV at an MOI of 0 . 5 and then incubated for 2 , 6 . 5 , and 25 hr in the presence or absence of PAA 1 hr after virus challenge . ICP4 was used for the immediate early stage , UL9 for the early stage , and UL19 for the late stage of viral infection . Data bars show mean 6 standard error . * * and * * * indicate significant differences from HSV - 1 viral DNA at p , 0 . 01 and p , 0 . 001 , respectively ( one - way analysis of variance and Tukey ' s post hoc t - test ) . C . Quantitative real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was used to measure the expression of immediate early genes ( ICP0 and ICP4 ) , early genes ( UL9 and UL29 ) , and late genes ( UL19 and UL38 ) . The relative concentrations of HSV mRNAs were calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta C T method . Data bars represent mean 6 standard error . * , * * , * * * indicate significant differences from HeLa cells at p , 0 . 05 , p , 0 . 01 , and p , 0 . 001 , respectively ( one - way analysis of variance and Tukey ' s post hoc t - test and muscle , and the F 0 135 line , which expressed high amounts of 3D8 scFv in the brain , were selected and used for further investigations on the antiviral preventive effects . The F 0 69 line showed positive gPCR and RT - PCR results but 3D8 scFv expression levels in the F 0 69 line were low ; thus , it was used as a control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 52}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 127}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 632}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 727, "end": 746}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 759}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 772}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 983}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1175}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1350, "end": 1368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1491, "end": 1500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1725, "end": 1730}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
