[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] However , the number of FPLV strains isolated from the adaptive carnivore species and the molecular information associated with these isolates are very limited . Clinical and etiological investigations are very important for discovering the mechanism ( s ) underlying the genetic evolution and pathogenicity of FPLV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
