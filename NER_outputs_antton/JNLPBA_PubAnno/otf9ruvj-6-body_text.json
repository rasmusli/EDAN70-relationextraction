Sepsis , bacterial pneumonia , polytrauma , and aspiration pneumonia are the most common causes of ARDS [ 1 ] . Predictors of survival include age , the type of underlying medical condition , the severity of pulmonary injury , the presence of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction , and ongoing sepsis [ 2 ] . Currently , clinical attempts to rescue ARDS patients include individualized ventilation and fluid management , adequate infection control , including early application of broad - spectrum anti - infectives , neuromuscular blockade using cisatracurium , sedation strategies , prone positioning , and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) to ensure oxygenation [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Although the incidence of ARDS is relatively high , with five to eight cases per 100 , 000 European inhabitants and even more in the USA , the various pathomechanisms are only partially understood , resulting in different experimental approaches to understand immune responses during early ARDS [ 6 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
