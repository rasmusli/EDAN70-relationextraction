{"cord_uid": "mm83ml06", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5580479", "divid": "2", "text": "In recent years it has been well established that two major constituent parts of the ubiquitin proteasome system ( UPS ) - the proteasome holoenzymes and a number of ubiquitin ligases - play a crucial role , not only in virus replication but also in the regulation of the immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) . However , the role in HIV - 1 replication of the third major component , the deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) , has remained largely unknown . In this study , we show that the DUB - inhibitors ( DIs ) P22077 and PR - 619 , specific for the DUBs USP7 and USP47 , impair Gag processing and thereby reduce the infectivity of released virions without affecting viral protease activity . Furthermore , the replication capacity of X4 - and R5 - tropic HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 in human lymphatic tissue is decreased upon treatment with these inhibitors without affecting cell viability . Most strikingly , combinatory treatment with DIs and proteasome inhibitors synergistically blocks virus replication at concentrations where mono - treatment was ineffective , indicating that DIs can boost the therapeutic effect of proteasome inhibitors . In addition , P22077 and PR - 619 increase the polyubiquitination of Gag and thus its entry into the UPS and the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) - I pathway . In summary , our data point towards a model in which specific inhibitors of DUBs not only interfere with virus spread but also increase the immune recognition of HIV - 1 expressing cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 106}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 150}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 449}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 601}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 614}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 704, "end": 713}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1194, "end": 1203}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1282, "end": 1325}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1413, "end": 1418}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
