Many antiviral drug studies have been based on a functional analysis of viral genes and an understanding of the virus life cycle . McFarland and Hill ( 1987 ) showed successful vaccination of mice and pigs with a mutant PRV thymidine kinase [ 4 ] . Qing Ge also demonstrated that nucleocapsid siRNA or a component of the RNA transcriptase ( PA ) is a good antiviral drug to protect against influenza virus by inhibiting viral RNA transcription with siRNAs [ 5 ] . In addition , acyclovir , which is the best antiviral agent against HSV - 1 , is a nucleotide analogue that shows an antiviral effect by inhibiting DNA replication [ 6 ] . However , commercially - developed antiviral drugs such as viral DNA polymerases , viral reverse transcriptases , and neuraminidase inhibitors target one or two viruses [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . Thus , a new strategy is needed to prepare for outbreaks caused by new viruses or new mutant viruses because of the high mutation rates of viral genomes and recombination events among closely - related viruses [ 12 , 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 615}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 706}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 732}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 993}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 1024}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1030, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1260}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
