{"cord_uid": "zgywyubf", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3506457", "divid": "11", "text": "I\u03baB\u03b1 was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes ( Figure 2A ) . Notably , the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the end of the labeling period ( 0 minute chase ) in IKK\u03b2 alone expressing cells were less than that in IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 coexpressing cells , indicating that I\u03baB\u03b1 is a very labile protein in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells . The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100 % . To further confirm whether I\u03baB\u03b1 stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF - \u03baB in ORF2 expressing cells , nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti - p65 antibody . As seen in Figure 2B , ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 2 and 4 ; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below ) . As expected , mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 1 and 3 ) . This is attributed to the fact that basal NF - \u03baB activity is higher in Huh7 cells [ 13 ] . In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls , equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti - calnexin and anti - phospho c - Jun antibodies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 270}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 391, "end": 396}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 586}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 755, "end": 775}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 853, "end": 865}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1091, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1200, "end": 1208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1437, "end": 1453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1457, "end": 1491}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
