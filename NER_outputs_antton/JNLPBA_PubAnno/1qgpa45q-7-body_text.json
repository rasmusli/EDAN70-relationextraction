The increased number of phylogenetically informative variant sites obtained from full genomes may allow better linking of cases and aid public health interventions in real time during epidemics [ 14 , 15 ] . PCR approaches for targeted whole genome sequencing , in contrast to random amplification , can preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental nucleic acids [ 16 , 17 ] potentially focusing sequencing on the virus of interest . To date , the largest dataset of HMPV whole genomes ( n = 61 ) sequenced from any tropical country is from three Peruvian cities , Lima , Piura and Iquitos [ 18 ] . In Africa , apart from one metapneumovirus genome identified from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda ( GenBank accession number HM197719 ) , there are no HMPV genomes reported according to the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource ( ViPR , http : / / www . viprbrc . org / , accessed April 30 , 2019 ) . This has led to limited understanding of the genetic and genomic diversity of HMPV in the continent .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 196, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 310}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 337}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 891, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1030}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
