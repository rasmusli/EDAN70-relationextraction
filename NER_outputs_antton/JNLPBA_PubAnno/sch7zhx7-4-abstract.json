We isolated two distinct viral mutants in the 2A and 3C proteases . We determined that these mutant viruses were resistant to polyamine depletion and that these mutations conferred no fitness advantage in the absence of polyamine depletion . To investigate the proteolytic activity of these enzymes , we developed a protease - dependent split - luciferase reporter system to measure 2A and 3C activity . Using this assay , we observed that 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion , to which mutant 2A and 3C proteases were resistant . Additionally , we observed that viruses containing these mutants were able to cleave cellular targets efficiently in polyamine - depleted cells . Together , these data suggest that polyamines are crucial for viral protease activity and that we may target CVB3 proteolytic activity through polyamine - depleting pharmaceuticals like DFMO .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 211}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 682}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 913, "end": 922}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
