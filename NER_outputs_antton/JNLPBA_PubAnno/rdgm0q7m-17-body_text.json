{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "17", "text": "To assess the role in PRF of sequences 3 of the slippery sequence , a series of in - frame deletions were introduced into pDluc / PRRSV , starting from the 3 end of the inserted PRRSV sequence . RNAs transcribed from these plasmids were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1 [UNK] ( Figure 2A ) . PRF was found to be unaffected until the length of the PRRSV sequence downstream of the slippery sequence fell below 21 nt , at which point PRF was reduced ( 18 nt ) or abolished ( 15 or 9 nt ) . In the latter constructs , the C - rich region is compromised , consistent with an important role in PRF . Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells ( Li et al . , ( 19 ) ) . To investigate the function of the C - rich region specifically , we prepared a library of individual point mutations within , and flanking , the Crich region and assessed their effect on PRF ( Figure 2B ) . It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effect on PRF , with the exception of the final residue ( C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence ) , where the effect was more modest . As an explanation for these observations , we speculated that the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence may interact with PCBPs . The ' minimal ' region of PRRSV RNA required for full activity in PRF ( 21 nt ) has only two C - rich patches , whereas previously established PCBP - binding consensus sequences more commonly have three ( or more ) C - triplets , potentially with each triplet binding one KH domain ( ( 33 ) ; see below ) . However , PCBP1 and PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate with GST - tagged nsp1 [UNK] in association screens , and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown ( 34 , 35 ) . PCBPs could therefore bind to the PRRSV mRNA by virtue of an association with nsp1 [UNK] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 26}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 66}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 193}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 255}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 371}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 445}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 544}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 602}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 752}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 847, "end": 860}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 893}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 995}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1201, "end": 1219}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1268}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1311, "end": 1315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1317, "end": 1323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1338, "end": 1355}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1388, "end": 1423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1460, "end": 1473}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1517, "end": 1527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1562, "end": 1568}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1572, "end": 1578}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1660}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1764, "end": 1770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1798, "end": 1809}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1842, "end": 1853}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
