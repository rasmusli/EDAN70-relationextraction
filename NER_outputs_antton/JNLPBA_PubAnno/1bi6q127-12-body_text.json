The answer to this has been linked to the evolution of the ability to fly . The increased rate of metabolism accompanying flight would lead to higher levels of oxygen - free radicals [ 32 , 33 ] . This makes bats more prone to generating damaged DNA [ 34 ] . As mounting an immune response is energetically expensive [ 35 ] and would be detrimental , bats probably evolved mechanisms to suppress activation of immune response due to damaged DNA generated via flight , thereby leading to reduced inflammation . This would also explain why bats of certain species live longer than expected given their high metabolism and small size [ 36 ] . In bats the evolutionary suppression of inflammation and consequent susceptibility to virus infection is counteracted by constitutive expression of innate immune genes or novel genes to target viruses as described earlier . This model has been depicted in in Figure 1 . Development of flight necessitated the evolution of bats with the ability to modulate the consequences of increased metabolic activity by suppressing inflammation ( left ) . Inflammation was suppressed by dampening the activation of DNA sensors , such as STING , and reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines , such as TNF\u03b1 ( center ) . These traits were positively selected but a reduced inflammatory response made it advantageous for virus replication ( lower right ) . Increased susceptibility of cells to virus replication was compensated by selection of more effective antiviral measures , such as higher constitutive expression of Interferons or unique ISG expressions ( upper right ) .
