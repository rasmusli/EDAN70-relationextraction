Although ORF2 is an N - linked glycoprotein , which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum , recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro - translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm , where it is detected as a non - glycosylated protein . Importantly , in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates , retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm [ 16 ] . Thus , cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with \u03b2TRCP . Indeed , experiments done using \u039435 ORF2 protein suggest that non - glycosylated , cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with \u03b2TRCP and inhibiting NF - \u03baB activity . Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 50}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 594}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 670, "end": 683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 719}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 770}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 874}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 897}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
