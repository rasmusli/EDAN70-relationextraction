An array of antiviral sialidase agents have been developed and are commercially available , such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating influenza . However , the development of bacterial sialidase inhibitors has been much less successful . Here , natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp - NanI , a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens , are reported . This bacterium causes various gastrointestinal diseases . The crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain in complex with the best inhibitor , diplacone , is also presented . This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme - inhibitor complex . These results provide a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural flavonoids , which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti - sialidase agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 10}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 271}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 583, "end": 593}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 607}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 767}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 893, "end": 920}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1019}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1106, "end": 1116}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
