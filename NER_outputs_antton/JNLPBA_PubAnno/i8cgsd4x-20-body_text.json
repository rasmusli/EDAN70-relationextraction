As a control cells were transfected with dsRNA against GFP . Cell lysates were collected 48 hours post - transfection . Western blot was performed using anti - CxSTAT antibody . The results showed decreased STAT levels in cells transfected with WNV - NS1 or WNV - NS5 ( Fig 5D ) . The levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . In WNV - NS3 transfected cells , there was no significant change in STAT level . These results indicate that WNV infection of Culex cells leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 , activated by WNV NS1 and NS5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 70}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 101}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 156}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 370}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 516, "end": 523}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 598}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 694}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 705}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 736}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
