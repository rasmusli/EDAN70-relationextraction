{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "26", "text": "To identify the genomic intervals harboring genes that mediated variable expression , we performed genome - wide interval mapping and marker regression analyses for each transcript . The expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between BXD strains ( Table 2 ) . All transcripts except one ( Sln , sarcolipin ) had either a suggestive ( LRS . 10 . 4 ) or significant ( LRS . 17 ) eQTL that mapped to the hotspot regions on Chr1 and Chr2 identified in the cluster map ( Table 2 ) . One transcript , Myh6 ( myosin heavy chain 6 , Chr14 ) , varied by 2 . 62 - fold between the highest and lowest expressing BXD strains ( Figure 2B ) , such that a significant trans eQTL could be mapped to Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb ( Figure 2C ) . Of the remaining transcripts , 11 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb region ( Table 2 ) . Two additional transcripts had significant eQTL mapping to Chr1 ( Doc2g , Chr19 ; Trnd , Chr10 ) but these did not overlap and were not replicated in more than one other transcript ( Table 2 ) . Two transcripts , Kcnj3 and Tnni3 ( Chr2 and Chr7 , respectively ) , had overlapping significant eQTL on Chr2 . For example , Tnni3 expression varied by 2 . 35fold between strains ( Figure 2D ) and a trans eQTL was mapped to Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb ( Figure 2E ) . Of the remaining transcripts , 12 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb region ( Table 2 ) . A second eQTL peak on Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb also reached significance for one gene ( Mybpc3 , Chr2 ) and was a suggestive eQTL for seven additional transcripts ( Table 2 ) . Using the Tnni3 eQTL plot as an example , this Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb region had a suggestive LRS ( Figure 2F ) . Since three significant eQTL intervals ( Chr1 : 33 6 1 Mb , Chr2 : 68 . 8 6 0 . 4 Mb , and Chr2 : 77 . 5 6 1 Mb ) were mapped with suggestive LRS in multiple pulmonary myocardium transcripts , the genes within these regions were interrogated to identify putative upstream regulatory genes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 453}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 462}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 551}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 553, "end": 559}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 711, "end": 716}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 821, "end": 845}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 923}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 931}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 939}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 946}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 948, "end": 954}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1082, "end": 1088}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1090, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1099, "end": 1104}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1180, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1279, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1397, "end": 1417}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1527, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1536, "end": 1541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1564, "end": 1569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1590, "end": 1602}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1626, "end": 1632}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1663, "end": 1691}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1774}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1788, "end": 1798}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
