{"cord_uid": "0pmo3opx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5431086", "divid": "19", "text": "The active site of APN is expansive with openings on three sides allowing for the accommodation of large peptide substrates . Its exclusive mono - aminopeptidase activity is the direct result of hydrogen bonds formed between active site residues Gln208 , Glu350 and Glu406 with the N - terminal amine group of the peptide substrate . Di - aminopeptidase activity is not observed because favorable hydrogen bonds cannot be made to anchor the peptide in the proper orientation for bond hydrolysis . The importance of these hydrogen bonds in peptide binding was also evident in our inhibitor study in which the N - termini of HSPW peptides were capped with different groups . By removing one or more potential hydrogen bonds from the N - terminus , the capped peptides were unable to bind , resulting in poor inhibition . In addition to these P1 residues , our global analysis revealed previously uncharacterized prime - side specificity features that were dictated by hydrophobic interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding with main chain groups . These important interactions were evident when the HSPW core sequence of our lead inhibitor was truncated . The removal of Trp5 or both Pro4 and Trp5 abrogated the ability of the peptide to inhibit APN . The critical interactions these two residues make with the active site were observed in our modelling experiment documenting that both residues form VDW interactions with Y472 . The end result of our study was a cyclic peptide , cyc - LHSPW that was a potent and specific inhibitor of APN . By inhibiting the enzymatic activity of APN , we found that cyc - LHSPW was therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo in a model of highly aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer . With this aggressive form of cancer on the rise , it is highly plausible the future treatments for neuroendocrine prostate cancer could involve targeting APN 30 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 16}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 23}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 354}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 620}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 731, "end": 744}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 843}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1099, "end": 1118}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1171, "end": 1176}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1193, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1311, "end": 1323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1537, "end": 1541}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1583, "end": 1587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1876, "end": 1883}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
