Mice were given 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post 1610 5 pfu of 5746 infection . The antibody - treated animals were sacrificed and tissue sections were prepared on Day 4 after infection . No marked lesions or inflammation were observed in the brain , spinal cord , skin , heart , spleen , lungs , or liver ( data not shown ) of infected mice received N3 treatment . In immunochemistry staining with anti - EV71 antibody , viral particles did not accumulated in the brainstem ( Fig . 5A ) and muscles ( Fig . 5B ) of mice treated with N3 , in contrast to the marked accumulation in the these tissue of mice which did not receive treatment or received only isotype antibody . The muscle fibers were damaged in the non - treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3 , compared to the section of normal muscle tissue ( MOCK ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Our previous study had showed that microvilli in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [ 11 ] . To investigate whether the EV71 - induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not , histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed . The result showed that the intestine from the mice received N3 was no damage , compared to massive destruction of the mucosa and microvilli in antibody - untreated or isotype antibody - treated mice ( Fig . 5C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 166}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 528, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 784, "end": 801}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 895}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1067, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1521, "end": 1532}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
