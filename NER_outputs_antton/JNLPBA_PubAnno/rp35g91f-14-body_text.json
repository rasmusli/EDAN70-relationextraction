We performed sample correlation in the BXD data set and returned the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts ( Supplemental Material , Table S1 in File S2 ; P , 0 . 0005 ) . This set of 100 transcripts was enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function , including structural proteins ( actin and myosin ) , ion transporters ( ryanodine receptors , calcium , and potassium transporters ) , and transcription factors ( Hand2 and Nkx2 - 5 ) . To define genes within this list that were likely to act in a concerted manner in the pulmonary myocardium , we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation . 0 . 8 . These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed with lower stringency to visualize potential relationships between them ( Figure 1A ) . Three transcripts ( Tnnt2 , Pln , and Kcnj3 ) were detected by two separate probes and thus the 24 transcripts corresponded to only 21 unique genes . All 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle ( Chopra and Knollmann 2013 ; Ding et al . 2010 ; Fukuda and Mikoshiba 2000 ; Greulich et al . 2011 ; Guo et al . 2013 ; Hennessey et al . 2013 ; Holmegard et al . 2010 ; Huh et al . 2012 ; Marx et al . 2000 ; Reiser et al . 2001 ; Sequeira et al . 2015 ; Shaikh et al . 2016 ; Stobdan et al . 2015 ; Takeda et al . 2003 ; Warren et al . 2012 ; Yamashita et al . 2003 ; Zhou and Wu 2014 ) ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ) ; all were highly significantly correlated with Tnni3 ( P , 3 . 02e 28 ) . These genes can be loosely clustered into functional categories including structural sarcomeric proteins , regulation of sarcomere assembly , ion transport , transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation , and hormone signaling ( Table 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 397}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 405}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 459}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 498}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 528}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 929, "end": 941}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 943, "end": 949}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 951, "end": 955}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 961, "end": 967}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1065, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1613, "end": 1619}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1714, "end": 1745}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1761, "end": 1771}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
