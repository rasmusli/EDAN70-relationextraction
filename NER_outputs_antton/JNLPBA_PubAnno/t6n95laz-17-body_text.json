It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis , angiogenesis and T - cell function , which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome ( 18 ) . Changes in platelet morphology , with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction , may occur in chronic liver diseases , and thrombocytes are activated in chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis . Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with liver cirrhosis has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls ( 19 ) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis . In the present study , levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure . This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 641}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 747, "end": 775}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 953}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
