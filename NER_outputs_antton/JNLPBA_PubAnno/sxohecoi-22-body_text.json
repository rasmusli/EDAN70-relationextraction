This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues [ 34 , 35 , 43 ] . Mice expressing human FcRn in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver IgG to the luminal intestinal surface , which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the immune complex back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4 + T cells [ 34 ] . In addition , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti - CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages [ 35 ] . Under these conditions , the virus did not replicate . However , in explants from CMV - seropositive women with low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies , virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact , uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer . Thus , it appeared that neutralizing antibody inhibited infection after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer . On the other hand , non - neutralizing antibody allowed or even promoted infection . Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn , and when FcRn on explants was blocked , IgG - virion complexes were not transported across the surface [ 35 ] . Just as we found with HIV - 1 , FcRn - mediated transcytosis of CMV occurred with both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing antibody , but transcytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody . Finally , immunohistochemical staining of placentas from in utero infections were consistent with this model of FcRn - mediated transcytosis [ 35 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 942}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1107}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1209, "end": 1237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1323}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1334, "end": 1339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1365, "end": 1388}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1469, "end": 1474}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1541, "end": 1570}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1640, "end": 1669}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1783, "end": 1788}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
