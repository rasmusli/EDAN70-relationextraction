ARDS patients suffer from severe hypoxemia , and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) therapy may be necessary to ensure oxygenation . ARDS has various etiologies , including trauma , ischemia - reperfusion injury or infections of various origins , and the associated immunological responses may vary . To support the immunological response in this patient collective , we used intravenous IgM immunoglobulin therapy to enhance the likelihood of pulmonary recovery . Methods : ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) who were placed on ECMO and treated with ( IVIG group ; n = 29 ) or without ( control group ; n = 28 ) intravenous IgM - enriched immunoglobulins for 3 days in the initial stages of ARDS were analyzed retrospectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 498, "end": 517}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 789}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
