In this method , a new target profile is created for the existing drugs through screening of large molecular databases . Owing to advances in computational approaches and development of effective antiviral agents , repurposing has become faster . Using high - throughput screening , researchers have been able to screen large libraries of drugs against novel targets and evaluate their antiviral activity in vitro [ 62 , 63 ] . Some of repurposed drugs have shown potent antiviral activity against MERS - CoV , for example , ribavirin , nitazoxanide and hexachloropene [ 64 ] . Some other studies have repurposed the drugs by using a combination of two or more existing drugs . Wilde et al . combined alisporivir with ribavirin for enhanced antiviral activity against MERS and SARs - CoV [ 65 ] . In another study on MERS - CoV infected marmosets , hybrid of ritonavir / lopinavir and IFN - \u03b21b had positive effect [ 66 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 991}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
