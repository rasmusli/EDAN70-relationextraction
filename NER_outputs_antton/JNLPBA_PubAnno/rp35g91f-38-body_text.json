We selected 16 genes which are known to be involved in regulation of ion transport , almost all of which are also known susceptibility genes for arrhythmia ( Table 6 ) Wang et al . 1995 ) , and analyzed their expression in a publicly available mRNA microarray data set generated by Deshmukh et al . ( 2015 ) . This study used RNA extracted from left atrial appendage tissue obtained from cardiac surgery patients who were divided into three categories : those with atrial fibrillation who either were or were not in sinus rhythm at the time tissue samples were collected , and those with no history of atrial fibrillation . The patient cohorts represent susceptibility to atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation , respectively , when compared to control samples with no history of atrial fibrillation ( Deshmukh et al . 2015 ) . We compared our genes of interest ( Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP - seq enrichment of Nkx2 - 5 , Srf , and Mef2a in genomic regions proximal to genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network and candidate upstream regulators dysregulated in atrial fibrillation . Of these 16 genes , four were significantly downregulated ( Cacna2d2 , 0 . 5 - fold ; Kcnj5 , 0 . 7 - fold ; Myoz2 , 0 . 7fold ; and Sln , 0 . 7 - fold ) and three were significantly upregulated ( Atp2a2 , 1 . 6 - fold ; Csrp3 , 1 . 8 - fold ; and Gja3 , 1 . 6 - fold ) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts ( Table 6 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 44}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 392}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1111, "end": 1117}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1278}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1290, "end": 1296}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1315}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1382, "end": 1412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1510, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1559, "end": 1565}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1583, "end": 1587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1647, "end": 1654}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1671, "end": 1677}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1698, "end": 1703}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
