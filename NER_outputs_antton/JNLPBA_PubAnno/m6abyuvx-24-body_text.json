However , the Ad - Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild - type mice . Nevertheless , the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein ( serum ALT level over 2 , 000 IU / L ) [ 5 ] ; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient ( about 2 weeks ) . Therefore , this Ad - Cre - dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to chronic HCV hepatitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 193}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 624}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 632, "end": 636}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 689}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 800}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
