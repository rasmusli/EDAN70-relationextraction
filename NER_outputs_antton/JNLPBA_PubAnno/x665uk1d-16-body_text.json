Viral RNA accumulation of six ORFs decreased rapidly in PAA - treated cells at both the early and late stages of infection ( Figure 5C ) .

The expression of ICP0 and ICP4 in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by 72 . 5 % and 74 . 9 % , respectively , compared to HeLa cells during the immediate early stage . At the late infection stage , SCH07072 cells expressed 83 . 1 % and 87 % less UL19 and UL 38 transcripts , respectively , than those of HeLa cells after virus challenge ( Figure 5C ) . However , ICP0 and ICP4 levels were 69 . 4 % and 60 . 7 % lower than in HeLa cells during the immediate early stage of muSCH cell infection , and were similar to the viral RNA content seen in SCH07072 cells . However , at the late stage of infection , the viral RNA accumulation patterns in muSCH cells were similar to those in HeLa cells ( Figure 5C ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 115}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 367, "end": 377}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 518}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 751, "end": 778}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 868, "end": 873}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 877, "end": 882}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1034}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1114, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
