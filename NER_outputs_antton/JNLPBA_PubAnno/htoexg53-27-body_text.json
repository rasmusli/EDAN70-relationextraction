{"cord_uid": "htoexg53", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6316859", "divid": "27", "text": "The recombinant virus MVA - MERS - N produced stable amounts of MERS - CoV N antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus - specific promoter PmH5 [ 46 ] . Moreover , the MERS - CoV N antigen produced in MVA - MERS - N infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that N - specific immune responses were potently activated upon MERS - CoV infection . It seems noteworthy that MERS - CoV productively replicates in rabbits , but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms . However , Haagmans et al . found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the MERS - CoV N antigen in bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose [ 60 ] . The localization of N in these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity [ 61 ] . This might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of MERS - CoV N - specific antibodies despite a barely productive MERS - CoV infection . Similar outcomes of infection were observed upon MERS - CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non - human primate models [ 62 , 63 ] . Thus , the induction of N - specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the MERS - CoV N protein to serve as vaccine antigen .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 85}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 281}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 326}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 406}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 472}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 819, "end": 840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 941, "end": 943}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1216, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1479, "end": 1481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1569, "end": 1590}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
