Some , such as IgA nephropathy and rheumatoid pericarditis have shown plasma cell infiltration and IgA staining [ 89 ] . In KD it is proposed that these plasma cells mature in situ from initial B cell infiltration . Monoclonal B cell infiltrates have been shown in other disorders [ 90 ] . Additionally , in situ lymphoid neogenesis is described in numerous inflammatory and infectious disease systems [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] [ 94 ] and some oncologic processes [ 95 , 96 ] . Localized inflammation and cellular damage may lead to exposure of previously hidden self - antigens setting off a localized autoimmune cascade [ 97 ] . From pure pathological studies , it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA + plasma cell infiltrates seen in KD represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 155, "end": 197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 205}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 888, "end": 904}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
