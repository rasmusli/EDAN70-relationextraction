In humans , these viruses are etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ; SEOV , PUUV ) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( HCPS ; SNV ) [ 1 ] . These diseases share many pathologic similarities and because little damage to the endothelium occurs during infection , it is thought that the inflammatory immune response contributes to pathogenesis [ 17 , 18 ] . Because the Norway rat is a model organism with many specific reagents , including monoclonal antibodies to immune markers , significant progress has been made toward understanding the reservoir host immune response to SEOV [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Fewer methods and reagents are available for bank voles and deer mice . Despite these limitations , emerging technologies will be useful for understanding why rodent reservoirs are infected without disease and why they are unable to clear infection . A significant limitation of HFRS research is that none of the HFRS - causing hantaviruses cause disease in animal models . However , two New World hantaviruses cause an HCPS - like disease in Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) : Andes virus ( ANDV ) and Maporal virus ( MAPV ) [ 22 , 23 ] . ANDV causes most HCPS cases in South America ; however , no human cases of disease have been associated with MAPV . ANDV is hosted by the long - tailed pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys longicaudatus ) and MAPV is hosted by the delicate pygmy rice rat ( Oligoryzomys delicatus ) [ 24 , 25 ] . ANDV is considered an animal biosafety level - 4 pathogen in most nations , whereas MAPV is considered an ABSL - 3 virus [ 26 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 862}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 880}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
