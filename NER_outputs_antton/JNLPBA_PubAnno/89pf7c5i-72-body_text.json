Both treated and untreated cats may live for years before the deterioration of their health status mainly due to renal and heart injuries that might be unrelated to L . infantum infection . The exact role of L . infantum infection in the development of multiorgan injury causing renal , cardiac or hepatic disease has to be confirmed .
