Such was described by some authors because they found that the essential oils studied significantly suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of the cytokines in stimulated cells , assuming therefore , that the inhibitory effect of these essential oils on the expression of the pro - inflammatory cytokines occurs mainly at transcriptional level [ 103 , 116 , 123 , 124 ] . Thyme essential oil , mainly constituted by pcymene and thymol , only at high concentrations ( 5 , 000 mg / L ) significantly inhibited total mRNA IL - 1\u03b2 expression in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by TNBS , not inhibiting significantly IL - 6 expression [ 125 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 102}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 828, "end": 835}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
