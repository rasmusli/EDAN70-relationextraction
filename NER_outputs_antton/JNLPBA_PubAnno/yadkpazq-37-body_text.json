CpG - A molecules should thus not be left aside when stimulating innate immunity for prophylactic purposes . Future studies should aim at optimizing the kinetics of these molecules in vivo , while addressing safety , stability and manufacturing issues . Combinations with adjuvants or other TLR agonists as well as optimized administration protocols should support research in this direction . Field studies with larger cohorts of animals will provide further insights on the utilization of CpG - A molecules for the prevention of viral infections in a clinical setting .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 144}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 417, "end": 421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 635}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
