Using HIVIG or the anti - gp41 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) 2F5 , we found that transcytosis occurred with virus inocula as low as 2 pg of p24 ( about 60 , 000 RNA copies ) with HIVIG and 0 . 02 pg of p24 ( about 500 RNA copies ) with 2F5 , amounts too small to be detectable in subnatant fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV - 1specific antibody ( Table 1 ) . These quantities of virus are within the range observed in seminal and cervicovaginal fluids of HIVinfected individuals [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 236}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 248}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 327}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 389}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 423}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 533}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
