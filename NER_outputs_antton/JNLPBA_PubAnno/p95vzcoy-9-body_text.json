These colonies were kept in nesting tubes ( 155 mm length , 14 inner diameters ) and fed with Drosophila hydei and sugar - water ad libitum ( 40 % mass fraction of sugar ) . For the experiment , the colonies were transferred into boxes ( 60 \u00d7 70 \u00d7 15 mm ) attached to a foraging arena ( 200 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 120 mm ) . Humidity in the nest was maintained with a moist cotton ball . Red foil covered the nest boxes to reduce stress [ 51 ] . The foraging arenas had an opening covered with removable insect nets and the edges were covered with paraffin oil to minimize escape . The colonies were maintained at RT ( 19 - 23 \u2022 C ) with a natural day / night cycle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
