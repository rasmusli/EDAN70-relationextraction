Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of , 3 mg / ml and up to , 15 mg / ml of Env - specific IgG [ 18 ] . Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV - 1 at 5 mg / ml . Moreover , all of our samples mediated transcytosis at # 12 . 5 mg / ml of total IgG , well below total IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of HIVinfected men and women [ 18 ] . Even during acute HIV infection , when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest , 23 of 23 subjects ( 100 % ) were reported to have anti - gp41 IgG antibodies and 40 % had anti - gp120 IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids [ 17 ] . Anti - gp41 IgG levels were on average 11 - fold higher than gp41 - specific IgA levels ; anti - gp41 IgM was found less frequently and in lower quantity . Thus , HIV - 1 immune complexes are likely to occur in mucosal secretions , are likely to contain predominantly IgG , and under acidic conditions , would be subject to FcRn - mediated transcytosis in an exposed host .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 21}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 339}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 532, "end": 536}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 769, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 883, "end": 899}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 944, "end": 964}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1207, "end": 1212}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
