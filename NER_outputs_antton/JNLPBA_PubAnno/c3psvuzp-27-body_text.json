{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "27", "text": "The exact antiviral consequences of macro - PARP action , and their cellular context , still remain unclear . However , recent studies on macro - PARPs implicate two candidate cellular processes . First , several PARP proteins ( PARPs 5a , PARP13 , PARP14 and PARP15 ) have been shown to be important for nucleation of stress granules in the cytoplasm , with ADP - ribosylation modulating miRNA activities [ 14 , 29 ] . This suggests that ADP - ribose in stress granules , or the miRNA functions that are altered by ADPribosylation , are targets for arms races with viruses . Stress granules have been shown to have antiviral properties stemming from mRNA sequestration , degradation and translational repression [ 60 ] . In contrast , several viruses localize to stress granules and employ them for replication [ 60 ] . Our model suggests that stress granule - associated PARP genes may be evolving to either combat the hijacking of stress granules or miRNA by viruses , or as direct mediators of the antiviral functions of stress granules or miRNAs . Alternatively , macro - PARPs may act at the level of gene expression , where ADP - ribosylation and macro - PARPs may influence transcription regulatory complexes . Indeed , after the initial discovery that PARP9 was highly expressed in aggressive Bcell lymphomas [ 61 ] , PARP9 and 14 were shown to regulate expression of several immunity - related genes [ 50 , 62 ] . Thus , one possible explanation for positive selection in the macro - PARP genes is that viral antagonists target them to prevent transcription of antiviral genes . Such viral antagonism could not only inform us of the role for macro - PARPs in the cells , but could also be used as a guide to devise useful interventions for treatment of the aggressive lymphomas that are associated with high PARP9 expression . Whether macro - PARPs are operating in stress granules or for antiviral transcription , or in both processes , our model suggest that host macrodomains , and ADP - ribosylation , play a critical role in formation of antiviral complexes , whereas viruses actively target these complexes for antagonism .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 49}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 138, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 395}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 486}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 845, "end": 884}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 959}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1051}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1083}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1327, "end": 1333}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1340}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1385, "end": 1410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1486, "end": 1505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1571, "end": 1587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1652, "end": 1666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1818, "end": 1824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1845, "end": 1859}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1971, "end": 1989}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 2053, "end": 2073}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
