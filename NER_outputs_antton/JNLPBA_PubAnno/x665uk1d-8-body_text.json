{"cord_uid": "x665uk1d", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4072776", "divid": "8", "text": "The gene encoding 3D8 scFv was introduced into HeLa cells to test whether 3D8 scFv expressing cell lines could protect against DNA virus ( HSV - 1 and PRV ) infection . The DNAs coding for both the wild - type 3D8 scFv protein ( SCH ) and the inactive DNase - mutated 3D8 scFv protein ( muSCH ) were cloned under the transcriptional dependence of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3 . 1 / V5 - HisB vector ( Figure 1A ) . Three 3D8 scFv lines ( SCH07041 , SCH07071 , and SCH07072 ) and mutated 3D8 scFv ( muSCH ) were selected by serial dilution in media containing G418 [ 28 ] . We evaluated 3D8 scFv expression levels in selected cell lines by quantitative real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , flow cytometric analysis , and immunocytochemistry . According to quantitative real - time RT - PCR , SCH07072 expressed the highest 3D8 scFv RNA compared to that of the other two cell lines ( 1 . 3 and 4 times more ) . The mutant 3D8 scFv - transfected ( muSCH ) cells expressed similar levels of 3D8 scFv RNA to SCH07072 ( Figure 1B ) . Flow cytometry data revealed that when the mean for the HeLa cell line as a control was 79 . 48 , SCH07041 , SCH07071 , and SCH07072 were 88 . 45 , 109 . 17 , and 126 . 38 , respectively ( Geo mean : HeLa = 74 . 51 , SCH07041 = 76 . 88 , SCH07071 = 89 . 89 , and SCH07072 = 115 . 33 ) and was similar to the results shown in the quantitative real - time RT - PCR analysis ( Figure 1C ) . Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 and muSCH were targeted and localized in both the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure 1D ) . Common features of anti - DNA antibodies that have a large number of positively - charged residues within complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) of VH or VL domains due to their antigen binding properties , which resemble the nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells , such as cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) [ 29 ] . Therefore , 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in the cytosol using a vector system and targeted to the nucleus by a NLS .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 27}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 233}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 285}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 293}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 413}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 510}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 518}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 600, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 887}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1178, "end": 1187}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1198}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1213}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1297, "end": 1306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1327}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1506, "end": 1524}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1540, "end": 1546}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1641, "end": 1663}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
