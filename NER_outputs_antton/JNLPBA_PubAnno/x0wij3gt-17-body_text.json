EP4 has been shown to a target molecule in cancer cell proliferation [ 19 ] . To investigate the mechanisms involved in PGE 2 - mediated bronchial epithelial cell proliferation , we transfected cells with EP4 siRNA or pre - treated cells with the EP4 antagonist AH23848 ( 10 \u03bcM ) . After pre - treatment with EP4 siRNA or antagonist , cell proliferations induced by PGE 2 decreased ( Fig . 2a and b ) . EP4 antagonist AH23848 decreased cell proliferation induced by PGE 2 ( 1 . 456 \u00b1 0 . 046 vs 2 . 078 \u00b1 0 . 299 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 01 ; 1 . 131 \u00b1 0 . 052 vs 1 . 838 \u00b1 0 . 074 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) . EP4 siRNA decreased cell proliferation induced by treatment with PGE 2 ( 1 . 243 \u00b1 0 . 018 vs 1 . 480 \u00b1 0 . 029 in BEAS2B , P < 0 . 05 ; 1 . 086 \u00b1 0 . 124 vs 1 . 866 \u00b1 0 . 015 in HBEc14 - KT , P < 0 . 01 ) . This effect was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 ( Fig . 2c and d ) ( Fig . 2e ) . So we conclude that EP4 mediates cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 84}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 415, "end": 425}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 529}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 617}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 819, "end": 829}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
