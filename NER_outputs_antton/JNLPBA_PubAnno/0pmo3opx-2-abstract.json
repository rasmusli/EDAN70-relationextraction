{"cord_uid": "0pmo3opx", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5431086", "divid": "2", "text": "The M1 family of metalloproteases represents a large number of exopeptidases that cleave single amino acid residues from the N - terminus of peptide substrates . One member of this family that has been well studied is aminopeptidase N ( APN ) , a multifunctional protease known to cleave biologically active peptides and aide in coronavirus entry . The proteolytic activity of APN promotes cancer angiogenesis and metastasis making it an important target for cancer therapy . To understand the substrate specificity of APN for the development of targeted inhibitors , we used a global substrate profiling method to determine the P1 - P4 \u2032 amino acid preferences . The key structural features of the APN pharmacophore required for substrate recognition were elucidated by x - ray crystallography . By combining these substrate profiling and structural data , we were able to design a selective peptide inhibitor of APN that was an effective therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo against APN - expressing prostate cancer models .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 34}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 77}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 129}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 235}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 241}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 523}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 637}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 699, "end": 703}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 918}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
