We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2 / EP4 - mediated kinase signaling pathways . However , the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown . We evaluated the effects of c - Jun and 3 - phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase - 1 ( PDK1 ) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 493}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 547}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 554}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
