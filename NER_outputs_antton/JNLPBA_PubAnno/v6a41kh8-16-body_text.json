In brief , nucleic acids were extracted from 360 \u03bcl of NPA ( or plasmid RNA from positive control transcripts ) using a nucleic acids extraction kit ( Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit , F . Hoffman - La Roche Ltd , Basel , Switzerland ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control ( virus transport medium ) , starting at nucleic acid isolation . Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 \u03bcl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors . cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers , murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( ABI , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) , RNase inhibitor ( ABI ) and 3 \u03bcl of extracted viral RNA . Amplification reactions were performed using GeneAmp \u00ae PCR System 2700 ( ABI ) . Ten \u03bcl of newly synthesized cDNA was added to a mix consisting of 2 . 5 U of AmpliTaq \u00ae Gold DNA polymerase ( ABI ) and a Super - Mix containing seven pairs of forward and backward primers flanking unique sequences of the seven viruses ( the hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1 , 2 and 3 , the matrix protein gene of InfA , the NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB , the NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV ) . After initially holding the PCR mixture at 95 \u00b0 C for 10 min , amplification was performed as follows : two cycles at 95 \u00b0 C for 1 min , 55 \u00b0 C for 30 sec and 72 \u00b0 C for 45 sec , and then 38 cycles at 94 \u00b0 C for 1 min , 60 \u00b0 C for 30 sec , 72 \u00b0 C for 30 sec , followed by an additional 7 min at 72 \u00b0 C and immediate cooling to 4 \u00b0 C . After amplification , the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN Inc , Valencia , CA , USA ) and analyzed by enzyme hybridization assay [ 15 ] , measuring the optical density at 450 nm ( OD 450 ) using a micro - plate reader ( Stat Fax \u00ae 2100 , Awareness Technology Inc , Palm City , FL , USA ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 238}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 496}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1019, "end": 1024}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1130}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1132, "end": 1136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1202}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1204, "end": 1208}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1242}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1353, "end": 1358}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1418, "end": 1433}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1435, "end": 1439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1485, "end": 1514}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1631, "end": 1651}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1665, "end": 1683}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1697, "end": 1715}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1730, "end": 1748}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1788, "end": 1792}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
