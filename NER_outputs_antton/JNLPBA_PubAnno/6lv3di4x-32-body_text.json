As controls , MDM were challenged with JEV from our virus stocks at an MOI adapted to that of the basolateral NEC medium . To determine if epithelial alarmins influence JEV infection ( Laos ; MOI , 1 TCID 50 / cell ) of MDM , recombinant human IL - 25 , IL - 33 , TSLP ( Thermo Fisher ) , or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng / ml each , with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation . For MDM infection , the cells were incubated 1 . 5 h at 37 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 with the virus , washed three times with PBS [UNK] / [UNK] , and incubated at 39 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 for 24 h in fresh DMEM - 2 % FBS . The MDM were harvested as cell suspensions , immunolabeled with the anti - flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 , and acquired on a FACSCantoII ( Becton , Dickinson ) . Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward / side scatter plots , followed by exclusion of doublets using Flowjo V . 9 . 1 software ( Treestar , Ashland , OR ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 458}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 475}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 956}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
