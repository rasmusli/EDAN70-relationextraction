[ 49 ] using nested PCR to amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene ( gltA ) [ 51 ] . Among the Bartonella - positive samples , we randomly selected 5 - 10 positive samples per site for Sanger sequencing ( n = 51 ) . PCR products were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits ( Zymo Research ) and sequenced in both directions at the Georgia Genomics Facility . Resulting chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious ( Biomatters ) [ 52 ] . Post - trimmed forward and reverse sequences were assembled to create 348 base pair ( bp ) consensus sequences for each sample ( n = 35 ; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 172}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 179}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 334}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 584, "end": 614}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 639, "end": 680}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
