For the direct virus binding assay , plates were coated with HIV - 1 JR - FL ( 20 ng p24 / well ) for 2 hours at 37uC , washed with PBS and blocked with 4 % non - fat dry milk in PBS . After 1 hour at 37uC , plates were washed , antibodies were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC . Detector antibody ( horse radish peroxidaselabeled goat anti - human Fc ) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 45 min at 37uC . Finally , plates were washed , developed ( TMB solution , Life Technologies ) , and read at 450 nm using a plate reader ( BioTek ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 34}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 111}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 491}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
