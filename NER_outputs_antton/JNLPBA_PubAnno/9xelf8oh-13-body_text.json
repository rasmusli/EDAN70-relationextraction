{"cord_uid": "9xelf8oh", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC7088385", "divid": "13", "text": "An initial assessment of the ability of the assays to be multiplexed was carried out by comparing C p values obtained with the same DNA templates but with primers used in uniplex , duplex and triplex reactions . A mixture of previously identified positive samples was used to create a DNA template that was positive for the IC and both of the target genes . Multiplex qPCRs were run as 20 \u03bcl final reaction volumes that contained 4 \u03bcl 5 \u00d7 QuantiTect \u00ae virus Master Mix ( Qiagen , Manchester , UK ) , appropriate amounts of each primer and probe ( Table 1 ) and ca . 50 ng template DNA . Thermal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95 \u00b0 C , followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0 C and 75 s at 60 C . PCR efficiencies of reliable multiplex qPCRs were assessed using serial dilution of standards ( 10 7 - 10 2 copies and 5 7 - 5 2 copies ) with five reactions per dilution . As neither virus is readily isolated in cell culture , we modified the qPCR protocol of O ' Callaghan and Fenech ( 2011 ) to quantify the amount of target DNA . Briefly , known quantities of synthetic oligonucleotides ( Eurofins MWG Operon , Edersberg , Germany , or Integrated DNA Technologies , Leuven , Belgium ) ( see Online Resource S2 ) for calculations to determine number of copies based on molecular weight of the oligonucleotides ) , whose single - stranded DNA sequences are those of the control and target genes that binds the probe , are used to create a standard curve against which the amount of target DNA in the unknown samples can be calculated ( O ' Callaghan and Fenech 2011 ) . With no gold standard assay for either target and therefore no confidence about a ' truly negative ' sample , Lambda ( \u03bb ) DNA ( Fisher Scientific , Loughborough , UK ) was added to the serial dilutions to ensure the same quantity of DNA overall in each qPCR ( Online Resource S3 ) . Only multiplex qPCRs with efficiencies between 90 and 110 % for all assays were retained .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 146}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 298}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 343, "end": 356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 585}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1028}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1351}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1380, "end": 1393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1480, "end": 1491}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1695}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
