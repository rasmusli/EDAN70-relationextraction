To colonize the LRT , an organism must overcome mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis by resident alveolar macrophages , neutrophils and monocyte - derived macrophages [ 37 , 38 ] , but many URT pathogens have developed strategies to overcome these barriers . H . influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis resist mucociliary clearance by impairing ciliary function .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 243}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
