Here , we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting bacterial sialidase . These compounds show striking competitive inhibitory effects against sialidase from C . perfringens ( Cp - NanI ) . Importantly , C . perfringens is a human pathogen causing various gastrointestinal diseases such as enterotoxaemia , gas gangrene and peritonitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 381}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 462}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
