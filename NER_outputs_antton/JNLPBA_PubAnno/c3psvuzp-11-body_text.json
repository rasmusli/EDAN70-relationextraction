Vaults are barrel - shaped particles composed of three proteins , MVP ( major vault protein ) , PARP4 , and TEP1 ( telomerase associated protein ) , as well as vRNA ( vault RNA ) [ 44 ] . The function of vaults is unknown , but they have been implicated in drug resistance , cancer and immunity . In support of a role in immunity , MVP , the core structural component of the . 10 mDa mass of vaults , is upregulated by IFN , and vaults are most highly expressed in immune cell types such as dendritic cells and macrophages [ 45 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 99}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 237}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 344}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 366}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 376}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 387}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 419}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 439}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 451}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 485}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 610}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 673}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 693, "end": 697}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
