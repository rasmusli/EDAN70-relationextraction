Furthermore , the interferon response was most likely responsible for the transient expression of the CD69 very early activation marker on lymphocytes during acute LDV infection . IFNa - dependent , partial activation of lymphocytes has also been reported during acute infection with Semliki forest virus [ 20 ] , human adenovirus 2 , West Nile virus , and A / WSN influenza virus [ 32 ] in mice . However , not all acute viral infections induce partial activation , as it does not occur in Friend retrovirus infections of mice [ 16 ] . Such broad activation is by definition non - specific , and leaves open the question of how it benefits the host . Alsharifi et al . have proposed that IFNa - induced partial activation may promote adaptive immune responses by lowering the threshold for full activation once antigen - specific recognition occurs [ 33 ] . If so , IFNa may be a very important regulatory link between the innate and adaptive immune responses . Based on the findings that CD69 acts downstream of IFNa to inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs [ 17 ] , it is also likely that CD69 expression facilitates sustained contacts between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells during inflammatory responses , thereby enhancing full activation of antigen - specific lymphocytes . 0049 by t test ) . A representative histogram of CD69 expression on cells from LDVinfected mice that were pDC - depleted pDC 2 ) or mock - treated ( pDC + ) is shown . The histograms of cells from na\u00efve animals overlapped with the curves from pDC depleted mice ( data not shown ) . ( C ) pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma as indicated by results from semiquantitative real - time RT - PCR as previously described [ 16 ] . Relative LDV levels are indicated by real time PCR critical threshold ( Ct ) values , which were not significantly different between LDV - infected normal mice ( pDC + ) Ct = 22 . 05 + / 20 . 33 , and LDV - infected , pDC - depleted mice ( pDC 2 ) Ct = 21 . 72 + / 20 . 43 ( n = 5 ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0006105 . g003 TLR7 wild type and knockout mice on the 129SvEv genetic background were infected with LDV and blood was analyzed at 16hpi . ( A ) IFNa levels in plasma were significantly reduced in TLR7 2 / 2 mice as measured by ELISA ( PBL Interferon Source ) . Values in TLR7 + / + mice averaged 795 . 5 pg / ml while only trace amounts of IFNa were detected in TLR7 2 / 2 mice ( TLR7 + / + vs . TLR7 2 / 2 p = 0 . 0041 by T test ) . ( B ) The low levels of IFNa in TLR7 2 / 2 mice correlated with reduced percentages of lymphocytes expressing CD69 ( TLR7 + / + 57 . 30 % + / 24 . 15 % CD69 + vs .
