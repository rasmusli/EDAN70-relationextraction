Addition of N - terminal capping groups to the peptides completely abrogated any inhibitory ability . Next , the peptides were cyclized through the formation of a disulfide bond using N and C - terminal cysteine residues ( Cys - XHSPW - Cys = cyc - XHSPW ) . The cyclization of the parent nHSPW peptide through cysteine residues ( cyc - nHSPW ) also eliminated any measureable inhibition of APN ; however , cyclization of the leucine derivative ( cyc - LHSPW ) yielded an inhibitor with a K i of 24 . 7 \u03bcM . Truncation of the core sequence revealed the importance of Pro4 and Trp5 in determining the affinity of the cyclic peptide , resulting in K i values of 121 . 4 \u03bcM and > 500 \u03bcM for the cyclic tetrapeptide and tripeptide derivatives , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 29}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 762}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 771}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
