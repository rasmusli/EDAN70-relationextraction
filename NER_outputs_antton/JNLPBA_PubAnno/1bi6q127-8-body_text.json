[ 25 ] showed that in cultured cells of black flying foxes , interferon - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) were expressed at higher levels than their human counterparts . They also demonstrated that an antiviral effector 2 - 5A - dependent endoribonuclease ( RNase - L ) is a unique downstream ISG gene , which is stimulated directly by interferon in bat cells [ 25 ] . The activated RNase - L can then cleave viral mRNA . In contrast , in human cells , RNase - L is not directly stimulated by interferon but via an intermediate molecule , 2 , 5 - oligoadenylate ( 2 - 5A ) synthetase [ 26 ] . Similarly , direct activation of RNase - L was also observed in in vivo experiments with Jamaican fruit bats ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) [ 27 ] . Inactivation of the RNase - L gene renders bat cells more susceptible to virus infection and direct induction of RNase - L may provide bats with an additional layer of antiviral defense [ 25 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 113}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 120}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 272}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 284}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 363}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 409}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 436}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 479}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 642, "end": 652}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 787}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 865, "end": 875}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
