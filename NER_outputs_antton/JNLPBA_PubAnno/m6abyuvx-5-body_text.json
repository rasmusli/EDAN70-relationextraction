Using LC16m8 , a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus ( VV ) , we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses ( rVVs ) that each encoded one of three different HCV proteins and found that one recombinant virus ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins , resolved pathological chronic hepatitis C symptoms in the liver . We also found that immunization with rVV - N25 suppressed HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice ; moreover , this suppression was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells , as has been previously reported [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 313}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 550}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 640}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
