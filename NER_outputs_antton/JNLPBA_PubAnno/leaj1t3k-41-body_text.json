There is a need for improvement in the design of CPP to tackle the issue of in vi vo toxicity and thereby make the drug conjugates safer . As Stein highlights , even though PPMO dose regimens are shown to be nontoxic , it will be necessary to show that treatment with doses several times higher than the expected therapeutic dose is well tolerated [ 60 ] . It is noteworthy that all the PPMO studies were done in collaboration with a company specializing in RNAbased drugs , AVI BioPharma Inc , which first developed the PMO and provided the PPMO compounds . Of all the CPP - antiviral investigations , PPMO studies are the ones that are at the most advanced stage , with several reports of use in animal models and directed against a wide range of viruses . The work on PPMO illustrates the successful collaboration between academia and industry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 555, "end": 560}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 742}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
