Major focal points of the study included ( a ) determination of seasonal variation in terms of ARI specimen collection rates as well as seasonality of isolated ARI pathogens , ( b ) in vitro antibiotic resistance / sensitivity assay for bacterial pathogens , ( c ) coinfection patterns , ( d ) age - dependent distribution patterns of pathogens , and ( e ) a comparison of the detection rates of respiratory pathogens between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases . Knowing the seasonal variability of pathogens would help the parents or guardians of the children as well as physicians to adopt some preventive measures . Antibiogram study was designed to know the condition of antibiotic resistance / sensitivity patterns of major ARI bacterial pathogens to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics to treat ARI patients , which also might help control of the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant strains . Analysis of coinfection status was performed to identify major coinfection partners in terms of virus - bacteria , virusvirus , bacteria - bacteria , virus - bacteria - bacteria , and virus - virus - bacteria . Especially specific identification of bacteria in a coinfection case may help the physicians to choose appropriate antibiotics and additional medications because bacterial coinfection , especially superinfection has been reported to associate with huge fatal outcomes and deaths of under - five ARI patients . On the other hand , age - dependent distribution patterns of pathogens are useful to identify vulnerable age groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 135}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 382}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 951}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1024}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1628, "end": 1632}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
