Protein levels of M1 aminopeptidases have been documented in the brain , pancreas , lung , intestines , prostate , heart , endothelial cells and in components of the immune system 1 , 2 . Each M1 aminopeptidase demonstrates unique substrate specificity by preferring certain amino acids at the N - terminus of their endogenous substrates . For example , aminopeptidase B prefers basic amino acids , whereas aminopeptidase A prefers acidic amino acids 3 . The substrate specificities of the aminopeptidases allow each of them to selectively catalyze the activation or metabolism of bioactive peptides . The most studied member of the mammalian M1 aminopeptidase family is aminopeptidase N ( APN ) , also known as CD13 . APN exists as a dimeric 110 kDa cell surface protein with a small N - terminal intracellular domain , a single - pass transmembrane anchor , a small extracellular stalk , and a large ectodomain on the C - terminus 4 . Cleaving after neutral amino acids , as implied by the \" N \" in its name , APN degrades peptides that are involved in different physiological pathways , including pain sensation and mood disorder by inactivating enkephalin , as well as regulating blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin III 1 , 5 . APN is considered to be a \" moonlighting ectoenzyme \" , possessing functions other than its role as a peptidase 1 . Independent of its enzymatic activity , APN can also act a receptor for viral infection and as an adhesion molecule 6 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1231, "end": 1246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1250, "end": 1264}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1554, "end": 1560}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
