In a comparative analysis of MERS - CoV structural and accessory proteins , it has been shown that M , ORF4a , ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN - antagonizing properties . 22 We , and others , have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA - binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co - activator PACT . 24 , 25 However , the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS - CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN - \u03b2 expression have not been elucidated .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 131}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
