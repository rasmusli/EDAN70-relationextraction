Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers using the First Strand Synthesis kit ( Invitrogen ) . Real - time RT - qPCR was performed using gene - specific primers . As an internal control , real - time RT - qPCR was also performed using the housekeeping gene , RpL32 . The control was set arbitrarily at 1 and fold - increase over control was calculated by the \u0394\u0394Ct method . The experiments were conducted at least three times , each in triplicates . The results were plotted in graph format as mean \u00b1 SD .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
