Descriptive statistics : Monthly prevalences of individual RTI symptoms were computed by taking the average over all subjects available at each month and then averaging over all 18 months covered . Prevalences at the seasonal level were computed accordingly averaging over all three seasons covered . The corresponding confidence intervals ( CIs ) and p - values are based on a generalised linear model with identity link and binomial type variance together with robust variance estimates . The frequency of long lasting infections among all months with infections was analysed accordingly . However , due to the limited number of cases for tonsillitis and otitis media we determined the monthly frequency of long - lasting infections by pooling the data over all seasons and for pneumonia by pooling all indicated months .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 733}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 750}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 860, "end": 870}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
