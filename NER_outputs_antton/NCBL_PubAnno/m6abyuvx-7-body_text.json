As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum ALT levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly ( I : C ) injection ; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the poly ( I : C ) treatment , which causes liver injury [ 11 ] . After this peak , serum ALT levels dropped continuously until day 4 , and then ALT levels began to increase , as did HCV core protein levels . Thereafter , the HCV core protein was expressed consistently for at least 600 days .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 444}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
