Because of the sensitivity of microglia and APCs to CSF1R antagonism , we assessed whether CSF1R antagonism depleted CD11b + , Ly6C + , and Ly6G + cells in the blood , spleen , and bone marrow of PLX5622 - treated versus control - treated uninfected mice . Flow cytometry analysis revealed no significant differences in populations of these cells in uninfected mice ( Additional file 4 ) . Together , these data indicate that circulating APCs , but not bone marrow or splenic mononuclear cells , are decreased in the context of CSF1R antagonism .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 193}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
