{"cord_uid": "payjduek", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6652017", "divid": "17", "text": "The mechanism leading to the BCG reactivation in our patient with measles is not known . One possible mechanism is the reactivation and multiplication of live but dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG bacilli that may have been present at the inoculation site , facilitated by immune suppression induced by measles infection . In one previous case report , a severely malnourished 2 . 5year old boy developed ulceration of a healed BCG scar and possible disseminated BCG infection 2 weeks after measles infection [ 20 ] . Acid - fast bacilli was detected from a swab of the BCG ulcer . This mechanism is , however , unlikely in our patient in view of the rapid onset and resolution of the BCG site erythema / induration with the appearance and resolution of the measles rash . Immune suppression induced by measles would normally be expected to persist for a longer duration [ 21 ] . In addition , the lack of malnutrition in the patient , the otherwise uncomplicated measles course , and the absence of secondary infections normally seen in severe immunosuppressed states further renders this mechanism unlikely . Another possible mechanism for the BCG reactivation , which appears more probable , is an immune - mediated reaction . Cross - reactivity between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins ( HSP ) , in particular mycobacterial HSP 65 and human homologue HSP 63 , have been postulated as the cause of BCG reactivation in children with Kawasaki disease [ 22 , 23 ] . HSP are ubiquitous molecules present in all organisms , including humans , and mediate important functions in protein folding , assembly and transport essential for cell survival [ 24 ] . Synthesis of HSP are increased during conditions of cellular stress , including infection , ischaemia and other physical stresses . In humans , increased production and serum concentrations of HSP , especially HSP 70 , have been reported during viral infections , including measles [ 25 , 26 ] . As homology between HSP 70 and mycobacterial antigens have been demonstrated [ 27 ] , a similar cross - reactivity as thought to occur in children with Kawasaki disease could possibly also explain the BCG reactivation in our patient . These mechanisms are especially intriguing as measles infections typically cause suppression of delayed type hyper and anergy to tuberculin [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 74}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 319}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 375}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 435}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 475}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 489, "end": 507}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 578}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 701}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 714}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 769}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 801, "end": 809}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 917}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 970}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1060}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1482}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1776, "end": 1786}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1929, "end": 1946}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1958, "end": 1966}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 2132, "end": 2149}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 2261, "end": 2280}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 2296, "end": 2330}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
