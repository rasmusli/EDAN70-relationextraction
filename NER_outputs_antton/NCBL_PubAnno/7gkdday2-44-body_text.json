{"cord_uid": "7gkdday2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5367831", "divid": "44", "text": "The study identified 35 cases with viral - bacterial mixed infections where RSV and S . pneumoniae were the predominant viral and bacterial partners , respectively , followed by HRV and K . pneumoniae duo . Each of HRV , RSV , S . pneumoniae , and K . pneumoniae showed a seasonal peak in September and both S . pneumoniae , and K . pneumoniae had significant participation in mixed infections demonstrating that viral infection renders bacterial colonization . Higher rates of bacterial infections by S . pneumoniae and K . pneumoniae in synergy with RSV , HRV , and other viruses may indicate that predominant ARI viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria . The other major viral partners of bacterial mixed infections included HMPV and HPIV . The mechanisms by which viruses influence bacterial colonization and invasion are very diverse . It has been shown that viral infections may predispose to bacterial super - infections by favoring bacterial attachment sites on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and through increased mucous production that promotes bacterial growth [ 55 , 56 ] . The real clinical significance of these infections has not yet been fully elucidated . Under the circumstances , emphasis should be given on deciphering the role of bacterial mixed infections in promoting disease pathology . The presence of pathogens in asymptomatic children made the aspect more puzzling . However , a case control study hypothesized that there could have a subclinical infection in asymptomatic cases which may act as a pathogen transmission source [ 57 ] . It is also important to remember that the detection rate of mixed infection is dependent mostly on methodology and number of pathogens that are being screened . Despite differences in methodologies , the similarity in rates of hospitalized viral respiratory illness in different countries suggests that respiratory viruses indeed are important contributors of childhood hospitalization around the world .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 70}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 499}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 616}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 719, "end": 746}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 926, "end": 936}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1857}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
