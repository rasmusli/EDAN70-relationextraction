CPPs have successfully improved the cellular uptake of various cargoes including proteins [ 26 , 33 ] , nucleic acids ( oligonucleotides [ 34 , 35 ] , peptide - nucleic acids [ 36 , 37 ] , siRNAs [ 38 , 39 ] ) , nanoparticules [ 40 ] and liposomes [ 41 ] in a wide range of cells : mainly in mammalian cells , but also in bacteria [ 37 , 42 ] , yeasts [ 42 ] and protozoan parasites [ 43 , 44 ] . CPPs have proven to be very efficient in delivering molecules into cells that are refractory to transfection such as primary lymphocytes [ 45 ] . In 1999 , Schwarze et a l . successfully delivered into all tissues in mice the 120 - kDa tat - conjugated \u03b2 - galactosidase protein , which retained its enzymatic activity [ 46 ] . Impressively , the conjugate had also crossed the blood - brain barrier and reached the brain tissues , which is usually restricted to small and highly lipophilic peptides . CPPs offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic molecules that are 200 times larger than the current bioavailability size restriction [ 45 ] . CPP - mediated delivery of bioactive compounds into model organisms for cancer [ 47 ] , cardiomyopathy [ 48 ] , stroke [ 49 ] , muscular dystrophy [ 50 ] and viral infections , support the strong therapeutic potential exerted by CPPs . Clinical trials are taking CPP - based drugs a step closer to therapeutic applications . An heptamer arginineconjugated cyclosporine A ( Psorban ) has entered phase II of a clinical trial for topical treatment of psoriasis [ 29 , 51 ] . The oligoarginine peptide allows the penetration of cyclosporine A into cells throughout the otherwise impermeable epidermis and dermis . This review will focus on studies that explored the use of CPPs to deliver antisense agents into virusinfected cells and animal models ( Table 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1275, "end": 1290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1306}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1315, "end": 1334}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1345, "end": 1362}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1646}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
