However , HMPV genome sequence data from Africa is sparse and information on genome - wide diversity is limited . In the present study , the whole genome sequences of five HMPV strains from Kenya and Zambia were determined and compared with the genomes published previously from around the world . Comparative sequence analysis indicated fairly conserved positioning of the gene - start and - end regions as well as translational start and - end codons . Variation in genestart and - end sequences can have significant impact on transcription initiation and termination efficiency so that there is more selective pressure preventing changes in these regions [ 20 ] , and this likely explains our observation . The additional ATG start codon found upstream of the gene - start motif of the SH gene was consistent with a previous report [ 21 ] , though its role in gene expression is yet to be identified .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 32}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 85}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 128}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
