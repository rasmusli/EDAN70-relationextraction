Nevertheless , their overproduction may be responsible for damage at inflammatory sites . In addition these reactive species play important roles in inflammation by being trigger elements or by being signalling messenger molecules . ROS and RNS act as modulators of protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases , membrane receptors , ion channels , and transcription factors , including nuclear factor - \u03baB ( NF - \u03baB ) , which regulate the expression of key cytokines [ 22 ] . This short review reports the potential of essential oils as antioxidants and antiinflammatory agents , as well as the in vitro mechanisms involved in such properties .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
