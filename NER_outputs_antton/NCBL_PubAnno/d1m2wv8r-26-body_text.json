In this study , we first identified a group of cancer - related proteins by a proteomics technique . Some of these proteins were not noted for CPV - induced apoptosis or anti - cancer function , which would provide a new perspective for studying the anti - cancer mechanisms of CPV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 104}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 121}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 268}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
