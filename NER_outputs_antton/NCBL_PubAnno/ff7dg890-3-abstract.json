We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak . Finally , we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 401, "end": 411}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
