The KH2 domain itself is not associated with the RNA , serving rather to bind nsp1 [UNK] , with the complex poised to subvert the elongating ribosome . In its capacity to stall ribosomes , the nsp1 [UNK] - PCBP complex joins a growing list proteins that have been shown to modulate the elongation step of protein synthesis . These include Stm1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which inhibits translation after 80S formation ( 50 ) , the fragile X mental retardation protein , which reversibly stalls ribosomes on its target mRNAs ( 51 ) by binding directly to the ribosome ( 52 ) , the HIF - 1 [UNK] mRNA - associated cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 , which binds eEF2 and slows elongation ( 53 ) and the PUF - Ago - eEF1A complex that attenuates elongation after the nascent peptide emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel ( 54 ) . Stalling of ribosomes by the nsp1 [UNK] - PCBP complex , perhaps as a consequence of a direct interaction with the unwinding centre of the small subunit , could promote PRF in a manner similar to that described for structured RNA stimulators .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 664}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
