There is a major debate over the terminology ' alternative to antibiotics ' because we do not propose substances with antibacterial activity but rather substances that act on bacteria indirectly , either by stimulating the host immune system , by the release of substances that have antibacterial activity or by improving the host gut health and consequently growth performance [ 87 ] . Thus , we will use the terminology \u00ab strategies \u00bb or \u00ab measures \u00bb to describe alternatives to antimicrobials . Due to the multifactorial etiology of PWD , finding case - specific preventive measures against this disease is a challenge for both researchers and veterinarians . Here we give an overview of these preventive strategies , focusing on the most practical and promising ones for the control of PWD in pigs .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 91}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 764, "end": 768}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1022}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
