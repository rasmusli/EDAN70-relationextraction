The fifth sample was collected from a child enrolled in the routine pneumonia surveillance study at Kilifi County Hospital , Kenya , in 2015 . The samples were tested for HMPV by multiplex semi - quantitative real - time reverse transcription PCR ( rRT - PCR ) assays . The rRT - PCR primers and probes used , cycling conditions and assay set up have been described elsewhere [ 28 , 29 ] . Fusion ( F ) and glycoprotein ( G ) encoding genes of the HMPV positive samples were amplified in a one - step RT - PCR assay ( OneStep RT - PCR kit , QIAGEN ) , as described previously [ 7 ] . Partial G or F nucleotide sequences were analyzed by maximum likelihood ( ML ) phylogenetic trees using IQ - TREE [ 30 ] , together with reference strains of HMPV subgroups ( accession numbers AF371337 . 2 , FJ168779 , AY297749 , AY530095 , JN184401 and AY297748 ) . Five HMPV positive samples from the Kenya and Zambia study sites , belonging to the A2a ( n = 1 ) , A2b ( n = 2 ) , B1 ( n = 1 ) and B2 ( n = 1 ) genetic subgroups based on their G and F gene sequences , were selected for whole genome sequencing . Data on age , sex and clinical assessment information collected at the time of sample collection , for the five selected samples , are shown in Table 3 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 133}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 276}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
