In particular , M . domestica spp . are the most important fly species at poultry farms [ 26 ] with regard to mechanical transmission of > 30 different pathogens [ 13 ] , for example , bacteria , protozoa , viruses , and parasite oocysts and eggs . Some viruses can be transported to animals by contact with contaminated body surfaces of flies . In the case of the house fly , it has been shown that rotavirus can be mechanically transported by contaminated fly surfaces [ 21 ] . House flies frequently defecate while feeding and resting on food surfaces [ 27 ] . However , in studies of C . nigribarbis , neither defecation nor vomiting was observed within 24 h after feeding ( data not shown ) . The body surface of the house fly could be contaminated by viruses easier than that of blow flies . This would suggest that the mechanisms of virus transmission by blow flies could be different from those of house flies . Therefore , to evaluate virus transmission mechanisms that are more complex than contact with a contaminated fly surface , blow fly intestinal organs , crop , and gut were analyzed for their possible role in transmission of avian influenza virus . A seasonal consideration is that M . domestica vicina populations are generally highest in the summer in Japan . In fact , no house fly was found around any poultry farm or pigpen in Tamba Town during our survey in March . Therefore , it seems reasonable that winter blow flies may be involved in transmission of winter pathogens , like influenza virus , by maintaining minimum infectious titers .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 595}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1329, "end": 1351}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1690, "end": 1700}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
