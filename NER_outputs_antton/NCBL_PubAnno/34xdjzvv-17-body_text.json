In our study , we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice from being infected ( Fig . 4 ) ; viral load from different tissues ( CNS and muscle ) of N3 - treated hSCARB2 - transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non - treated groups ( Fig . 5 - 6 ) . These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection . Indeed , several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71 - induced immunopathogenesis [ 19 , 32 ] . Clinical , radiological , and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [ 33 ] . Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [ 13 , 15 ] . CXCL10 , CCL3 , IL - 6 , TNF - a , IL - 1b , and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71infected hSCARB2 - transgenic mice . After N3 treatment , reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed ( Fig . 7 , 8 , 9 ) . Moreover , similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN - c , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , and IL - 13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG . Beside EV71 , coxsackievirus - induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury , and immune infiltration and reclamation [ 34 , 35 ] . Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [ 36 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 118}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 838}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 988}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 992, "end": 995}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1457}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1502, "end": 1517}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1527, "end": 1539}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1566, "end": 1581}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1751, "end": 1773}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
