Furthermore , AMR was identified as a recently coined term and many professionals including physicians were not familiar with the term even though they were knowledgeable of the topic itself . The next quote is an example of such reports : \" I guess AMR , this phrase ( . . . ) if you were to tell me it ' s AMR , I would not know it ' s antimicrobial resistance . \" - I01 , Human Health Participants also remarked there was low awareness of AMR both as a topic as well a term among other One Health stakeholders including farmers and others within the environmental health sector . When we contacted potential participants from the environment sector , very few agreed to be interviewed since many reported not having conducted sufficient work related to AMR . The next quote highlights the concerns expressed by an environmental health expert who was worried about the lack of awareness among his colleagues at \" the ground level \" : \" At the ground level , they were saying , \" What is AMR ? \" People don ' t really know . ( . . . ) How do we address it ? This is a difficult question . \" - I09 , Environment Health Awareness was also perceived to be low in the general population as expressed by participants . Timely awareness efforts by the academic sector had not yet reached the general population . Since 2016 , Singapore has been actively participating in the annual World Antibiotic Awareness Week every November , reaching out to the public at various public forums , hospitals and national libraries [ 22 , 23 ] . In 2017 , the MOH and Health Promotion Board organized a social campaign focusing on the general prevention of infection to fight the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza and hand , foot and mouth disease [ 24 ] . This was closely followed by a \" Use Antibiotics Right \" campaign with the key message that antibiotics do not work on viruses [ 25 ] . Despite these efforts many participants voiced the lack of civil society or social groups movements to support the agenda of AMR in contrast to the high HIV awareness in the early 90s .
