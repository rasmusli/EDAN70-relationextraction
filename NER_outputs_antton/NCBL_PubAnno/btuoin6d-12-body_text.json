All patients were admitted via the emergency department . Out of 445 cases , 194 cases were excluded . The reasons for exclusion were no respiratory viral PCR test for 170 patients , incomplete data for 20 patients , immediately transferred to the tertiary medical center for two patients , and admission for treatment of underlying diseases for two patients . Two patients who were admitted suspicious combined to underlying disease managed to acute asthma exacerbation . Consequently , 251 patients were enrolled in this study , among whom 67 patients had a positive PCR test for adenovirus ( Adv group ) , while 184 patients had a negative PCR test for adenovirus ( Non - Adv group ) . Among the Non - Adv group patients , no pathogen was detected in 50 patients in all culture assays ( unknown pathogen group ) , while 134 patients were diagnosed with other viruses , bacteria , and combined pathogens ( Non - Adv group ) . Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the Adv and Non - Adv groups at admission . The median age was 21 . 6 years , and all patients were healthy males prior to the onset of illness . The number of current smokers was significantly higher in the Adv group than in the Non - Adv group ( 22 . 2 % vs . 5 . 4 % , respectively ) , with recent smokers ( < 30 days ) only identified in the Adv group ( n = 4 ) . A few patients had an underlying disease , such as asthma ( n = 3 ) , allergic rhinitis ( n = 3 ) , and pneumothorax ( n = 2 ) . No differences in the duration of symptoms and the time from symptom onset to admission were observed between the two groups ( 3 . 6 \u00b1 1 . 8 d vs . 3 . 2 \u00b1 2 . 3 d , P = 0 . 224 ) . All patients had clinical symptoms and signs of upper or lower respiratory tract infection . Adv group patients showed more symptomatic instabilities , such as fever , cough , myalgia , headache , and nasal congestion . At admission , initial vital signs and pneumonia severity index ( PSI ) scores were not significantly different between the two groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 567, "end": 574}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1525, "end": 1532}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1544, "end": 1562}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1578, "end": 1591}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1833, "end": 1876}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1945, "end": 1951}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1953, "end": 1959}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1961, "end": 1969}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1971, "end": 1980}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1986, "end": 2003}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 2044, "end": 2054}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
