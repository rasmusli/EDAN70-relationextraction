There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline chronic gastroenteropathy . This prospective , multi - center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non - specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and / or diarrhea . The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting ( n = 25 ) , with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea ( n = 2 ) or diarrhea alone ( n = 3 ) . Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea , and if they were panhypoproteinemic , hypoalbuminemic , hypocobalaminemic , or had a Spec fPL \u2265 5 . 4 \u00b5g / L . Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks . Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a numeric reduction in the number of vomiting episodes over the 4 - week period , but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions . When looking within dietary groups , significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69 . 1 , 73 . 3 , and 63 . 2 % ( p values of 0 . 008 , 0 . 003 , and 0 . 029 ) in weeks 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , when compared to week 0 . The probability of vomiting also showed significant reductions in cats fed Diet A between weeks 0 and 2 , 3 , and 4 , with odds ratios of 0 . 008 , 0 . 005 , and 0 . 005 , respectively ( p values of 0 . 038 , 0 . 23 , and 0 . 23 ) . Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline chronic vomiting . Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2 - to 4 - week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 360}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 490}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 681}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 727}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 745}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 816}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 891}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 904, "end": 913}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 1016}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1077}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1089}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1127}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1145}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1147, "end": 1165}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1363, "end": 1372}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 2102, "end": 2119}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
