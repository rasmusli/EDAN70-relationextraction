Within the latter domain , we previously identified a conserved motif 123 GKYLQRRLQ 131 ( 19 ) as a potential RNA binding motif ( RBM ) that forms one of three [UNK] helices in the region between the catalytic residues of PLP1 [UNK] ( C 96 and H 165 ; Ref . 19 ) . To investigate the importance of these activities to Nucleic Acids Research , 2016 , Vol . 44 , No . 12 5495 trans - activation of PRF , amino acid substitutions were introduced into the protease active site ( C96S ; PR ) or within the putative nsp1 [UNK] RBM ( K 124 A / R 128 A , mutant RBM ; previously described as mutant 1 [UNK] KO ( Li et al . , ( 19 ) ) and the expressed variants tested in RRL ( Figure 1D ) . In this experiment , the protease - defective variant retained full activity , ruling out the involvement of the protease activity of nsp1 [UNK] in the stimulation of PRF . In contrast , the RBM mutation prevented frameshifting , supporting a role for RNA binding by nsp1 [UNK] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
