The PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing dengue virus , West Nile virus and other flaviviruses . 16 As shown in Figure 3e , ZIKV - prME vaccination yielded significant neutralisation response with anti - ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres ( inverse of the serum dilution at which 50 % of the control ZIKV infection was inhibited ) of 456 \u00b1 5 , whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV - Cap DNA vaccine immunized mice was 33 \u00b1 6 which was minimally higher than that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals ( titre = 15 \u00b1 2 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 352}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 370}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 393}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 608}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
