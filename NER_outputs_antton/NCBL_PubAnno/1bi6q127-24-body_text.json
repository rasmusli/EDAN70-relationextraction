This contributes to reactivation of the virus [ 51 ] . Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus - 68 ( MHV - 68 ) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [ 52 , 53 ] . Stressors , such as unfolded protein responses and hypoxia , can induce the expression of viral immediate early genes that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [ 54 ] . Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [ 55 ] . Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [ 56 ] . Gerow et al . [ 57 ] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation , leading to detection of the virus in blood . This reactivation was also associated with a low level of antibodies against the virus . Following hibernation the antibody levels increase , which subsequently drives the virus into latency .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 385, "end": 393}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
