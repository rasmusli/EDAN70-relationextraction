The Kan - r PCR fragment and RP DNA along with RP RNA PCR fragment were used as reaction control and sample control respectively . If control bands were absent , the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors . Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
