Mino et al . delivered artificial zinc - finger proteins ( AZPs ) into cultured cells by expressing AZPs in fusion with the 9R peptide . These AZP - 9R conjugates strongly inhibited HPV - 18 replication to 3 % at 250 nM while gene - delivered AZP only achieved 12 % inhibition . PTD4 conjugates were also tested but proved to be less effective than AZPs fused to 9R .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
