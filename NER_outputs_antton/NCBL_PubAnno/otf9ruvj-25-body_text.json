Initially after admission , lymphocyte levels were not different between the groups ( control alive 8 . 3 % \u00b1 3 . 4 ; control dead 8 . 9 % \u00b1 4 . 5 ; IVIG alive 8 . 9 % \u00b1 4 . 4 ; IVIG dead 7 . 3 % \u00b1 5 . 7 ) . However , lymphocyte levels were higher in survivors compared to those in non - survivors ( Fig . 2 ) . The increase in lymphocytes was more prominent in survivors compared to that in non - survivors ( control alive 1 . 74 \u00b1 0 . 85 ; IVIG alive 3 . 16 \u00b1 5 . 03 ; control dead 0 . 92 \u00b1 0 . 17 ; IVIG dead 2 . 13 \u00b1 1 . 55 ; Fig . 3 ) . In addition , in patients treated with IVIG , this increase during treatment was more prominent than that in the control group in the first 28 days ( Fig . 3 ) . Since we did not evaluate differential blood counts routinely , limited data were available for determining significant difference .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
