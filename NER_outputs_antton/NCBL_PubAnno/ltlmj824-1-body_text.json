Local public health centre ( LPHC ) and emergency medical services ( EMS ) personnel responded to the outbreak by conducting initial interviews with suspected cases , transporting patients and specimens and managing contacts . Responders in contact with patients used different levels of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . Full - protection PPE includes a gown , N95 respirator , gloves and goggles . As the transmissibility of MERS is unclear , 3 it is possible that responders were infected by being exposed to MERS patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 64}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 73}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 280}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 326, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 405}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1073}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1153, "end": 1158}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
