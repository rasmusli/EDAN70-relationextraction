After overnight cultivation at 37 \u2022 C , released VLPs were harvested as described above and lysed in protease cleavage buffer ( 50 mM MES pH 6 . 5 , 1 M NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 adapted from [ 55 ] ) . In vitro processing was performed using 2 . 56 \u00b5M Recombinant HIV1 Protease Protein ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) for 9 h at 37 \u2022 C . Processing was terminated by addition of SDS - PAGE sample buffer and boiling .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
