Viral screening consisted of feline coronavirus ( FCoV ) antibody by indirect fluorescent antibody and feline leukemia virus ( FeLV ) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus ( FIV ) antibody by ELISA . Fecal examination included wet smear and zinc sulfate centrifugation flotation and a feline diarrhea PCR panel to detect Campylobacter coli , Campylobacter jejuni , Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin gene , Cryptosporidium spp . , FCoV , feline panleukopenia virus , Giardia spp . , Salmonella spp . , Toxoplasma gondii , and Tritrichomonas fetus . Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea , including , but not limited to FeLV , FIV , hepatic disease , renal disease , and hyperthyroidism . Cats were also excluded if they were panhypoproteinemic , hypoalbuminemic , hypocobalaminemic , or had a Spec fPL \u2265 5 . 4 \u00b5g / L . Cats that tested positive for FCoV antibody , C . perfringens enterotoxin gene , C . coli , and FCoV via the PCR fecal panel were not excluded from the study . All diagnostic analyses were conducted at a third party commercial laboratory . 1 Cats were randomized to be fed one of two commercial veterinary therapeutic dry gastrointestinal formulas , Diet A 2 or Diet B . 3 No additional foods or treats were permitted . All investigators and participants were masked to the identity of the diet . Study diets were re - packaged into white bags , sealed , and delivered directly to participating veterinary clinics by plant employees not participating in the study . Nutrient analysis ( conducted internally at Iams Analytical Laboratory ) , caloric distribution , and ingredient composition is summarized in Table 1 . Cats were fed according to each product ' s feeding guidelines to maintain body weight .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 583}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 728, "end": 748}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 796}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 824}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 886, "end": 917}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 978}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 990}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1036, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1074, "end": 1090}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1148}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1150, "end": 1166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1168, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
