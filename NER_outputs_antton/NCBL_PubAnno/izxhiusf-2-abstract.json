Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid ( significance cut - off \u2265 10 4 colony - forming units / ml ) was used . Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
