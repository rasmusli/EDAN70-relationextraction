Infected human monocyte - derived macrophages release IL - 8 , IFN\u03b1 , IFN\u03b2 , and TNF [ 66 , 67 ] . Microglia become activated in response to neurotropic WNV infection and upregulate expression of CXCL10 , CXCL1 , CCL5 , CCL3 , CCL2 , TNF , and IL - 6 [ 18 ] . Neurons and astrocytes in WNV - infected brains also release proinflammatory mediators including CCL2 , CCL5 , CXCL10 , IL1\u03b2 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and TNF , which promote lymphocyte trafficking to the CNS [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . In fact , results from a recent study demonstrated that peripheral infection with WNV increased CNS expression of chemokines important for lymphocyte trafficking , including CCL2 , CCL7 , CXCL9 , and CXCL10 , in PLX5622 - treated mice compared with control - treated mice [ 61 ] . Type I IFN response is widely accepted as the most immediate antiviral host response , essential for controlling viral replication during the initial infection . Mice lacking type I IFN signaling are highly vulnerable to uncontrolled WNV replication , exhibiting 100 % mortality [ 68 ] . Clearance of viral infections , however , requires additional immune response including type II IFN , i . e . , IFN\u03b3 , which is produced by activated CD8 + T cells . Mice deficient in IFN\u03b3 show higher peripheral viral load , increased CNS infection , and increased lethality [ 69 ] . Data described here show significantly decreased cytokine expression in PLX5622 - treated mice , which may also contribute to the loss of virologic control via the above - described mechanisms .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 293}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 416}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 698}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1127, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1194, "end": 1200}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1352, "end": 1370}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1416, "end": 1430}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
