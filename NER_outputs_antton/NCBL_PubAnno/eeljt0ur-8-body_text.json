Owners were trained to use the feline Fecal Consistency Scale ( FCS ; Figure 1 ) and to respond to the daily IVRS phone call . On days 1 - 28 , owners received daily IVRS phone calls to record the number of vomiting episodes and presence of diarrhea over the 24 - h period . A diary was provided to track daily observations and to record daily FCS scores .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 170}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 229}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 696}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 730}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
