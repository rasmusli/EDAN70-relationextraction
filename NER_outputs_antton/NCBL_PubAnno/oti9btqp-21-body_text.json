Groups of 10 mice were immunised i . m . with electroporation once with either control plasmid or ZIKV - prME vaccine and challenged 2 weeks later with a total dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU ZIKV - PR209 . Three weeks post challenge , 100 % of the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals survived , whereas only 10 % of the control animals survived ( Figure 6a ) . To determine gross histopathological changes , brain tissue was sectioned into 5 \u03bcmthick sagittal sections , stained for nuclear structures and counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin ( Figure 6b ) . The mice were killed at day 7 or 8 post challenge for the analysis of histology and viral load . The ZIKV infection caused severe brain pathology in the mice . The unvaccinated control ( pVax1 ) mice brain sections showed nuclear fragments within neutrophils ( Figures 6b - i ) ; perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex , lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells of the cerebral cortex ( Figure 6b - ii and iii ) and degenerating neurons within the hippocampus ( Figure 6b - iv ) . In contrast , the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals presented with normal histopathology in brain tissues ( Figures 6b - v and vi ) supporting that protective responses induced by immunisation with the synthetic ZIKA - prME vaccine could limit viral - induced disease in the brain . This observation demonstrates the potential for vaccination to protect the brain in this model . Consistent with the amelioration of body weight loss and mobility impairment in vaccinated mice following ZIKV challenge , a significantly lower viral load was noted in the blood ( Figure 6c ) and brain ( Figure 6d ) of the ZIKV - prME vaccinated animals compared with viral challenged pVax1 vaccinated animals in the high ( 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU ) dose challenge groups . Taken together , these data illustrate that ZI - prME DNA vaccine - mediated immune responses can protect mice against ZIKV challenge .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 118}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 805, "end": 810}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 850}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1615, "end": 1632}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1656}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
