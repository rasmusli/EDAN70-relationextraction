The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes , similar to \u03b1 - fetoprotein ( AFP ) for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . It was not possible in this study to obtain a series of serum samples from individual patients as they progressed through the various stages of hepatitis B infection to severe liver damage ( ACLF ) . However , using iTRAQ and western blotting , several candidate proteins were identified ( namely apolipoprotein J precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ) that warrant further study using a larger number of samples .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 181}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 188}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 428}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 434}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 604}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 627}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 634}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
