{"cord_uid": "6lv3di4x", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6258954", "divid": "3", "text": "Pigs are highly susceptible to JEV infection and rapidly develop viremia , which can last for a few days , during which they can transmit the virus to mosquitoes ( 4 , 6 ) . Infected pigs normally present mild neurological symptoms , but the infection of pregnant sows can cause abortions and stillbirth ( 7 ) . Although JEV infection is typically mosquito borne , contact transmission and high susceptibility to oronasal infection have been described ( 8 ) . Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that JEV can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs , independently of the route of inoculation , for a period of 5 days , with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of viremia ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) . Furthermore , mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions ( 13 ) . These findings represent a warning that JEV could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito - free periods . In fact , a reemergence of JEV in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan ( 14 ) . It is also important to note that vector - free transmission of mosquito - borne flaviviruses is not restricted to JEV and pigs . Several species , including macaques , mice , hamsters , guinea pigs , rats , and squirrel hamsters , are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 17 ) . In addition , nonvector - borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses ( 18 , 19 ) . Examples are Zika virus ( ZIKV ) ( 20 , 21 ) , West Nile virus ( WNV ) ( 22 , 23 ) , St . Louis encephalitis virus ( SLEV ) ( 24 ) , Bagaza virus ( BAGV ) ( 25 ) , Tembusu virus ( TMUV ) ( 26 ) , and Wesselsbron virus ( WESSV ) ( 27 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 73}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 232}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 289}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 304}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 325}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 413, "end": 432}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 510}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 689, "end": 697}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 956}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1137, "end": 1141}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1416, "end": 1420}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1576, "end": 1580}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1677, "end": 1690}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1717, "end": 1728}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1751, "end": 1767}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1789, "end": 1819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1837, "end": 1844}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1868, "end": 1876}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1904, "end": 1922}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
