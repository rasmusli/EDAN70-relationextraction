Studying the nsp1 can advance our understanding of pathogenicity of MERS - CoV and facilitate development of better therapeutics . Host gene expression in infected cells is suppressed by MERS - CoV nsp1 , which also promotes virus assembly or budding in in vitro , leading to efficient virus replication , suggesting nsp1 is also critical for MERS - CoV replication and promotes production of virus particles in the host [ 42 ] . The severity of MERS - CoV infection is relatively more in patients with co - morbid conditions , such as chronic lung disease , renal failure , diabetes and others with compromised immune systems [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 565}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 655}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 671}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 673, "end": 682}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
