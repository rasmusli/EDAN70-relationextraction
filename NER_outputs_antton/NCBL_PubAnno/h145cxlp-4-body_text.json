Based on cases recorded by a nation - wide paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) reporting system , the pre - pandemic ( 2005 / 06 - 2007 / 08 ) , pandemic ( 2009 / 10 ) and post - pandemic ( 2010 / 11 ) annual incidence of severe influenza cases per 100 , 000 children below 15 or 17 years of age was estimated as 0 . 05 , 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 , and 0 . 4 , respectively [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . The data so far available indicated a shift towards younger children in A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 cases from the pandemic to the first post - pandemic season [ 20 ] . In these studies , it remained unclear whether the higher pandemic and post - pandemic incidence in children was caused by higher influenza activity , heightened physician awareness , more frequent or more sensitive influenza testing , or a more severe course of disease of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 [ 18 ] . Furthermore , all these previous studies may have been affected by underreporting , as influenza cases were reported at the discretion of the PICU physician without systematic screening for influenza in patients with severe acute respiratory infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 89}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 523}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 968}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1215, "end": 1225}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1352, "end": 1380}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
