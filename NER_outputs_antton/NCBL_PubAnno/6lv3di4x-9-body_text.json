It has been described that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) , a negative regulator of IFN responses , is upregulated in cells infected by JEV ( 36 ) . Interestingly , 48 to 72 hpi both JEV strains induced a significant upregulation of SOCS1 in NEC , with higher gene expression in Laos - infected cells ( Fig . 4D ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 76}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 219}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 469, "end": 473}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
