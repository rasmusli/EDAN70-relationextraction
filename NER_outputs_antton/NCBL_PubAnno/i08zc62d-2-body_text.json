An array of antiviral sialidase agents have been developed and are commercially available , such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating influenza . However , the development of bacterial sialidase inhibitors has been much less successful . Here , natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp - NanI , a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens , are reported . This bacterium causes various gastrointestinal diseases . The crystal structure of the Cp - NanI catalytic domain in complex with the best inhibitor , diplacone , is also presented . This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme - inhibitor complex . These results provide a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural flavonoids , which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti - sialidase agents .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 196}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 206, "end": 214}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 226}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 237}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 388}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 709}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
