A history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6 - 20 years [ 19 ] .

In the United States , there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden , such as school - based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines , but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that , despite these measures , the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 80}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 319}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 419}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 468}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 951, "end": 958}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
