[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] However , the number of FPLV strains isolated from the adaptive carnivore species and the molecular information associated with these isolates are very limited . Clinical and etiological investigations are very important for discovering the mechanism ( s ) underlying the genetic evolution and pathogenicity of FPLV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 21}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 106}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 121}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 238}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 245}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 437}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 574}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 770}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1052, "end": 1057}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
