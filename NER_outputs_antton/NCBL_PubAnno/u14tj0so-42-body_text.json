Method 3 : First run SimFold on S and G to obtain result G - a pseudoknot - free structure that contains G . Then let G updated be the secondary structure of S containing the relaxed stems of G that include the base pairs of G . By a relaxed stem , we mean a secondary structure containing stacked base pairs , bulges of size 1 and internal loops of maximum size of 3 ( i . e . , either the symmetric loop of 1 \u00d7 1 or the non - symmetric loop of 1 \u00d7 2 or 2 \u00d7 1 but no other loop types ; this is motivated by common practice [ 65 ] ) . Then run method 2 on S and G updated , and store the result . See Example 2 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
