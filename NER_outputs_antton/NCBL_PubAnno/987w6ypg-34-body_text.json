However , this does not preclude an important role of IFITMs in shaping HIV - 1 quasi - species evolution in vivo , possibly as part of the more complex interferon response . An increasing number of reports indicate that the susceptibility of HIV - 1 to IFN\u03b1 changes during the course of the disease in infected patients [ 50 , 51 ] and HIV - 1 strains displaying increased resistance to IFITMs have been selected ex vivo [ 52 ] . These results suggest that the evolutionary pressure exerted by IFITMs on HIV - 1 is likely not neutral . In this respect , it will be of interest to determine whether multiple primary HIV - 1 strains display distinct susceptibilities to IFITMs and whether particular IFITM haplotypes can be associated to distinct HIV - 1 outcomes , as is the case for Influenza virus [ 13 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 80}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 952}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
