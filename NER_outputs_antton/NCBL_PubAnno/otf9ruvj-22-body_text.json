In 11 IVIG patients , bacterial pathogens such as Legionella ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , Pneumocystis jirovecii ( n = 3 ; 11 % ) , and Mycoplasma ( n = 1 ) were identified in BAL samples . Viral infections were more frequent in the IVIG group ( p = 0 . 046 ; Pearson ' s chi - squared test ) , especially influenza infection ( p < 0 . 05 ) . In more than half of the IVIG patients , viral pneumonia was diagnosed according to the results of BAL samples , radiological findings , and clinical symptoms . One or more of the following viruses could be detected in BAL samples : influenza ( n = 10 ; 36 % ) and herpes virus ( n = 9 ; 32 % ) . Herpes virus infection included HSV ( n = 7 ; 25 % ) , CMV ( n = 2 ; 7 % ) , and HHV6 ( in BAL and blood ; n = 1 ) . In 7 of the IVIG - treated patients , fungal infection was diagnosed in urinary tract ( n = 4 ) and abdominal samples ( n = 2 ) . In addition , one patient suffered aspergillosis pneumonia . In three IVIGpatients , no causal pathogen could be identified ( 11 % ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 19}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 127}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 263}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 297}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 357}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 388}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 476}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 518, "end": 523}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 550}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 771}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 790, "end": 813}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 962}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1096}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1120}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
