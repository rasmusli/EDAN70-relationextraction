( A ) Phylogenetic trees were inferred for the nucleotides of the VP2 and NS1 genes . The trees were generated by the neighbor - joining method with bootstrap tests of 1000 replicates using the MEGA 6 . 05 software . The HN - ZZ1 strain isolated in the current study is indicated ( \u2022 ) . The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . ( B ) Amino - acid sequence characterization of the NS1 and VP2 proteins from the HN - ZZ1 strain . might be epidemic in China . If this virus is epidemic , it will place wild and captive animals at increased risk . Although the role of this recombination event between CPV and FPLV in viral pathogenicity is unknown , our preliminary infection studies confirmed the high virulence of this recombinant virus . The intranasal infection studies in six 3 - month - old cats with the HN - ZZ1 isolate resulted in anorexia , vomiting and fever in the affected animals at 2day post infection . Subsequently , the cats began to display severe vomiting and developed watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea , which resulted in nearly 100 % mortality in affected cats at 4 - 6 days post infection . Gross examinations showed that the affected cats were characterized by mild to severe fibrinous to fibrinomucoid enteritis with thickened mucosa , with bleeding spots on the surface of the heart , liver , lungs and spleen ( data not shown ) . At present , the number of strains from Zoo animals that have been characterized by molecular methods are very limited , as can be observed by the scarce complete VP2 sequences available in GenBank . With the emergence and continuous increase of recombinant parvoviruses , our ongoing studies will investigate the geographic distribution of these viruses , monitor their recombination characteristics , identify their virulence determinants by reverse genetics and develop efficient strategies against these novel viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1171}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1192}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1298}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1322, "end": 1343}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1520, "end": 1557}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1562, "end": 1572}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
