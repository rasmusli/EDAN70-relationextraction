One such feature is that tick - borne viruses tend to persist in certain stable foci whereas mosquito - borne viruses may suddenly emerge and they can rapidly spread to new areas and continents causing large epidemics [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . Mosquito - borne flaviviruses are transmitted horizontally from mosquito to vertebrate to mosquito , and for some viruses , humans act as the amplifying host [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . Mosquitoes have a short life compared to ticks , as it can take several years for a tick to develop from egg to adult [ 15 ] . Ticks also only take one blood meal at each of their life stages , larvae , nymph , and adult , this means that tick - borne viruses need to be maintained in infected ticks during a very long time [ 16 ] . Thus , replication in ticks needs to be lower compared to mosquitoes , which have higher viral turnover and a faster generation cycle , this also contributes to the high mutation rate in mosquito - borne flaviviruses , and relative stable genomes of TBFVs [ 17 , 18 ] . Infection of tick - borne flaviviruses usually cause a short viremia in humans and larger vertebrates . This route of transmission has been described as less important in tick - borne flavivirus infection [ 19 ] , instead TBEV has been shown to be transmitted by viremic rodents and among co - feeding ticks without viremia [ 20 ] . Humans act as dead - end hosts since they do not produce high enough viremia to transmit the virus to new ticks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1154}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1184}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1320}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1517, "end": 1525}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
