It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis , angiogenesis and T - cell function , which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome ( 18 ) . Changes in platelet morphology , with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction , may occur in chronic liver diseases , and thrombocytes are activated in chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis . Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with liver cirrhosis has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls ( 19 ) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis . In the present study , levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure . This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 384}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 443}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 530}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 712}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 836}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 994}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
