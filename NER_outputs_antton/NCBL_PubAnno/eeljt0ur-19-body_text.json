Because of this , it was considered that age may have been associated with more severe clinical disease ; however , no significant correlation was observed between age and vomiting occurrence within this study population . Previous studies evaluating diagnostic outcomes of cats with chronic gastroenteropathy have shown that older cats ( mean ages ranging from 9 . 3 to 12 . 6 years ) were more likely to have an underlying neoplastic etiology compared to younger populations ( mean age 7 . 7 - 8 . 9 years ) ( 13 , 14 ) . The population in this present study was relatively younger ( mean age of 7 . 2 years ) and likely had less severe disease than those evaluated in previous studies at tertiary referral practices . Given the risk of underlying neoplastic disease in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy , dietary intervention in conjunction with additional diagnostics is warranted in older patients .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 162}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 480}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 939}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 952, "end": 978}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
