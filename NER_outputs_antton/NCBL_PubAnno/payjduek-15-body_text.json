The clinical symptoms and signs resolved without KD specific therapy , with no coronary artery complications detected on follow up . KD is an acute vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology , occurring mainly in children [ 13 ] . As there are no confirmatory tests , the diagnosis of KD is made based on the presence of fever lasting for 5 days or more , and 4 of 5 principal clinical criteria that include conjunctivitis without exudates , cervical lymphadenopathy , polymorphous rash , changes in the lips or oral mucosa , and changes of the extremities [ 13 ] . A major challenge in the diagnosis and management of KD , however , is the recognition that some infants present with only 2 - 3 clinical features , and therefore do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria . Laboratory investigations may be of some use in this situation of incomplete KD [ 13 ] . BCG reactivation has repeatedly been described as an important sign in incomplete KD , although it is not included in any of the diagnostic algorithms [ 14 , 15 ] . For example , in South Korea , 85 % of children aged < 1 year who were diagnosed with incomplete KD had erythema , induration or crust formation at the BCG inoculation site [ 16 ] . The unexpected finding of BCG reactivation in our patient correctly raised the concern of a possible diagnosis of incomplete KD . Although echocardiography was not performed in the initial phase , no additional supporting clinical or laboratory criteria , other than mild anemia , were found . Reassuringly , the rapid resolution of symptoms precluded any further concerns with regard to the need for KD therapy in the patient .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 17}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 28}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 66}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 81}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 107}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 189}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 273}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 305}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 422}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 461}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 574}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 601}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 621}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 658}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 691}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 756}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 970, "end": 984}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1064, "end": 1078}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1244, "end": 1258}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1271}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1287, "end": 1293}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1468}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1612, "end": 1619}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1741, "end": 1744}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
