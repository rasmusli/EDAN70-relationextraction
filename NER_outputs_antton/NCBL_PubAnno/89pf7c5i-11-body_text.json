However , due to the extensive data on vectorial transmission of the Leishmania group of protozoal parasites to vertebrates , there is no doubt that the essential mode of transmission is by bites of infectious phlebotomine sand flies as for other vertebrate species . This means that in areas where L . infantum is transmitted to dogs , cats are likely to be in contact with the parasite and can also be potentially infected . The sand fly vectors appear to be more permissive in their blood source preferences than thought before . Several studies have demonstrated that cats constitute sources of blood for sand flies [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Moreover , the experimental demonstration of infectiousness of two infected cats to sand flies [ 11 , 20 ] indirectly proves the ability of the vector to properly complete feeding on cats and acquire infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 67}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 163}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
