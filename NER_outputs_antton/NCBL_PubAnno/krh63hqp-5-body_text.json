Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918 , but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1 - related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain . Likewise , improved medical treatments , such as antibiotic treatment for flu - related pneumonia , were certainly a significant factor reducing H1N1 mortality , but these do not appear to fully explain the nature of the pattern of mortality decline seen for H1N1 . For example , the exponential decline in mortality began before the invention of antibiotic treatment .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 513, "end": 537}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
