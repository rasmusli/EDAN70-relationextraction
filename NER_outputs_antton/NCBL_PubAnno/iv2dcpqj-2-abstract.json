However , the NS5A - interacting cellular proteins engaged in the CSFV replication are poorly defined . Using yeast two - hybrid screen , the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A ( eEF1A ) was identified to be an NS5A - binding partner . The NS5A - eEF1A interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays . The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A - eEF1A interaction . Overexpression of eEF1A suppressed the CSFV growth markedly , and conversely , knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the CSFV replication significantly . Furthermore , eEF1A , as well as NS5A , was found to reduce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) of CSFV in a dose - dependent manner , as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay . Streptavidin pulldown assay revealed that eEF1A could bind to the CSFV IRES . Collectively , our results suggest that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively regulates the growth of CSFV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 48}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
