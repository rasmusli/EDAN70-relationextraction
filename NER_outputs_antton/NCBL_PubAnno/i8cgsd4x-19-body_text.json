Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 and infected with WNV at 24 h post - transfection . Total cell lysates were collected at 24 hours post - infection and Western blot was performed using anti - CxSTAT antibody . As a control , cells were either transfected with GFP dsRNA ( Control ) . The results ( Fig 5C ) showed cells infected with WNV showed decreased CxSTAT levels , which returned to baseline in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 . Although , we cannot rule out the possibility that reduced degradation of CxSTAT upon CxCul4 knockdown is due to lower virus replication , these results combined with other data indicate that WNV infection leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 176}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 459}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 764}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
