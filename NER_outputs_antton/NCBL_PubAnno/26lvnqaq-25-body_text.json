E . coli , Gallibacterium spp . , Enterococcus spp . , Streptococccus spp . , Pseudomonas spp . ) . Moreover , specific PCRs for Mycoplasma synoviae and galllisepticum were performed from oviducts in order to rule out the onset of abnormal eggs due to mycoplasma infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 274}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 598, "end": 619}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
