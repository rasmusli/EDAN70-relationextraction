Sepsis , bacterial pneumonia , polytrauma , and aspiration pneumonia are the most common causes of ARDS [ 1 ] . Predictors of survival include age , the type of underlying medical condition , the severity of pulmonary injury , the presence of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction , and ongoing sepsis [ 2 ] . Currently , clinical attempts to rescue ARDS patients include individualized ventilation and fluid management , adequate infection control , including early application of broad - spectrum anti - infectives , neuromuscular blockade using cisatracurium , sedation strategies , prone positioning , and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) to ensure oxygenation [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Although the incidence of ARDS is relatively high , with five to eight cases per 100 , 000 European inhabitants and even more in the USA , the various pathomechanisms are only partially understood , resulting in different experimental approaches to understand immune responses during early ARDS [ 6 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 36}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 43}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 156}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 158, "end": 178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 248, "end": 253}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 374}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 425}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 446}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 499}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 880}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1139, "end": 1144}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
