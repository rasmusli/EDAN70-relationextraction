NS3 contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of HCV infection , particularly in early HCV infection ( 21 ) . In this study , to our knowledge , our results demonstrate for the first time that a new NS3 segment ( 1183 - 1476 aa ) shows strong reactivity in 95 . 6 % of RT - PCRpositive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of HCV infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 208}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 506}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
