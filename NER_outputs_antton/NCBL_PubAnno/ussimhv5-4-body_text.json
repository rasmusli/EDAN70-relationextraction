Our results showed that only FPLV was detected in the samples . The filtered homogenates of positive intestinal samples were used to inoculate a Crandell - Rees feline kidney cell monolayer as described previously . 6 , 7 Cytopathogenic effects were observed in infected Crandell - Rees feline kidney cells beginning 36 h post inoculation ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The presence of parvovirus in the supernatant of the cell cultures was confirmed by PCR . An FPLV strain , designated HN - ZZ1 , was purified from the supernatant of the cell cultures by plaque assay , and the viral genome was sequenced by the Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Company . The full - length genome of HN - ZZ1 comprises 4688 nucleotides ( nt ) and has been deposited in GenBank ( accession number KX685354 . 1 ) . Bioinformatic analysis of the viral sequence predicted that the HN - ZZ1 isolate encodes four proteins , including two nonstructural proteins , NS1 ( nt 114 - 2120 ) and NS2 ( nt 114 - 373 and 1846 - 2083 ) , and two structural proteins , VP1 ( nt 2127 - 2158 and 2223 - 4382 ) and VP2 ( nt 2628 - 4382 ) . The nucleotide sequence of HN - ZZ1 is closely related to viruses previously isolated from domestic cats in China and shows the highest identity ( 99 . 2 % ) with FPLV strain HRB - CS1 , which was isolated from a dead domestic cat with enteritis in 2014 in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China . Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome of the HN - ZZ1 strain and 25 reference strains ( Supplementary Table S1 ) showed that HN - ZZ1 was clustered in the FPLV branch but was also closely related to the CPV branch ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 83}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 95}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 210}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 713}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1654, "end": 1664}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
