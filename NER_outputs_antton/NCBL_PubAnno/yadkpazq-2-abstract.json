Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries , where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts . Oligonucleotides ( ODN ) containing cytosine - phosphate - guanosine motifs of class A ( CpG - A ) are highly potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms . The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand - alone agents in the domestic cat . CpG - A stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) enhanced their proliferation , increased the presence of co - stimulatory molecules on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation . Incubation of the supernatants of CpG - A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the antiviral myxovirus resistance ( Mx ) gene in these target cells , which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families , namely Coronaviridae , Herpesviridae , Caliciviridae , Parvoviridae , and Retroviridae . Most importantly , subcutaneous administration of CpG - A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of Mx , reaching maximal levels within 24 h . Plasma from treated cats could furthermore inhibit viral replication in vitro . Altogether , our data highlight the promising potential of CpG - A to induce a preventive antiviral state in the cat and to protect feline populations against a broad range of virus infections .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1641, "end": 1647}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
