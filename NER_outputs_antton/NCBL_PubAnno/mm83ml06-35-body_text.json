This might interfere with the function of the ESCRT - complex as early acting ESCRT factors like ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , and ALG - 2 interacting protein X ( ALIX ) possess ubiquitin binding domains , and thus ubiquitin may play an important role in their substrate recognition [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] . Second , the addition of DIs together with proteasome inhibitors might lead to the accumulation of so - called defective ribosomal products ( DRiPs ) . DRiPs are de novo synthesized erroneous proteins , which are rapidly degraded via the UPS . Originally , it was shown that the HIV - 1 Gag protein is a bona fide substrate for the DRiP - pathway [ 94 ] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of DRiPs [ 38 ] . Combinatory treatment of cells with DIs might lead to a further enhancement of accumulated Gag - DRiPs within the cell . Thereby , those Gag - DRiPs interfere with virus release by disturbing the highly ordered assembly of Gag molecules in a prion - like manner [ 38 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
