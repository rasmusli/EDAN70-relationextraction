For pneumonia , only obese subjects had a higher prevalence . The overweight group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and obesity ( Table 3 ) . The strongest association was seen for pneumonia and bronchitis , and accordingly , any LRTI was more strongly associated with obesity than any URTI . Long - lasting RTIs , frequent RTIs and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with obesity than the individual symptoms . Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates . Among subjects with an infection , long lasting infections were again associated with obesity , reaching significance for any RTI , rhinitis , pharyngitis / laryngitis , influenza - like illness , and bronchitis ( Table 3 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 51}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 55, "end": 61}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 137}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 236}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 250}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 274, "end": 284}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 297}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 347}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 420, "end": 428}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 491}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 495, "end": 506}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 535}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 577}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 591}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 613}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 629}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 699}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 902}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 934, "end": 938}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 940, "end": 949}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 951, "end": 963}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 965, "end": 976}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
