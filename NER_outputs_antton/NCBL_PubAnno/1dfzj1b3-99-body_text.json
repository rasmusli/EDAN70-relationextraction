NF - \u03baB is maintained as a latent form in the cytoplasm of cells where it is complexed to I\u03baB inhibitor protein . Seven members of the I\u03baB family of proteins have been identified and includes I\u03baB - \u03b1 . Upon activation of NF - \u03baB , I\u03baB - \u03b1 is phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinases ( IKK ) leading to proteasome - dependent degradation of I\u03baB , which allows a rapid translocation of NF - \u03baB into the nucleus where it binds to DNA . The most predominant NF - \u03baB dimmer activated is p65 : p50 . Translocation of p65 : p50 to the nucleus results in the transcription of several proinflammatory genes , such as cytokines ( TNF - \u03b1 , IL - 1\u03b2 , IL - 6 ) and inducible enzymes ( iNOS and COX - 2 ) [ 127 , 128 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
