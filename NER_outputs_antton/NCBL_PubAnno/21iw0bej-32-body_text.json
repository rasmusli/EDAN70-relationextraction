Although EV - D68 was first identified in California in 1962 , the number of people in one breakout in 2014 with confirmed EV - D68 infection was much greater than the number reported in previous years ( http : / / www . cdc . gov / non - polio - enterovirus / about / ev - d68 . html ) . It is hard to predict whether EV - D68 will emerge again in future outbreaks , but the value of resolving the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 is obvious . In this study , we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of EV - D68 to reveal the relationship between virus infection and the host cell cycle .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 78}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 101}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 112}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 143}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 154}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 177}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 385}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 502}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
