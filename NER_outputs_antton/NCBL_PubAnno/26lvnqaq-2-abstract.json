In this study , we investigated the importance of the G1 - lineage H9N2 A / chicken / Israel / 1163 / 2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers , analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues , and investigating the long - term impact on egg production . Besides causing a mild respiratory infection , the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60 % of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ , in particular at the level of the infundibulum , where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate , and necrosis of the epithelium . Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct . The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post - infection ( pi ) ( 60 % decrease ) and continued up to 80 days pi ( 35 % decrease ) . On day 80 pi , non - laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis , and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture , duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium , while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal . Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens , and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct , compromising the commercial life of birds .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 177}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 597, "end": 619}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 718}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 874}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 907}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1200, "end": 1221}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1332}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1336, "end": 1363}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
