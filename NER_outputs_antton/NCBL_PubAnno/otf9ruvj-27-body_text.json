Therefore , IVIG treatment could be a logical requirement in these patients . We included IVIG therapy in our ARDS patients based on these considerations , although we did not measure immunoglobulin levels before treatment . Indeed , in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients , high IgG levels were associated with high mortality in sepsis patients [ 18 ] . PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to IgM in the blood of patients with sepsis [ 19 ] . IgM levels remain low in non - surviving sepsis patients , whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [ 20 ] . Single studies and metaanalyses have shown beneficial effects of IVIG therapy in patients with sepsis [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . However , IVIG treatment remains controversial . Randomized studies have not shown any beneficial effect of this intervention in patients with sepsis or sepsis - associated conditions [ 8 ] . Therefore , IVIG therapy is not currently recommended in the latest sepsis guidelines [ 24 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 43}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 150}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 283}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 517}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 627}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 684}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 861, "end": 868}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1034, "end": 1041}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1075}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1158}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
