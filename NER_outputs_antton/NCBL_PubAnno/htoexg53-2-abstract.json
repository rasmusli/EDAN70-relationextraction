Antibodies directed against the MERS - CoV spike ( S ) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS - CoV infection and in mediating vaccine - induced protective immunity . In contrast , relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS - CoV that are recognized by CD8 + T cells . In this study , the highly conserved MERS - CoV nucleocapsid ( N ) protein served as a target immunogen to elicit MERS - CoV - specific cellular immune responses . Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , a safety - tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research , was used for generating MVA - MERS - N expressing recombinant N protein .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 58}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 122}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 306}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
