The former encodes the Barnase gene that give rise to male sterility , which is replaced in the latter by the Barstar gene which restores fertility : both also have the selectable marker bar which confers tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium . Though the left border of the RF3 insert has undergone rearrangement in the form of duplication and inversion [ 5 ] , the right borders of both events are relatively intact ( our data [ 6 ] which agree with the two sequences in the database ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 218}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
