Using cDNA arrays , Klein et al . [ 77 ] identified nearly 2000 genes that were differentially expressed in male and female rats infected with SEOV . Many immune - associated transcription factors , proinflammatory , antiviral , T cell and Ig family member genes were significantly higher in females , which may reduce transmission from females .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 141}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 299}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
