{"cord_uid": "89pf7c5i", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4462189", "divid": "2", "text": "Limited data is available on feline leishmaniosis ( FeL ) caused by Leishmania infantum worldwide . The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL , the epidemiological role of the cat in L . infantum infection , clinical manifestations , and recommendations on diagnosis , treatment and monitoring , prognosis and prevention of infection , in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats . The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence - based studies and case reports , clinical experience and critical consensus discussions . While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis , clinical illness due to L . infantum in cats is rare . The prevalence rates of feline infection with L . infantum in serological or molecular - based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 % . Cats are able to infect sand flies and , therefore , they may act as a secondary reservoir , with dogs being the primary natural reservoir . The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative , exfoliative , crusting or nodular dermatitis ( mainly on the head or distal limbs ) , ocular lesions ( mainly uveitis ) , feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome , mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions , hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia . Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence , as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy . Diagnosis is based on serology , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , cytology , histology , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) or culture . If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL , the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods ( cytology , histology with IHC , PCR , culture ) should be employed . The most common treatment used is allopurinol . Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases . Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy . Follow - up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests , serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses . Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 50}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 56}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 184}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 238}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 712, "end": 733}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 772}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 849}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1104, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1158}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1172}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1193, "end": 1206}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1214, "end": 1272}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1313, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1345}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1356, "end": 1391}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1437}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1439, "end": 1463}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1472, "end": 1504}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1880, "end": 1884}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1903, "end": 1917}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
