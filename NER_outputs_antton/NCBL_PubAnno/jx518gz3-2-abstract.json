Epidemic outbreaks have been occurring in Southeast Asia , with the most recent in 2010 . Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the HPAI outbreaks in these countries remains elusive . Our studies strongly suggested that field and laboratory studies focusing on mechanical transmission by blow flies should be considered to control H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks , in particular in epidemic areas , where there are high densities of different fly species throughout the year . In this paper , we review these field and laboratory entomological studies and discuss the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 viruses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 55}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 62}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 287}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 502}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
