A member of the Flavivirus genus , WNV is an enveloped , single - stranded positive sense RNA virus that cycles between birds and mosquitos . Symptoms of WNV infection can range from a relatively mild flu - like illness , West Nile fever , to severe neuroinvasive disease . After peripheral infection , WNV replicates within lymphoid tissues before entering the CNS , where it targets neurons in the cerebellum , brainstem , and cerebral cortex [ 2 , 3 ] . In 2017 , 2002 symptomatic WNV cases were reported to the CDC , and of those , 1339 ( 67 % ) were classified as neuroinvasive [ 4 ] . Prolonged neurological deficits , which include motor functions , verbal learning and memory , and executive functions , are a significant problem for survivors of WNV infection and appear to manifest even in cases where neuroinvasion is absent [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 16}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 22}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 182}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 194}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 313}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 375}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 393}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 427}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 639, "end": 643}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 924}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
