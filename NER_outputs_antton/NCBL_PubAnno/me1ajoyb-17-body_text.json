The expression of immune response genes differed in the spleen , where signatures of inflammation occurred within two days , peaking by days 10 to 15 before subsiding , and lungs , where little immune gene expression occurred [ 13 ] . Some deer mice produced nucleocapsid - specific IgG by day 10 while others had IgG around day 20 or later , and neutralizing antibody was not detected until after 3 weeks . . During acute infection , SNV elicits a modest inflammatory response that initially limits , but does not clear , virus . Within a few weeks , the response transitions to a regulatory response that may allow episodic recrudescence of virus that can be shed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 691, "end": 695}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
