Mice were challenged with PRV by intramuscular injection ( 10 LD 50 ) . Survival rates in each group were calculated at 12 hr intervals ( Figure S5 ) . Tissues ( muscle and brain ) were harvested and stored at 270uC for further RT - PCR and immunohistochemical analyses .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 115}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 229}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
