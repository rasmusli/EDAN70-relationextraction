The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 16 , 000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0 C . Protein samples ( 10 \u03bcg ) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels ( 4 - 12 % ) . After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes , proteins were blotted using anti - Culex STAT ( rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC ) , anti - WNV NS1 , anti - WNV NS5 [ 58 ] or anti - V5 ( Invitrogen ) antibody followed by anti - rabbit or anti - mouse secondary antibodies . After adding substrate , the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels . Anti - \u03b2 - actin antibody ( Abcam ) was used in immunoblots as a loading control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
