[ 41 ] , done on captive large flying foxes ( also known as Malayan flying fox ; Pteropus vampyrus ) , showed the possibility of recrudescence of Nipah virus ( NiV ) . Regular sampling was done for over a period of one year to study the presence of virus and level of antibody against it . The authors discovered that one bat had a waning antibody titer with subsequent detection of virus in the urine . Following virus shedding , the antibody levels increased in this animal . As virus was undetectable in earlier samples of the same bat , the authors suggest that the virus may have persisted , probably in certain organs or cells , rendering it undetectable in blood , throat swab or urine . Within two weeks after NiV was isolated from the bat , two other male bats seroconverted and demonstrated an increase in antibody titers , suggesting that recrudescence led to horizontal transmission .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 191}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
