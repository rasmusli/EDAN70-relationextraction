To address this issue , HeLa cells were co - transfected with HA - tagged ubiquitin ( HA - Ub ) and syngag expression plasmids , and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs . The [UNK] PTAP mutant , which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag , was assessed in parallel [ 25 , 30 ] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment , cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG - 132 and Lactacystin ( LC ) 4 h prior to cell lysis . After immunoprecipitation with Gag - specific antibodies , western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti - HA staining ( Figure 8 ) . Following co - expression of syngag wt and HA - Ub , a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed , which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag . Upon treatment with 14 \u00b5M PR - 619 or 20 \u00b5M P22077 , the intensity of the HA - Ub - signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination - levels of the [UNK] PTAP mutant . Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti - CA staining . Thus , treatment with P22077 or PR - 619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
