{"cord_uid": "26lvnqaq", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6116506", "divid": "73", "text": "In the field , egg peritonitis is often considered of multifactorial etiology and one of the most important causes of mortality in layers and breeders [ 36 ] . Overfeeding , stress , genetics and improper lighting may all determine the occurrence of this syndrome , but in some cases , single factors such as viral infections of the reproductive tract ( e . g . infectious bronchitis , Newcastle disease , HPAI viruses ) can trigger the disease regardless of other managerial issues [ 37 ] . If bacterial agents as E . coli gain access to the peritoneum , either via reverse peristalsis along the oviduct or crossing of the intestinal barrier [ 38 ] , the peritonitis becomes septic and more likely to bring the animal to a severe pathological state including lethargy , ascites , abdominal swelling and weight loss . In light of this , and considering the good health status of birds at the end of the study , together with the granulomatous peritonitis and the altered architecture of the infundibulum , we speculate that the presence of yolk in the abdomen was the result of erratic oviposition [ 37 ] due to a chronic damage of the oviduct . According to these evidences , the observed pathological picture could fall under the definition of non - septic egg peritonitis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 31}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 352}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 384}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 404}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 419}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 656, "end": 668}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 769}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 779}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 781, "end": 800}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 816}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 929, "end": 955}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1275}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
