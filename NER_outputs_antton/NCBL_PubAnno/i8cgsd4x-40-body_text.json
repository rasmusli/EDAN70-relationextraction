Mosquitoes were blood - fed with WNV ( 1 . 13 \u00d7 10 ^ 6 pfu / ml ) one day later and were maintained in a diurnal cycle ( 23 / 26 \u00b0 C ) in an environmental cabinet . At 10 - 12 days post - infection , saliva was collected in capillary tubes containing 5 \u03bcl FCS for 10 min using a protocol described previously [ 61 ] . Midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead - beater . RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from the midgut and carcass of individual mosquitoes and was used for real - time RTqPCR as described above . Saliva from each mosquito was diluted in 300 \u03bcl of L - 15 medium and was used to determine viral titer by plaque assay as described above .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
