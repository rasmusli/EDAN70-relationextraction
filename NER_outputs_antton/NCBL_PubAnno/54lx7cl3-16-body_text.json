In a cross - sectional analysis of aboriginal and non - aboriginal children in Western Australia , Jacoby et al . [ 18 ] observed positive associations between rhinovirus and S . pneumoniae , H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis and a positive association [ 48 ] between adenovirus and M . catarrhalis in the nasopharynx . In a US study , children with a viral URT co - infection not associated with otitis media had a higher prevalence of nontypeable H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis relative to healthy children . Furthermore , children with viral co - infection associated with acute otitis media had an increased prevalence of S . pneumoniae , nontypeable H . influenzae and M . catarrhalis but a decreased prevalence of a - hemolytic Streptococci [ 77 ] . van den Bergh et al . [ 26 ] assessed the prevalence of 20 respiratory viruses and the main commensal bacteria in the nasopharynx of 433 healthy Dutch children aged 6 - 24 months . In their study , rhinovirus was positively associated with S . pneumoniae and H . influenzae , RSV was positively associated with H . influenzae , coronaviruses and adenovirus were positively associated with M . catarrhalis , and influenza virus was positively associated S . aureus ( Fig . 2 ) . However , as the associations found in the above - mentioned studies are based on cross - sectional analyses , we cannot determine whether viruses influenced carriage structure , bacterial carriage influenced host susceptibility to viruses or if bidirectional interactions occurred . Prospective studies are required to resolve this temporal ambiguity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 45}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 120}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 343, "end": 345}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 418}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 495}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 543}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 617}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 732}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 857, "end": 884}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1282, "end": 1284}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
