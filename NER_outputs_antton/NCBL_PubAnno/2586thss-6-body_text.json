To obtain the HCV antigens , the sequences encoding the desired A novel double antibody sandwich - lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid and simple detection of hepatitis C virus regions in the HCV genome were amplified by RT - PCR , and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vectors , pQE30 ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , pET32a ( + ) ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) , or pGEX - 4T - 2 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Chalfont St . Giles , UK ) , in - frame downstream of the 6 - His - tag or glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tag coding sequence . Primers used for the HCV PCR amplification are listed in Table I and the structures of the plasmids are illustrated in Fig . 1 . E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells harbouring the HCV gene fragment were grown at 37 [UNK] C in LB medium containing 50 \u00b5g / ml of ampicillin to OD 600 = 0 . 8 . The expression of the antigens was induced by adding isopropyl\u03b2 - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) to a final concentration of 1 mmol / l . The cells were harvested 4 - 6 h later by centrifugation at 10 , 000 rpm for 15 min and stored at - 20 [UNK] C . Solubility analyses of expression products were performed as previously described ( 14 ) . Briefly , harvested bacteria were re - suspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; containing 140 mmol / l NaCl , 2 . 7 mmol / l KCl , 10 mmol / l Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mmol / l KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 3 ) , sonicated on an ice - bath , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 [UNK] C . After centrifugation , the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of expression products .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 232}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 789, "end": 793}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
