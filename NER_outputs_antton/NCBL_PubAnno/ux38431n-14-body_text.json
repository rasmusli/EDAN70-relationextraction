A total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparisons with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank ( S1 Table ) . These were aligned and manually adjusted using Clustal X2 and BioEdit . The phylogenetic tree was drawn based on the hexon region of adenovirus by the neighbourjoining ( NJ ) method using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis ( MEGA ) software version 5 . 0 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
