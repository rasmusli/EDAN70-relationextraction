Previously , we generated 4 murine monoclonal antibodies that cross - neutralized subgenogroup B isolates of EV71 in vitro . Therefore , we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model . Here we show that by using N3 , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD - like and paralytic symptoms . We concluded that treatment of N3 ( 200 mg ) at an early stage ( 3 h post infection ) after infection afforded complete protection . A lower dose ( 70 mg ) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90 % protection . The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection , even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis . This suggested that the protection conferred by N3 is in a dose and time - dependent manner .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 100}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 134}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 153}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 189}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 610}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
