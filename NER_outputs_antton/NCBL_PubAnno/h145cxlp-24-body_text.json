During the postpandemic seasons 1 / 2 / 3 , the proportion of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 cases among the PICU patients was 79 % / 14 % / 65 % and , thus , considerably higher than the proportion of this subtype reported among outpatients by national influenza surveillance ( 65 % / 1 % / 34 % ) [ 17 ] . This observation suggests that A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 may be associated more often with a severe course of influenza requiring PICU treatment than other influenza types / subtypes . Similar observations on the proportion of A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 - associated PICU admissions have been reported in the United States [ 9 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 47}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 209}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 504, "end": 514}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 656}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
