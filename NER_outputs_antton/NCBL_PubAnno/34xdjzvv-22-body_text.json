NHRI - IACUC - 101006 - A ) . 5746 - TW98 ( C2 ) strain elicits a lethal neurological virulence of hind limb paralysis ( HLP ) and E59 ( B4 ) can induce HFMD - like hair loss associated with scurf ( HLS ) and a non - lethal HLP in hSCARB2 - transgenic mice [ 11 ] . In the protection of C2 EV71challenge , survival rate was used as one of end points to assess the protective efficacy of anti - EV71 medication . Survival rate used as an index of pathogenesis of EV71 infection in experimental animal models has been reported by many studies [ 5 , 6 , 8 , 11 ] . In B4 challenge test , scoring of mice with HLS and HLP was performed . After the investigation or when weight loss of 20 % occurred , tested animals were euthanasia by 100 % CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation to minimize the animals suffering . To perform virus challenge , mice were explored in the anesthetic inhalator chamber containing isoflurane ( For initial phase : 5 % , for maintainced phase : 1 . 5 % , 2 . 5 % ) for 1 minutes before subcutaneously or intraperitoneally immunized with EV71 or antibody , respectively .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 174}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 180}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 213}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 220, "end": 230}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 252}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 258}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 283}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 532}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 661, "end": 665}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 669, "end": 673}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 854}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
