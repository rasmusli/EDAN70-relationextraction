The canonical function of eEF1A is to bind aminoacyl - tRNA ( aa - tRNA ) in a GTP - dependent manner and deliver it to the A site on the ribosome during protein synthesis [ 18 ] . eEF1A is also involved in non - canonical functions including turnover of misfolded proteins , nuclear export events , binding and bundling of the actin cytoskeleton , apoptosis and the viral life cycle [ 19 , 20 ] . eEF1A contains three well - defined domains : the domain I binds to GTP ; the domain II binds to the aminoacyl end of aa - tRNA , the domains I and II bind to the eEF1B complex , and the domain III is linked to actin binding [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
