Acute hepatitis occurs between 2 - 5 months after transplant , and it is characterized by acute lobular hepatitis [ 4 ] . In the early reinfection stage , the graft injury occurs only after 3 weeks . Chronic hepatitis is established about 6 - 12 months after transplantation . The stage of chronic hepatitis is characterized by a decrease of viral load and a pattern of immune - mediated injury . A variant form of posttransplant HCV infection is cholestatic hepatitis C that occurs in < 10 % of patients , frequently associated with high viral load and immunosuppression . Usually , it occurs within 1 - 6 months after transplant and can progress to hepatic failure in 3 - 6 months [ 6 ] . This form is characterized by very high viral load , cellular ballooning , low inflammation , and a Th2 intrahepatic immunological response . These features suggest that the liver lesion is due to a direct cytopathic injury caused by HCV .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 168}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 266}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 317}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 370}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 460}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 547}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 596}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 623}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 819}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1030}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1067}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1077, "end": 1081}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
