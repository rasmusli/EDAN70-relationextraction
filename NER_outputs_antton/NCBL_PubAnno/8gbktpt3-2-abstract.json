We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of FPL between 2014 and 2018 in Australia , New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) where FPL outbreaks had not been reported for several decades . Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved . Most cats with FPL were shelter - housed , 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis , unvaccinated , had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines . Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV , with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations . Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin . FPV vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases , highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co - incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats . Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter - housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks , likely precipitating the multiple re - emergence of infection events .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 21}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 27}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 101, "end": 105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 128}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 134}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 184}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 280}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 516}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 767}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 792}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 800, "end": 804}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 891, "end": 895}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1083}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
