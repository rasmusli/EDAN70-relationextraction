Briefly , the cells were transfected with 400 \u00b5L of serum - free DMEM containing 8 \u00b5g of plasmids and 12 \u00b5L of X - tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent . At 6 h post - transfection ( hpt ) , the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and incubated for an additional 48 h before being assayed .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
