{"cord_uid": "vgfdfuza", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC6963657", "divid": "62", "text": "First , it is important to understand how AMR has been socially constructed in Singapore and how power relations operate between the different stakeholders . Wernli et al . distinguished five different frames that map the global policy discourse on AMR [ 26 ] . These are : a One Health approach combining in one paradigm human , animal , and environment health ; a health security threat giving rise to the global health security agenda ; a healthcare policy issue with the dominance of the medical profession ; a development issue where it is considered that low - and - middle income countries drive AMR ; and an innovation issue with a focus on new diagnostics and antibiotics . Wernli et al . also distinguish a set of actors and policies for each of the frames described . In the Singaporean context , it is interesting to note that several frames coexist with their respective actors leading the selected frame . First , it was reported that there is a One Health platform where all stakeholders meet . Second , there is a strong healthcare policy frame as it was reported that Singapore ' s AMR policies were largely driven by a group of infectious disease clinicians . Third , AMR is also seen as an innovation issue where researchers are working to identify novel solutions on all fronts . The results of this study suggest that a deeper understanding is needed of the different power relations between these distinct groups to ensure the successful implementation of policies designed to respond to the threat of resistance . However , from our participants ' responses we can tentatively conclude that AMR is predominantly seen as a biomedical problem within the context of healthcare facilities and within the pursuit of clinicians controlling infectious diseases even when they still participate in the One Health platform . It could also be argued that historically the emphasis on AMR has been biomedical because this is where the health burden was seen and therefore where the expertise developed . This , however , does not mean that other areas are not seen as important .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 46}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 253}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 603, "end": 607}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1099, "end": 1103}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1146, "end": 1165}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1190}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1614, "end": 1618}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1757, "end": 1777}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1897, "end": 1901}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
