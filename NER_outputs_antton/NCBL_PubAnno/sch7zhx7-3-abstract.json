Polyamines function in nucleotide metabolism , cell cycling , and cell signaling , among several other functions [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . Several compounds have been developed that specifically target polyamine metabolism , either by reducing their synthesis or enhancing their breakdown , and these compounds have been tested clinically for the treatment of cancers and parasites [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO ) , which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis , has received attention as an anti - trypanosomal molecule and is well - tolerated in patients [ 22 , 23 ] . Polyamines are also crucial for RNA virus infection , including CVB3 [ 24 ] . Polyamine depletion via DFMO restricts CVB3 infection , in vitro and in vivo [ 25 ] . We previously described how Chikungunya and Zika viruses rely on polyamines for viral translation and genome replication [ 26 ] ; however , whether similar processes are affected for other viruses and precisely how polyamines function during CVB3 replication remain to be completely understood .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 459}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 711, "end": 731}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 801}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 900}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
