MDM were generated from monocytes as previously described ( 70 ) . To this end , blood from 6 - to 24 - month - old specific - pathogen - free ( SPF ) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated using density centrifugation ( 1 . 077 g / liter ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting with an LS column ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) as CD172a [UNK] cells using monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) clone 74 - 22 - 15 ( ATCC ) . Sorted monocytes were seeded at 5 [UNK] 10 5 / ml in DMEM - 10 % FBS and porcine macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ; 20 U / ml , produced in - house [ 70 , 71 ] ) and cultured for 3 days at 39 \u00b0 C and 5 % CO 2 . After MDM differentiation , medium was replaced with fresh MDM ( for nonpolarized MDM ) or with medium supplemented with IL - 4 ( 100 U / ml , produced in - house ; for IL - 4 - polarized MDM ) ( 72 , 73 ) and incubated for another 24 h .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
