A validated cut off value of 1 : 80 has been recommended in cats tested by this serological technique and the serum antibody level to Leishmania antigen ranged from low to high positive levels in clinical cases of FeL [ 24 ] . Quantitative enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) are also frequently employed and seems to be more sensitive than IFAT [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] . The direct agglutination test ( DAT ) was found less sensitive than IFAT [ 27 ] or ELISA [ 23 ] and western blot ( WB ) was more sensitive than IFAT [ 83 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
