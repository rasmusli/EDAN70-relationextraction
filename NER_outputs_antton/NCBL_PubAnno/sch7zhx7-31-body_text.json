We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression . These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO . Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity . We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ) , protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment , to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 \u00b5M . These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity , and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
