Mino et al . delivered artificial zinc - finger proteins ( AZPs ) into cultured cells by expressing AZPs in fusion with the 9R peptide . These AZP - 9R conjugates strongly inhibited HPV - 18 replication to 3 % at 250 nM while gene - delivered AZP only achieved 12 % inhibition . PTD4 conjugates were also tested but proved to be less effective than AZPs fused to 9R .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 225}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 273}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 320}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 452}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 522}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 534}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
