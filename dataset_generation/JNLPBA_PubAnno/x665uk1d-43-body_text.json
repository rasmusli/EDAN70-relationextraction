Anti - PRV gpD antibody ( Jeno Biotech Inc . ) was used as the primary antibody ( 1 : 100 ) and was applied for 60 min at RT . The samples were then treated for color development with the DAB Detection Kit ( Ventana Medical Systems , Germany ) . The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and delivers the viral capsid into the cytoplasm . Viral DNA synthesis begins shortly after the appearance of the beta proteins and the temporal program of viral gene expression ends with the appearance of the gamma or late proteins , which constitute the structural proteins of the virus . Finally , the virus undergoes a lytic cycle . B . Expression model of 3D8 scFv proteins . 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in cytosol using a vector system and targeted in the nucleus by nuclear localization signal . Therefore , 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 were present in both the cytosol and nucleus . C . 3D8 scFv has a unique dual and stereoscopic protection mechanism that includes DNase activity in the nucleus and RNase activity in the cytoplasm . 3D8 scFv acts by inhibiting ( 1 )", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 484}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 582}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 616}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 687}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 815, "end": 833}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 835, "end": 853}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 992}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1051, "end": 1064}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1140}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1168, "end": 1174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1211}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
