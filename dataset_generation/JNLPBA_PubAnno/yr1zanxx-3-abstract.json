These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism , which has been investigated as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative conditions , in which neuroinflammation is a contributing factor .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 58}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 307}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
