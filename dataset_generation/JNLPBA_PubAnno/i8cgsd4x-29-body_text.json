RNA was quantified and checked for quality using a bioanalyser . The experiment was conducted in duplicate with two RNA - Seq libraries generated for WNV - infected cells and two for uninfected control cells . Sequencing was conducted in a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 ( Micromon Facility , Monash University , Australia ) , generating more than 80 million reads per sample ( S1 Table ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 254, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 415}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
