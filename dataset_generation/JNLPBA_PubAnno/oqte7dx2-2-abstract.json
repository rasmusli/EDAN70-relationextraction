Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse , however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins . Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome , it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions , suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo . Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes , and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression , localization and catalytic activity of DUBs . In this review article , we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system , and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40 - repeat ( WDR ) proteins , WDR48 / UAF1 and WDR20 , based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 56}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 168, "end": 186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 356}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 379}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 407}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 440}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 501, "end": 505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 555}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 600}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 715}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 780}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 854, "end": 859}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 877, "end": 883}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 934}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 949}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 959}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
