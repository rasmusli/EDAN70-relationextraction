Our observations and those of others on the effects of exogenous expression of RNase ( Pac1 and ISG20 ) and / or nuclease ( 3D8 scFv ) indicate that it is possible to develop transgenic plants and animal cells and even entire organisms that are virus - resistant . However , host RNA could be degraded nonselectively by 3D8 scFv RNase activity in 3D8 scFv - expressing cells . During the transformation process , antiviral transgenic cell lines or organisms can be developed if ( 1 ) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein expressed does not inhibit the physiological and developmental processes of cells or organisms , and ( 2 ) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein produced is sufficient to protect against virus infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 5}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 15}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 34}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 82}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 247}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 257}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 277}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 288}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 490}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 653, "end": 670}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 808}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
