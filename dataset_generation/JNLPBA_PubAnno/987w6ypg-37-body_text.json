Single - cycle infection - competent viruses were produced by co - transfection of 3 DNAs coding Gag - Pol , a miniviral genome coding GFP and Env ( for a 10 cm plate : 4 , 4 and 1 \u03bcg each , respectively ) and IFITMs were added at a Gag - Pol / IFITMs ratio of 1 to 3 . When indicated , this ratio was lowered to 1 to 0 , 07 by modifying the amount of IFITM transfected for a constant amount of Gag - Pol and Env coding DNAs . Media was replaced 12 hours after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after . Supernatants were first centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 10 minutes , then filtered through a 0 , 45 \u03bcm syringe - filter , prior to purification by ultracentrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 2 hours through a 25 % ( w / v ) sucrose cushion . After ultracentrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and normalized by either exogenous - RT activity or by an in - house anti - p24 ELISA , as described [ 39 ] . Viral infectivity was determined 3 days after cell challenge by flow cytometry analysis ( in the case of GFP - coding vectors ) or 24 hours PI by \u03b2 - gal assay in HeLaP4 cells ( stably expressing the CD4 / CXCR4 receptors plus an HIV - 1 - LTR - \u03b2 - gal reporter cassette , obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland ) with replicationcompetent HIV - 1 . The Env - Gag ratio of viral particles produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs was carried out by gp120 and p24 ELISA , as described [ 53 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 295}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 314}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 410}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 412, "end": 419}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 525}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 592}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1076}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1232}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1256}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1306, "end": 1328}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1336, "end": 1378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1502, "end": 1508}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1572, "end": 1579}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
