{"cord_uid": "yadkpazq", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3537549", "divid": "13", "text": "PBMCs were stimulated with ODN 2216 , ODN 2243 or endotoxin - free PBS at a density of 3 \u00d7 10 6 cells / mL directly after isolation , while CrFK , FEA or fcwf - 4 cells were cultured to confluency prior to stimulation . Experiments were carried out in a 96 - well format . For stimulation of adherent cells with supernatants ( production see below ) , total cell culture medium was discarded from the wells and the monolayers were further cultured in 100 \u03bcL undiluted supernatants for the rest of the experiment . At time points relevant to each experiment , the supernatants were removed and cells were lysed with mRNA lysis buffer ( mRNA isolation kit I , Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . mRNA extractions were performed with the mRNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument ( Roche Diagnostics ) and first strand cDNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) reactions consisted of 5 \u03bcL cDNA in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL per reaction using the TaqMan \u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . Thermocycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 20 s at 95 \u00b0 C followed by 45 cycles of amplification by melting at 95 \u00b0 C for 3 s and annealing at 60 \u00b0 C for 45 s . Primers and probes for feline genes have been previously described [ 58 ] . mRNA expression factors of selected genes , which correspond to ratios of mRNA levels measured in ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 stimulated versus PBS stimulated cells , were calculated and normalized with GeNorm version 3 . 5 [ 59 ] , using either both feline \u03b2 - glucuronidase ( GUSB ) and tryptophan 5 - monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide ( YWHAZ ) ( usually ) or Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) alone ( when specified ) as reference genes , under conditions validated for the feline species [ 60 ] . Generally depicted in the graphs are mean expression factors calculated from duplicate experiments carried out simultaneously . Where results of one cat are illustrated , experiments were conducted with cells of at least 3 individual animals and representative data is shown .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 710}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 777}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 835, "end": 840}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 884}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1031}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1105, "end": 1109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1347, "end": 1360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1400, "end": 1424}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1436, "end": 1442}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1644, "end": 1669}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1671, "end": 1676}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1682, "end": 1747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1749, "end": 1755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1772, "end": 1815}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1817, "end": 1823}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
