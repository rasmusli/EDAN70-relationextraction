{"cord_uid": "oqte7dx2", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5735123", "divid": "10", "text": "Several experiments suggest that USP46 loss - offunction affects the GABAergic system . First , hippocampal immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of the GABA synthesis enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD67 ) in USP46 ( K92 ) mutants ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that USP46 may regulate GABA synthesis . Second , muscimol - induced postsynaptic GABA A receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of USP46 ( K92 ) mutants . This effect may be mediated by extrasynaptic GABA A receptors since no alterations were observed in mIPSC amplitude or frequency ( Tomida et al . , 2009 ) . Third , administration of the GABA A receptor agonist , nitrazepam , restores depression - like behavior in USP46 ( K92 ) and KO mutant mice , and these effects could be blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist flumazenil ( Imai et al . , 2012 ) . Together , these data suggest that USP46 affects both preand postsynaptic components of the GABA system , however the precise mechanism is not known . One possibility is that USP46 may indirectly affect the GABA system as a compensatory response to a primary defect in AMPAR degradation in excitatory neurons . It will be important in the future to test if USP46 functions in GABA neurons and whether it directly deubiquitinates components of the GABA system .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 212}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 220}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 239}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 291, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 375}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 455}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 527}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 652, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 736}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 807, "end": 823}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 912}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1052}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1140, "end": 1146}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1228, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
