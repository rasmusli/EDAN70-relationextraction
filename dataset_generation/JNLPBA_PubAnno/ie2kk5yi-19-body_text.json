Low complexity reads were filtered out using the DUST method and PCR duplicates removed using PRINSEQ [ 65 ] . We screened cleaned reads for the Bartonella genotypes detected in this study using nucleotide BLAST [ 66 ] against a custom database composed of the PCR - generated Bartonella sequences from this study , retaining only the best alignment ( the high - scoring segment pair with the lowest e - value ) for a single query - subject pair . To investigate the presence of Bartonella species other than genotypes detected in blood samples from vampire bats , cleaned reads were de novo assembled into contigs using the assembly only function of SPAdes [ 67 ] . Individual reads and contigs were screened for sequences matching Bartonella using protein alignment in Diamond [ 68 ] , and close matches at the protein level were further characterized by nucleotide BLAST against the Genbank nt database . As the gltA gene is not highly transcribed , we also tested sequences for matches to Bartonella DNAdirected RNA polymerase subunit B ( rpoB ) . We selected two rpoB sequences ( Genbank accessions KY629892 and KY629911 ) from a study of vampire bat Bartonella [ 16 ] for which the same individuals exhibited 100 % identity in the gltA gene to our blood sequences , and we used Bowtie2 to map quality filtered reads and contigs to those sequences [ 69 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 501}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 587}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 854, "end": 861}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1089, "end": 1109}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1118, "end": 1128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1246, "end": 1251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1286}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1440, "end": 1450}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1495}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
