The STAT reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Prof . Martin Zeidler ( University of Sheffield ) [ 60 ] . In brief , Hsu cells were transfected with STAT reporter plasmid p6x2DRAF - Luc ( multimerised Drosophila STAT - responsive element with a Firefly luciferase reporter ) and a control plasmid , pAct - Renilla ( Renilla luciferase gene under control of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter for constitutive expression ) . Cells were also transfected with dsRNA against Cul4 or GFP . Cells were stimulated with heat inactivated E . coli , WNV ( MOI = 1 ) or PBS ( Control ) for 1h . Luciferase activity was measured at 16 h post - stimulation . Heat - inactivated bacteria were prepared by incubating 1\u03bcl of E . coli DH5\u03b1 in 5 ml LB medium at 37 \u00b0 C for 16 h . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of PBS . Heat inactivation was achieved by incubating the cells for 10 min at 90 \u00b0 C . 1 \u03bcl of the suspension was used per well .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 103}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 318}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 353}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 394}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 470}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 554}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 557, "end": 561}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 673}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
