Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 ( hSCARB2 , a receptor of EV71 and CVA16 ) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections . In this study , hSCARB2 - transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody , N3 . A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD - like skin scurfs in mice pre - infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 ( B4 genotype ) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre - inoculated with 5746 ( C2 genotype ) . This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain , spinal cord and limb muscles . Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro - inflammatory cytokines were all reduced . The protective efficacy of N3 was not observed in animals challenged with CVA16 . This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in CVA16 . These results indicate N3 could be useful in treating severe EV71 infections and the hSCARB2 - transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti - enterovirus agent candidates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 302}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 312}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 567}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 1010}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1059}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1163, "end": 1184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1224, "end": 1227}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1294}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
