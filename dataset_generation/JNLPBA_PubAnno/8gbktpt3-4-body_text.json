FPV is able to infect cats by first binding to the feline transferrin receptor ( fTfR ) expressed on the surface of cells , followed by clathrin - mediated endocytosis to initiate infection [ 3 ] . Canine parvovirus CPV - 2 emerged in the late 1970s and was initially unable to infect cats , as it could not bind to the fTfR [ 3 ] . However , infectivity for feline cells was acquired soon after by the genetic variant CPV - 2a , which emerged in 1979 and replaced CPV - 2 [ 4 ] . The ability to infect cats has also been retained by subsequent antigenic variants of CPV - 2a , termed CPV - 2b and CPV - 2c , which only differ from CPV - 2a at a single amino acid position ( VP2 426 ) . These and other antigenic variants of CPV can cause FPL in both naturally acquired and experimental infections of cats [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 159}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 393, "end": 398}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 748, "end": 752}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
