For comparisons of the large exon of vertebrate PARP4 ( e . g . human and rhesus exon 30 ) , we used K - estimator to distinguish high pairwise dN / dS values due to positive selection from the possibility that these sequences are neutrally evolving , but that stochastic fluctuations in small mutation numbers cause apparently large dN / dS ratio differences . For a pair of sequences with a certain number of observed mutations , K - estimator uses Monte Carlo simulations to obtain \" bootstrap \" estimates of how likely it would be to see high dN / dS values if sequences were neutrally evolving . For example , comparing human and rhesus PARP4 exon 30 ( dN / dS ratio of 1 . 75 ) , there is greater than 95 % confidence that a dN / dS ratio of 1 . 75 represents a significant signature of positive selection . Sliding window analyses were performed on pairs of aligned vertebrate PARP4 and PARP14 sequences with a window size of 150 codons and a step size of 50 codons .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 139}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 155}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 174}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 743, "end": 751}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 996}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1018, "end": 1029}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1051, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
