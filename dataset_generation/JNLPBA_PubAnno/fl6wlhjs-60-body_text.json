For a fixed value of \u03b1 , let 1 - \u03b1 denote the specificity ( the probability of a true - negative ) . Similarly , the sensitivity is defined to be the probability of true positive . The threshold , \u03c4 k , \u03b1 , is chosen by solving P ( D k , t > \u03c4 k , \u03b1 ) = \u03b1 for \u03c4 k , \u03b1 . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 - \u03b1 quantile of the { D k , t } process of non - outbreak - based training data , or if { X k , t } is Gaussian then for large m ,", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
