Mice containing a genetically inactivated TLR7 gene [ 29 , 30 ] failed to mount IFNa responses or to upregulate CD69 expression in response to LDV infection , whereas genetically matched TLR7 wild type mice showed strong IFNa responses and CD69 upregulation ( Figure 4A , B ) . Consistent with the results from pDC depletions , LDV plasma titers were again not significantly different in the absence of TLR7 expression and IFNa production ( Figure 4C ) . These results are similar to data from type I interferon receptor - deficient mice infected with LDV , although that study noted slight ( two fold ) increases in virus titers in the absence of type I interferon signaling [ 31 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 99}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 152}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 230}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 266}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 374}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 444}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 553}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 567, "end": 572}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 735}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 755}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 975, "end": 993}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
