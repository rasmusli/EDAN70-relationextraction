In the DPPH method , the antioxidant activity of clove oil was higher than the volatile aglycone fraction , although both samples have high eugenol content . This lower activity could be attributed and according to the authors to the antagonism among other constituents present in small amounts in this fraction . The reducing capacity of the essential oil was also higher than that of the volatile aglycone fraction . Nevertheless in this assay the reference eugenol had weak ability , whereas in the DPPH method it possessed considerable activity . Such a difference could be explained by the different polarity for FRAP method compared with DPPH method . \" Waterlike \" solvents induce a dramatic decrease in the hydrogen atom - donating capability in comparison with ethyl alcohol used in DPPH method [ 80 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 226}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
