{"cord_uid": "rdgm0q7m", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4937337", "divid": "18", "text": "To explore the potential role of PCBPs in PRRSV PRF , we translated the pDluc / PRRSV mRNA in RRL reactions supplemented with nsp1 [UNK] , His - tagged human PCBP2 , or both proteins ( Figure 3A ) . We found that PCBP2 alone did not affect PRF ( right hand lane ) , but when added together with nsp1 [UNK] , synthesis of the \u2212 1 PRF product was stimulated some 3 - fold ( see Supplementary Table ) . We reasoned that if the ' active ' trans - acting stimulator of PRF in PRRSV is a complex of nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP , the RRL system may already contain an abundant form of PCBP , but one which would , in complex with nsp1 [UNK] , preferentially induce \u2212 2 PRF . In this experiment , supplementation with PCBP2 may have generated nsp1 [UNK] - PCBP2 complexes that could preferentially promote \u2212 1 PRF . We therefore translated the PRRSV frameshift reporter mRNA in the WG in vitro translation system on the basis that this lysate might contain fewer endogenous PCBPs , or PCBPs of sufficient evolutionary divergence to preclude any interactions with nsp1 [UNK] . Consistent with our hypothesis , PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addition of both nsp1 [UNK] and PCBP2 , with neither protein alone having any frameshift - stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B ) . Further , supplementation of WG translations with PCBP2 led preferentially to a \u2212 1 PRF , whereas with human PCPB1 , \u2212 2 PRF was most evident ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the abundant form in RRL is PCBP1 . We also tested mouse PCBP3 , human PCBP4 and mouse hn - RNP K / J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D ) . Of these three proteins , only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting , with both \u2212 2 and \u2212 1 PRF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ) . We confirmed the involvement of PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured cells using siRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF , with PCBP1 noticeably affecting \u2212 2 PRF , and PCBP2 , \u2212 1 PRF , consistent with the results of the WG assays above . No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3 , PCBP4 or hnRNP K / J , although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 39}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 52}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 91}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 137}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 164}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 219}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 244}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 329, "end": 341}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 461}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 513}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 575}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 615, "end": 626}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 658}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 702, "end": 708}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 727, "end": 756}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 794, "end": 798}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 828, "end": 859}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 947, "end": 964}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 975}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1058}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1093, "end": 1097}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1197}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1201, "end": 1207}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1362, "end": 1368}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1392, "end": 1400}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1415, "end": 1427}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1429, "end": 1437}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1520}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1537, "end": 1549}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1551, "end": 1563}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1588}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1660, "end": 1666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1724, "end": 1737}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1812, "end": 1824}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T38", "span": {"begin": 1865, "end": 1872}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
