{"cord_uid": "c0w9bw5u", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4855074", "divid": "21", "text": "MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV are two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have caused hundreds of deaths . On one hand , the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On the other hand , the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing . The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN - antagonizing property . Both the MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3phosphorylating complex of TRAF3 \u00b7 TANK \u00b7 TBK1 / IKK - \u03b5 was affected by their N - terminal transmembrane domains . 30 , 32 Interestingly , in the case of community - acquired human coronavirus HKU1 , which normally causes common cold in infected individuals , its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property , 32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV pathogenesis . Using a side - by - side comparison of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV M proteins , we discovered that the extent by which the MERS - CoV M protein suppressed IFN - \u03b2 promoter activity was lower than that by SARS - CoV M protein . This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS - CoV M protein with other transducers . Whereas the MERS - CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3 , its interaction with TBK1 or IKK - \u03b5 was undetectable ( data not shown ) . This distinguished MERS - CoV M protein from the SARS - CoV M protein , which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3 \u00b7 TANK \u00b7 TBK1 / IKK - \u03b5 complex . 30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS - CoV pathogenesis .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 349}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 465}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 488, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 576}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 631, "end": 666}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 827}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 841}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 919}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1039}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1084, "end": 1105}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1116, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1186}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1283}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1294, "end": 1306}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1320, "end": 1341}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1382, "end": 1388}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 1411, "end": 1416}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1427}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1484, "end": 1505}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1535}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1590, "end": 1628}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1713, "end": 1723}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1728, "end": 1742}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
