DNase I and 3D8 scFv at concentrations ranging from 1 . 5625610 23 units to 0 . 05 units were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator ( iNCYTO ) . Uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 106}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 118}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 128}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 141}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
