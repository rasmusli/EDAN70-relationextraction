While the RNA could be of viral origin it is important to note that many of the host - derived intracellular protein aggregates previously noted also contain host mRNA [ 113 , 114 , 116 , 117 ] . It is reasonable to conclude that if the ICIs observed in KD patients were related to one of these structures , they would positively stain for RNA .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 123}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 293}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
