In brief , HCV is believed to first interact with HS and LDLR on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion . Subsequently , interaction with other host factors such as SR - BI , CD81 , CLDN1 , and OCLN ultimately leads to viral internalization via the socalled clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Fusion between viral and endosomal membranes is followed by release of the viral genome into the cytosol , where translation and replication take place . Finally , HCV particles are assembled and released from the hepatocytes .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 81}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 145}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 274}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 297}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 316}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 497}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
