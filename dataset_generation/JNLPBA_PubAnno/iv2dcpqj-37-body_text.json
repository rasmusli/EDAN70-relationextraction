Subsequently , the plasmids were linearized by EcoRV and transcribed in vitro using a RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system ( catalog no . P1300 ; Promega ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The resulting RNA was labeled with photobiotin ( catalog no . A14216 ; Baoman , Shanghai , China ) using a mercury vapor lamp for 30 min . HEK293T cells grown on 6 - well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids ( pMyc - NS5A and pMyc - eEF1A ) and lyzed with the lysis buffer . The lysate collected from two wells of the 6 - well plate ( lyzed with 150 \u00b5L of lysis buffer per well ) was incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA ( 2 \u00b5g ) for 4 h at 4 [UNK] C , and then incubated with streptavidin beads ( catalog no . 11205D ; Invitrogen ) for another 30 min at room temperature . The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti - Myc MAb ( 1 : 1000 ) . For competitive RNA pulldown , the cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of unlabeled IRES RNA ( 0 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 5 and 3 \u00b5g ) for 1 h at 4 [UNK] C and then incubated with the biotinylated IRES and streptavidin beads . The experiments were carried out in triplicates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 14}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 42}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 100}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 125}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 128, "end": 154}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 184}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 209}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 415}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 591}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 605}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 808}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1068}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1272, "end": 1290}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
