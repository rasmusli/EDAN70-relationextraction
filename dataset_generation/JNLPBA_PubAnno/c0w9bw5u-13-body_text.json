{"cord_uid": "c0w9bw5u", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4855074", "divid": "13", "text": "To further analyze the molecular mechanism and consequences through which MERS - CoV M protein exerts its inhibitory effect , we first investigated what signal transducer molecule might interact with the M protein . Several RLR transducers were ectopically expressed with MERS - CoV M protein in cultured cells for a coimmunoprecipitation experiment . When the transducers were precipitated with an anti - FLAG antibody , the M protein was only detected in TRAF3 - containing precipitate ( Figure 4A ; lane 4 compared with lanes 1 - 3 ) even though M protein was abundantly expressed in all samples with other transducers ( Figure 4A ; lower panel for input ) , TRAF3 functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer MAVS with the downstream signaling complex containing TBK1 and IKK - \u03b5 kinases that are essential for IRF3 activation . 34 , 53 The physical association of the MERS - CoV M protein with TRAF3 ( Figure 4A ) prompted us to test whether the adapter function of TRAF3 would be particularly affected by M protein . We performed another co - immunoprecipitation experiment to explore the possibility that M protein could perturb the interaction of TRAF3 with the downstream transducer complex . When TRAF3 and TBK1 were ectopically expressed in cultured cells , the detection of TBK1 in TRAF3 - immunoprecipitate confirmed the specific recruitment of TBK1 to TRAF3 in the absence of M protein ( Figure 4B ; lane 2 compared with lane 1 ) . However , when M protein was added to the system , the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted ( Figure 4B ; lane 3 compared with lane 2 ) , demonstrating that the physical association of MERS - CoV M protein with TRAF3 perturbs TRAF3 - TBK1 interaction .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 95}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 180}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 214}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 240}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 293}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 399, "end": 420}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 436}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 559}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 610, "end": 622}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 668}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 734, "end": 739}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 748, "end": 777}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 793}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 813}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 836, "end": 841}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 915}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 926}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 992, "end": 998}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 1032, "end": 1042}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 1133, "end": 1143}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1182}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1191, "end": 1221}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1228, "end": 1234}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1243}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1307, "end": 1312}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1315, "end": 1321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1379, "end": 1384}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1387, "end": 1393}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1411, "end": 1421}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1482, "end": 1492}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1542, "end": 1548}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1552, "end": 1557}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1699}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1704, "end": 1710}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T37", "span": {"begin": 1725, "end": 1732}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
