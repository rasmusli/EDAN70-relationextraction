The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines increased in the CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice ( Figure 6A , Figure S5 ) . Immunization with rVV - N25 affected serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in CN2 - 29 ( + / 2 ) / MxCre ( + / 2 ) mice and caused a return to the cytokine levels observed in wild - type untreated mice ( Figure 6A ) . In wild - type mice , the cytokine levels remained unchanged after immunization ( Figure 6A ) . These results indicated that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 136}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 210}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 350, "end": 373}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 551}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 664}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
