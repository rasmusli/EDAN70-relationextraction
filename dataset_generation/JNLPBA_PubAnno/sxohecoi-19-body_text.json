Using IgG from cervicovaginal fluid of three HIV - infected women and from seminal fluid of three infected men , enhanced transcytosis occurred at IgG concentrations well within their expected range in genital tract secretions ( Figure 4A and 4B ) [ 18 ] . The ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG ( Spearman ' s rho = 0 . 94 , p = 0 . 005 ; Figure 4C ) and less so with binding to monomeric Env glycoprotein from the same virus strain ( HIV - 1 US657 ) ( rho = 0 . 65 , p = 0 . 16 ; Figure S6 ) . None of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIV US657 , the clinical R5 strain used in these experiments , at IgG concentrations as high as 50 mg / ml ( not shown ) . Consistent with HIVIG and the non - neutralizing mAbs , higher concentrations of genital tract IgGs generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 31}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 138}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 279}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 418}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 512}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 623}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 743}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 837}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 944}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 990}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
