An interesting and complex correlation was observed . In detail , the ( C + G ) 3 have highly significant correlations with A , U , C , G and C + G , respectively , indicating C + G may reflect interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection . However , the A have no correlation with A 3 , G 3 and C 3 , and U have no correlation with A 3 ( Table 4 ) . Both cases suggested that the nucleotide constraint possibly influence synonymous codon usage of polioviruses . In addition , the correlation between the Axis 1 ( calculated by PCA ) and the values of A , C , G , U , A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , ( G + C ) , ( G + C ) 3 of each strain was also analyzed . The significant correlation was found between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to some extent excluding Axis 1 and the value of A ( Table 4 ) . The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among ORFs of polioviruses strains was directly related to the base composition . Finally , the ENC - plot [ ENC plotted against ( G + C ) 3 % ] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve ( Figure 1 ) . These imply that the codon bias can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition , in other words , by mutation pressure rather than natural selection .
