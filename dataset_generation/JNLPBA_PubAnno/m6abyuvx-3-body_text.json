HCV causes persistent infections that can lead to chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis , and hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) [ 2 ] . Antiviral drugs are not highly effective in individuals with a chronic infection ; furthermore , an effective vaccine against HVC has not been developed . A convenient animal model of HCV infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective HCV vaccine .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
