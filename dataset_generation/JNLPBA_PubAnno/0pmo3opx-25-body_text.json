The structure of the unliganded pAPN was used to determine the structures of amino acid - soaked pAPN . Objective Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of amino acids and showed strong electron density for each of the amino acids ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . Based on these maps , the models of amino acids were built , and the models of pAPN / amino acid complexes were further refined . Crystallographic statistics can be found in Supplemental Figure 5 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 114}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 153}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 218}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 492}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
