{"cord_uid": "c3psvuzp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4038475", "divid": "30", "text": "Sequencing of primate PARP genes PARP4 exon 30 sequences were amplified from DNA isolated from cell lines obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories ( Camden , NJ ) , the FrozenZoo ( San Diego , CA ) , ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) and the Tulane National Primate Research Center ( Covington , LA ) ( Table S1 ) . Sequences were amplified by PCR using Phusion ( New England Biolabs ) polymerase using primers that anneal to the introns around exon 30 ( primer sequences in Table S2 ) . PARP9 , 14 and 15 sequences were amplified from RNA isolated from cell lines ( Table S1 ) . Sequences were amplified by one step reversetranscription PCR using SuperScript III One - Step RT - PCR with Platinum Taq ( Invitrogen ) to produce complementary DNA ( cDNA ) using the primers listed in Table S2 . Repeated attempts to amplify PARP15 from Siamang gibbon failed , supporting the conclusion that gibbons have lost PARP15 . cDNAs were directly sequenced using internal primers by Sanger sequencing . Sequences from gorilla and squirrel monkey ( Saimiri boliviensis ) were obtained from publically available genome assemblies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 57}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 385}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 433, "end": 441}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 476, "end": 504}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 690}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 734}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 741}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 818}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 903}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 905, "end": 911}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
