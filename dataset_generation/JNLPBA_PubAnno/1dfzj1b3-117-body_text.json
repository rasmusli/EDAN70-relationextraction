The human monocyte cell line THP - 1 is often used as a model for tissue macrophages . Zhou et al . ( 2007 ) [ 149 ] showed that 1 , 8 - cineole inhibited the Egr - 1 synthesis and nuclear localization induced by LPS in THP - 1 cells but did not affect the LPS - induced NF - \u03baB expression in nuclei . Therefore , the authors concluded that 1 , 8 - cineole may preferentially block the effect of Egr - 1 by inhibiting the synthesis of Egr - 1 and preventing Egr - 1 nuclear internalization instead of NF - \u03baB inhibition [ 149 ] . Some authors reported that \u03b1 - pinene clearly inhibited the translocation of NF - \u03baB / p65 protein into nuclei in LPS - stimulated THP - 1 cells , through the increase of expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 protein [ 150 , 151 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 33}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 43}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 71}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 169}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 195}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 217}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 388}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 492, "end": 500}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 625}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 656, "end": 664}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 679, "end": 687}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 730}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 828, "end": 850}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 949}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
