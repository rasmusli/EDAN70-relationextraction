The autoimmune aspects of KD have recently been reviewed [ 118 ] . Self - antigen responses to a variety of targets have actually been well described in KD . These include recent reports of antibody responses to type III collagen , myosin [ 119 ] , cardiolipin [ 120 ] , alpha - enolase [ 121 ] , and anti - endothelial antibodies . Anti - endothelial antibodies are particularly interesting as these are seen in other disorders , such as SLE and renal allograft rejection [ 122 ] . Other vasculitides have also been associated with anti - endothelial antibodies . These have been shown to cause upregulation of E - selectin , VCAM - 1 , ICAM - 1 and NF\u03baB [ 123 ] . Responses to these antibodies include upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 46}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 81}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 303, "end": 321}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 330}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 352}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 378}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 422}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 454}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 624, "end": 654}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 703, "end": 716}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 727}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 729, "end": 738}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 742, "end": 747}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 834}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
