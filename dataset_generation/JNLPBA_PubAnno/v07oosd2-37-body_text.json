However , progress in this area is very limited or even non - existent . Pigs that are resistant to ETEC : F4 and / or F18 do not express intestinal receptors for these fimbrial types [ 2 ] . The expression of these receptors is genetically determined and inherited in a dominant way and the loci controlling F4R and F18R expression are located on separate chromosomes . The gene underlying resistance to F4ab / ac ETEC has been assigned to porcine chromosome 13 , whereas the F4ad ETEC receptor is located on another chromosome that was not identified [ 102 ] . A PCR - RFLP test has been developed to allow genotyping for F4ab / ac ETEC resistance / susceptibility [ 103 ] . Three different genotypes were observed and were identified as resistant ( RR ) , susceptible heterozygote ( SR ) and susceptible homozygote ( SS ) . However , it cannot be predicted if additional types of adhesive fimbriae or new variants of known types will emerge which could bind to yet unidentified receptors and could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and mortality in the nursery [ 2 ] . It is difficult to understand the reasons behind the non - exploration of the genetic breeding for ETEC resistant pigs to reduce economic losses associated with PWD and to reduce the use of antimicrobials on farms . It was shown in an early study that F4 susceptible piglets tend to have better growth performance then F4 resistant ones [ 104 ] . Also , heterozygous F4R \u2212 piglets are not passively protected from infection by ETEC : F4 strains [ 105 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 284, "end": 305}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 459}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 468}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 587, "end": 609}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 642}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1029, "end": 1047}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
