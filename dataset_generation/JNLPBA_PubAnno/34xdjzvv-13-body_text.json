Elevated IFN - a ( muscle ) , IFN - b ( brainstem , spinal cord , and muscle ) , and IFN - c ( brainstem and muscle ) responding to the innate immunity against virus infection were downregulated in transgenic mice that received N3 after infection in contrast to non - treated or isotype antibody - treated mice ( Fig . 8 ) . Expression of TNF - a in three tissues and IL - 1b in the brainstem and muscle of transgenic mice were also suppressed significantly ( Fig . 9 ) . These results indicate that N3 protects mice from developing pathogenesis caused by EV71 infection .
