No other function of ORF2 protein has yet been reported . In this article , we present evidence which suggest that the ORF2 protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle . The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments . First , ORF2 was capable of directly interacting with the F - box protein \u03b2TRCP , both in vitro and in vivo . Second , \u039435 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , was also capable of inhibiting NF - \u03baB activity , thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact . Third , ORF3 protein of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 17}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 86}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 252}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 471}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 532, "end": 538}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 700}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 796}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
