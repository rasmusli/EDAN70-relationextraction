These oils , along with Persea gamblei , were already reported as being potent inhibitors of linoleic oxidation measured through the \u03b2 - carotene bleaching test [ 44 ] . Such activities were independent of the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
