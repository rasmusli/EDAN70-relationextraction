Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone . Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses , but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility , mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined . Here , we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide . Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread , we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows , whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance . Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity . By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009 , we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated . In conclusion , the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes . The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 343, "end": 369}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 615}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1807, "end": 1821}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
