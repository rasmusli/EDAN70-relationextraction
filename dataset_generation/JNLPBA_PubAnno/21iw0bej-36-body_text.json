Our results confirmed that the non - structural protein 3D increases the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 phase by decreasing the expression of the G0 / G1 and S phase related - cell cycle proteins cyclinD , CDK4 and cyclinE1 , while 3C decreases the percentage of cells in G2 / M phase by decreasing the expression of G2 / M - related proteins CDK1 and cyclinB1 . These findings raise the possibility that the non - structural proteins 3D and 3C may function coordinately in the context of an EV - D68 infection to enhance the percentage of cells in G0 / G1 and increase the G0 / G1 to G2 / M ratio . It is noted that non - structural 3D protein of EV - A71 mediates cell cycle arrest at S phase , while 3D of EV - D68 mediated cell cycle at G0 / G1 , although until now the detailed reason of the difference is not clear , it is speculated that 290 of same amino acid sequence might bind with a same target which is responsible for the function of cell cycle arrest , while 172 of different amino acid sequence might bind other different factors which is responsible for different ability of cell cycle regulation , and this part will be investigated in the future .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 32}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 206}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 267}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 362}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 412}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 419}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 432}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 443}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 556}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 569}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 646}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 653}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 825, "end": 853}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 914}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1057}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
