We have previously shown pneumolysin to reduce ependymal ciliary beat frequency [ 4 ] . Pneumolysin was purified as previously described [ 19 ] . Cells were exposed to 1 ml M199 containing 300 ng of pneumolysin , which was preheated to 37 \u00b0 C . The CBF was measured at intervals of 0 , 5 , and 15 minutes over the course of the experiment . At each time point , images were captured from four different areas along the ciliated edge of the brain slice .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
