[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] However , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , novel mechanisms of ZIKV transmission have been described including sexual and transplacental transmission . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia and has spread unabated through South America , Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2 years . 8 , 9 Factors including increased global travel and an expansion of the range of Aedes mosquitos owing to climate change portend further spread of this virus , expanding its range in the southern United States over the next few years . 5 , 9 ZIKV infection presents with a prodrome of myalgias , arthralgias , malaise and low - grade fever with a rash appearing approximately 7 days post infection that may occur with conjunctivitis and retro - orbital pain . The clinical presentation is similar to , albeit less severe than , chikungunya and dengue viral infections , which are also transmitted through the same mosquito vectors . During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013 , an increased risk of Guillain Barre ' syndrome was identified in infected individuals . 4 , 6 , 10 Alarmingly , during the recent outbreak in South and Central America , microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in infants have been observed in mothers who were infected by ZIKV during pregnancy . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In April 2016 , the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly establishing ZIKV as a teratogen . There are currently no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection . Therefore , the development and evaluation of potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent is of high priority . 14 Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic ZIKV prME DNA vaccine delivered by electroporation for its immunogenicity and its impact on ZIKV infection in a pathogenic animal challenge model . 1", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1984, "end": 1998}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
