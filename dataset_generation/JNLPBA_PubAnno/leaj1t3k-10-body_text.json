This novel approach is based on the discovery 30 years ago that nucleic acid molecules could be used to specifically target complementary viral nucleic acid sequences and inhibit viral replication [ 52 , 53 ] . With these new promising molecules comes the ability to simultaneously target multiple viral sequences , which would preclude the selection of drug resistance . Mechanisms of antiviral activity exerted by CPP conjugates . These antiviral agents can target retroviruses , as shown for HIV , non - retroviral RNA viruses , as shown for the negative - sense RNA EBOV and HCV , and DNA viruses , as shown for HSV . Interference with viral RNA processing and translation further inhibits viral replication . CPP conjugates can also be designed to target virus - infected cells . CPP can also inactivate the virion and render cells resistant to infection , inhibiting cell infection . proCasp3 stands for pro - caspase 3 ; RT stands for reverse transcription ; Tn stands for transportan .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 157}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 168}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 191}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 360}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 839}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1083, "end": 1092}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1103, "end": 1119}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1121, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1162}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1185}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
