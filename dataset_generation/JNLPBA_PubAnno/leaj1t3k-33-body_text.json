Recently , the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi - directional protein transduction system where the antiviral protein of interest , p27SJ , was expressed with tat at its C - terminal . Secreted into the cell medium , the fusion protein efficiently entered HIV - infected cells through a tat - mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV - 1 transcription and replication ( Figure 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 64}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 72}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 251}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 327, "end": 345}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 365}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 390}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 463}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 518}, "obj": "Gene"}]}
