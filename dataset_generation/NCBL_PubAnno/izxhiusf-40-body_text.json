Although previously other authors have had similar results , isolated strains of H . influenzae were never further characterised [ 9 , 10 , 20 , 23 ] . To our knowledge this is the first report that associates bronchial infection with nontypeable H . influenzae ( NTHi ) in young persistant wheezers . Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that persistent wheezers present an underlying inflammation induced by chronic bacterial infection . Chronic NTHI infection , resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses , has previously been reported by others [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . Moreover , in the lower airways of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease , NTHI has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [ 31 , 34 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 333}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 403}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 493, "end": 513}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 587}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 589, "end": 612}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 892}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 894, "end": 899}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
