The main components of the oils included \u03b1 - pinene , 1 , 8 - cineole , \u03b2 - eudesmol , spathulenol , hedycaryol , \u03b4 - cadinene , among other components , nevertheless predominating the oxygenated sesquiterpenids ( 47 . 4 % ) . The essential oils were able to inhibit the bleaching of \u03b2 - carotene . The precentage of inhibition was even close ( 66 . 4 % ) to those found for the non - polar - sub - fraction ( chloroformic ) ( 69 . 1 % ) , which presented the best activity . However , the authors did not explain these results which are contradictory to those obtained when the antioxidant activity was measured through other method , in which the polar fraction rich in phenolic compouds had the greatest activity [ 47 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
