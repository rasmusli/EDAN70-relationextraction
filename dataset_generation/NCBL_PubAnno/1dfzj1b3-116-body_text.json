( 2000 ) [ 148 ] described that anethole , eugenol and isoeugenol inhibited TNF - \u03b1 - induced NF - \u03baB activation in ML1 - a cells . The same authors also reported that anethole inhibited the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 , blocking its phosphorylation in TNF - stimulated ML1 - a cells . In the same cells and with TNF stimulation , anethole did not induce the phosphorylation of MAP kinase . Besides NF - \u03baB and MAP kinase , anethole also blocked TNF - induced JNK and AP - 1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
