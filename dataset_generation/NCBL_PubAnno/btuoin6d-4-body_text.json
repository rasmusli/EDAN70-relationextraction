Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization of military trainees in the medical field . A study by the US military showed that 10 % of recruits at boot camp were infected with Adv , and 90 % of patients with pneumonia were infected with adenovirus [ 10 , 11 ] . In 2006 , a study by the South Korean military reported that the prevalence of Adv was 61 % among military recruits with acute respiratory symptoms [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Adv may also progress to pneumonia . Recently , several case series were reported describing recruits that died in boot camp due to severe adenoviral pneumonia in South Korea since 2012 [ 13 , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] . Even if mortality results or clinical outcome of Adv infection could be affected by selection bias , it has been reported that Adv infection may be severe with a higher incidence of progression to respiratory and multiorgan failure compared to other viral etiologies with the exception of influenza . Thus , some clinical data have been reported regarding predictive factors of respiratory failure associated with Adv infection [ 18 , 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 34}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 169}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 383}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 413}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 506, "end": 510}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 575}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 612, "end": 647}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 682, "end": 692}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 817}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 926}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1070, "end": 1105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1172}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1251, "end": 1271}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1287, "end": 1301}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
