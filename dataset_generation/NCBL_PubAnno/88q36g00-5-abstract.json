We investigated postnatal growth , which could be related to neurologic outcome . From postnatal day ( P ) 6 to P10 , offspring growth was significantly retarded in the LPS group than in the Control group ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Although significant differences were not observed between the LPS and LPS + HW group , maternal administration of Hydrogen water ( HW ) restored offspring growth to the control level ( Fig . 1 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 229}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
