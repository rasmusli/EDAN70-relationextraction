{"cord_uid": "sb3ccvsk", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5030268", "divid": "2", "text": "Viral infections have long been implicated as triggers of autoimmune diseases , including multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , a central nervous system ( CNS ) inflammatory demyelinating disorder . Epitope spreading , molecular mimicry , cryptic antigen , and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self - reactive ( SR ) immune cells , ultimately leading to organ - specific autoimmune disease . Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus ( JHMV ) - induced demyelination , this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells . In this model , immune - mediated demyelination is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control . However , their decline during persisting infection , despite ongoing demyelination , suggests an active control mechanism . Antigen - specific IL - 10 - secreting CD4 + T cells ( Tr1 ) and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , both known to control autoimmunity and induced following JHMV infection , were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells . Ablation of Foxp3 + Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4 + T cells within cervical lymph nodes ( CLN ) , albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls . In contrast , infected IL - 27 receptor deficient ( IL - 27R \u2212 / \u2212 ) mice , characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells , revealed that SR CD4 + T cells in CLN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS . These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T - cell - mediated autoimmune pathology . The JHMV model is thus valuable to decipher tissue - specific mechanisms preventing autoimmunity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 78}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 109}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 114}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 187}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 430}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 494}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 533}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 715}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 864}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1044}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 1066, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 1778, "end": 1799}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1885, "end": 1898}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
