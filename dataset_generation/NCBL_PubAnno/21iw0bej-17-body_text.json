The cells were cultured in medium or were synchronized in S phase by culture with 0 . 85 mM thymidine for 24 h . Then , the cells were mock infected or were infected with 0 . 8 MOI of EV - D68 for 2 h , and fresh culture medium or 0 . 85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1E ) . Thymidine induced obvious S phase arrest ( P < 0 . 001 ; Figure 1F ) . The genomic RNA level remained similar in S phase - synchronized cells and control non - synchronized cells at 2 h post - infection ( Figure 1M ) and at 24 h post - infection ( P > 0 . 05 ; Figure 1G ) . Furthermore , the TCID50 / mL values at 24 h post - infection were equivalent for the S phase - synchronized cell supernatant ( 2 . 59 \u00b1 1 . 37 \u00d7 10 5 ) and the control cell supernatant ( 3 . 28 \u00b1 1 . 80 \u00d7 10 5 ) ( P > 0 . 05 ; Figure 1H ) . These results suggest that S - phase arrest does not affect EV - D68 viral entry , replication or production .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
