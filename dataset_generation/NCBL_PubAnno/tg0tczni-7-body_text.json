It has saved the lives and health of innumerable people , in particular children . However , poliovirus is highly genetically variable . OPV viruses may undergo transformation into circulating highly diverged VDPV , exhibiting properties hardly distinguishable from those of wild polioviruses [ 19 ] . So far , little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date . To our knowledge , this is the first report of the codon usage analysis on polioviruses ( including wild strains , attenuated live vaccine strains and VDPV strains ) . In this study , we analyzed the codon usage data and base composition of 48 available representative complete ORFs of poliovirus to obtain some clues to the features of genetic evolution of the virus .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 42}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 592, "end": 605}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 668, "end": 673}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
