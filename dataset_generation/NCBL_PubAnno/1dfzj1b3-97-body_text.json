Inflammatory mediators such as IL - 1 , TNF - \u03b1 or LPS stimulate iNOS expression in rodent macrophages in vitro . NO production and / or iNOS expression are also induced by inflammatory mediators in a wide variety of mammalian cells , producing large amounts of NO for prolonged time periods [ 25 ] . iNOS catalises the production of large amount of NO from L - arginine and molecular oxygen , is mainly triggered and regulated by a series of signalling pathways including nuclear factor - \u03baB ( NF - \u03baB ) transcription factor and mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) [ 116 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
