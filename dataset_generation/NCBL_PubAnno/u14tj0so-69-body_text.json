Then in Section ' Comparison with ShapeKnots ' we compare accuracy of Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots , a method that incorporates SHAPE reactivity data to predict RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure . In Section ' Iterative HFold with SimFold ' s suboptimal structures ' we compare performance accuracy of Iterative HFold with two inputs : HotKnots hotspots and suboptimal structures . Section ' Energy model ' provides more insight into the energy model used in this work .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
