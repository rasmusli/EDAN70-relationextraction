{"cord_uid": "nomco7bv", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5819164", "divid": "5", "text": "Frequent and severe respiratory tract infections ( RTIs ) constitute an important morbidity factor in our society and a considerable cost burden in terms of medical treatment and time of work - loss [ 1 , 2 ] . RTIs are divided into upper RTIs ( URTIs ) including common cold , pharyngitis , otitis , sinusitis , laryngotracheitis , epiglottitis and lower RTIs ( LRTIs ) including bronchitis , pneumonia and bronchiolitis [ 3 ] . Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [ 4 , 5 ] and vitamin D status [ 6 , 7 ] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk . In addition , the role of overweight ( body mass index ( BMI ) = 25 . 0 - 29 . 9 kg / m 2 ) and in particular obesity ( BMI \u2265 30 kg / m 2 ) in predisposition to RTIs is increasingly discussed [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide [ 14 ] and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity [ 15 ] . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes . Thus , obesity was associated with non - allergic rhinitis [ 8 ] and influenza like - illness [ 9 ] . Moreover , two population - based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [ 10 , 11 ] . Two recent Danish population - based studies reported an excess of a large spectrum of RTIs including pneumonia among obese people [ 12 , 13 ] . The overall aim of our study targeting the adult population in South Baden , Germany , is to identify risk factors for the susceptibility to RTIs . Here we present data on the role of obesity as contributing factor to a high RTI burden in the German society and explore effect modification by gender , sports activity and nutritional patterns .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 49}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 56}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 216}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 252}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 276}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 278, "end": 290}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 299}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 311}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 331}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 346}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 361}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 363, "end": 369}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 381, "end": 392}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 404}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 422}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 599, "end": 603}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 647}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 728}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 771, "end": 776}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 900, "end": 911}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 921}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 988, "end": 1002}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 1033, "end": 1041}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 1115, "end": 1123}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T25", "span": {"begin": 1137, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T26", "span": {"begin": 1170, "end": 1178}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T27", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1222}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T28", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1257}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T29", "span": {"begin": 1365, "end": 1394}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T30", "span": {"begin": 1396, "end": 1400}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T31", "span": {"begin": 1564, "end": 1569}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T32", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1589}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T33", "span": {"begin": 1595, "end": 1601}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T34", "span": {"begin": 1763, "end": 1768}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T35", "span": {"begin": 1806, "end": 1814}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T36", "span": {"begin": 1847, "end": 1851}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
