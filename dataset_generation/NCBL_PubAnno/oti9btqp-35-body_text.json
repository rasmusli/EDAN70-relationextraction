The brain tissue was then weighed and homogenised in 600 \u03bcl RLT buffer in a 2 ml cryovial using a TissueLyser ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) with a stainless steel bead for 6 min at 30 cycles / s . Viral RNA was also isolated from blood with the RNeasy Plus mini kit ( Qiagen ) . A ZIKV specific real - time RT - PCR assay was utilised for the detection of viral RNA from subject animals . RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the primers ZIKV 835 and ZIKV 911c and probe ZIKV 860FAM with the TaqMan Fast Virus 1 - Step Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . A standard curve was generated in parallel for each plate and used for the quantification of viral genome copy numbers . The StepOnePlus Real - Time PCR System ( Life Technologies Corporation , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) software version 2 . 3 was used to calculate the cycle threshold ( Ct ) values , and a Ct value [UNK] 38 for at least one of the replicates was considered positive , as previously described . 29 Pre - bleeds were negative in this assay .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
