In Italy , it has been estimated that up to 9 . 5 % of children aged 6 - 7 years and 10 . 4 % of teenagers aged 13 - 14 years have ever been affected by this condition [ 1 ] . Acute asthma exacerbations are one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency Department ( ED ) and for hospitalization in the pediatric age . In the United States , among asthmatic children nearly 60 % have one or more acute exacerbations each year [ 2 , 3 ] , and up to 20 % require ED visits annually [ 4 ] . Moreover , asthmatic patients treated in the ED are at higher risk for future exacerbations and any single severe acute episode may progress to life - threatening respiratory failure [ 2 , 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 42}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 246}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 433}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 574, "end": 584}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 746}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
