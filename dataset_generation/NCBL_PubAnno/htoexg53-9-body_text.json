JX869059 ) . A cDNA fragment was generated by DNA synthesis ( Invitrogen Life Technology , Regensburg , Germany ) and cloned into the MVA transfer plasmid pIIIH5red [ 45 ] to place the MERS - CoV N gene sequence under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early / late promoter PmH5 [ 46 ] resulting in the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red - MERS - N .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
