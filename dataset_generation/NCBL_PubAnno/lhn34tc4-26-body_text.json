Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the U . S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed residents of Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore , and the U . S . and found significant regional variability [ 22 ] . The proportion of survey respondents favouring the quarantine of persons suspected of having been exposed to a serious contagious disease was as follows : 76 % in the U . S . , 81 % in Hong Kong , 89 % in Singapore , and 95 % in Taiwan . By way of comparison , in the present study , 94 % of respondents agreed that quarantine is a good way to stop the spread of infectious disease outbreaks . Interestingly , in our study , significantly fewer ( 58 % ) agreed that public health officials should be able to detain those who fail to obey quarantine orders . Likewise , in the Harvard study , the proportions favouring the use of quarantine decrease significantly if people could be arrested for refusing ( to a low of only 42 % in the U . S . to a high of 70 % in Taiwan ) . The authors partially attributed the observed differences to prior experience with infectious disease outbreaks in which quarantine and other restrictive measures were implemented [ 21 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 527}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 752, "end": 771}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1266}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
