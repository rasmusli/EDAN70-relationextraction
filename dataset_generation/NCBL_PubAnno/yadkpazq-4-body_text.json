Innate pathogen recognition relies on a set of sensory molecules , the Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , which enable the immediate reaction of specific immune cells to pathogen \" danger signals \" , the so - called pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) [ 4 ] . Due to their abundance in all bacterial as well as some viral genomes , oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) containing unmethylated cytosine - phosphate - guanosine ( CpG ) motifs are effectively recognized as PAMPs by the vertebrate innate immune system [ 5 ] . Response to CpG ODN stimulation is conferred through TLR9 , expressed mainly in the intracellular compartments of human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) [ 6 , 7 ] . Alarmed TLR9 is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms : upregulation of costimulatory molecules major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) II , B7 . 1 and B7 . 2 on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [ 8 , 9 ] and production of cytokines such as type I interferon ( IFN ) , interleukin ( IL ) - 12 , IFN\u03b3 , IL - 6 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) \u03b1 , contribute to providing an optimal immune environment for the development of innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens [ 10 , 11 ] . Probably the most important antiviral property of CpG ODN resides in their potential to stimulate the production of high amounts of type I IFN by pDCs [ 12 ] . This family of cytokines , which includes IFN\u03b1 , IFN\u03c9 and IFN\u03b2 , has been shown to considerably enhance natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxicity [ 13 ] , promote differentiation , maturation and immunostimulatory functions of monocytes and DCs [ 14 ] , induce B cell production of immunoglobulin [ 15 ] and T - helper ( Th ) 1 differentiation of T cells [ 16 , 17 ] . Moreover , upon binding to their ubiquitously distributed receptor , type I IFNs effectively induce the synthesis of various intracellular proteins which interfere with the replication of a broad range of viruses [ 18 ] . The myxovirusresistance protein ( Mx ) GTPase is a well - studied example of these intracellular antiviral effectors . This enzyme is known to be directly regulated by the type I IFN , and its detection is readily used as marker for upregulation and biological activity of this cytokine family [ 19 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 1217, "end": 1223}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
