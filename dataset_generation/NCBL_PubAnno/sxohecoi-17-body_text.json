For example , for every infectious unit , about 30 times more virus is transcytosed with VRC01 than with HIVIG ( Figure 3E ) . Note that independently of transcytosis , HIV - 1 JRLF infectivity on TZM - bl cells increased about 3 . 5 - fold after incubation of virus for 12 hours at pH 6 . 0 compared with pH 7 . 4 ; however , IC 50s were very similar ( , 15 % difference ) at the two pH values ( pH comparisons done for 2F5 and VRC01 only ; data not shown ) . Virus infectivity was essentially abrogated after a 12 - hour incubation at pH 4 . 0 ( data not shown ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
