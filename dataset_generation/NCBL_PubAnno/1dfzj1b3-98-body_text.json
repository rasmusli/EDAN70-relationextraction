In this gene , four transcription factors including NF - \u03baB , CCAAT / enhancer - binding protein ( C / EBP ) , activator protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) and CRE - binding protein ( CREB ) have been identified as regulators of COX - 2 transcription [ 22 , 126 ] . NF - \u03baB and MAPKs are of current interest as potential targets in therapies form diverse inflammatory symptoms .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 534}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
