In addition , we also compared the fever and response to antipyretic treatment between the patients in the no pathogen group and in the Adv and Non - Adv groups , the results of which are shown in Table 3 . In general , Adv group patients had a much longer duration of fever after admission than the Non - Adv patients ( 3 . 2 \u00b1 1 . 6 days vs . 1 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 2 days , 2 . 2 \u00b1 1 . 5 days , P = 0 . 018 ) and symptom onset ( 5 . 8 \u00b1 2 . 2 days vs . 3 . 9 \u00b1 2 . 5 days , 3 . 7 \u00b1 2 . 0 days , P = 0 . 006 ) . To evaluate the degree of fever , we assessed the mean temperature and number of patients to the maximal temperature at admission . The Adv group patients had higher a mean temperature at admission ( 37 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 3 \u00b0 C vs . 37 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 3 \u00b0 C vs . 37 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2 \u00b0 C , P = 0 . 005 ) , and more observed instances of a temperature of over 40 and 39 to 40 \u00b0 C ( P < 0 . 001 ) . The Adv group patients took longer to attain the maximal fall in body temperature than the Non - Adv and unknown pathogen group patients at admission ( 10 . 2 \u00b1 5 . 6 vs . 8 . 0 \u00b1 4 . 5 vs . 8 . 6 \u00b1 5 . 5 , P = 0 . 015 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 471}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 731}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
