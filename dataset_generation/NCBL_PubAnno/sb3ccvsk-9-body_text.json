To determine the percentage of demyelination , LFB - stained sections of all six levels per individual mouse were scanned with an Aperio ScanScope ( Vista , CA , USA ) at 40 \u00d7 and areas of demyelination within the white matter tracks were quantify using Aperio software .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 282}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 329}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 473, "end": 487}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
