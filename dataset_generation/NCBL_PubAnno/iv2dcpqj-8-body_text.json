To confirm the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A , glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) pulldown assay was performed with the GST - tagged NS5A protein expressed in Escherichia coli and the Myc - tagged eEF1A protein expressed in HEK293T cells . The results showed that GST - NS5A but not GST interacts with eEF1A ( Figure 1B ) . To further verify the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A , coimmunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing [UNK] - tagged NS5A and Myc - tagged eEF1A . After incubation with anti - Flag monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) and Protein G - Agarose , the Myc - tagged eEF1A was found to coprecipitate with the [UNK] - tagged NS5A ( Figure 1C ) . Furthermore , the [UNK] - tagged NS5A was shown to coprecipitate with Myc - eEF1A when the cell lysate was incubated with anti - Myc MAb and Protein G - Agarose ( Figure 1D ) . Considering that both eEF1A and NS5A show a strong affinity for nucleic acids , we investigated whether the NS5A - eEF1A interaction might be mediated through a nonspecific RNA bridge . The results showed that the NS5A - eEF1A interaction was not influenced by RNase treatment , indicating that the interaction is not due to nonspecific RNA - mediated binding ( Figure 1E ) . To examine the colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A , the subcellular localization of [UNK] - NS5A and Myc - eEF1A was examined by confocal microscopy . Both [UNK] - NS5A and Myc - eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1F ) . Taken together , the results demonstrated that eEF1A is an interacting partner of the CSFV NS5A protein .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
