Our results demonstrate that in addition to its effects on the EV - D68 Fermon strain , G2 / M synchronization by nocodazole inhibited the replication and virulence of US / KY / 14 - 18953 and US / MO / 14 - 18947 . Additionally , PAB , which is another agent that can induce G2 / M arrest , also significantly inhibited the production of EV - D68 and EV - A71 . Because nocodazole also has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the production of EV - A71 ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) , medicines that induce G2 / M arrest might be considered as a common approach for inhibiting different types of antienterovirus infection , which provides a new direction for antienterovirus drug development .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 882, "end": 908}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 961}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
