One of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of viral peptide epitopes over the infected cell surface , Further , we checked NF - \u03baB recruitment to the MHC I heavy chain promoter in LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay . Immunoprecipitation was conducted using an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF - \u03baB complex . EGFP expression did not alter p65 recruitment to MHC - I heavy chain promoter . However , full - length or \u039435 - ORF2 expression decreased p65 recruitment to the MHC - I heavy chain promoter . 10 % of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample ( Figure 5B , upper panel ) . We also checked p65 recruitment to interleukin 8 ( IL - 8 ) proximal promoter region , which showed a similar pattern as observed for the MHC - I heavy chain promoter ( Figure 5B , lower panel ) . As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF - \u03baB , aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti - SP1 antibody ( specific for SP1 transcription factor , which also binds to MHC - I heavy chain promoter ) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC - I heavy chain promoter specific primer . As expected , SP1 recruitment to the MHC - I heavy chain promoter was not altered in ORF2 expressing cells ( Figure 5C ) . These experiments confirmed that ORF2 expression specifically prevents p65 NF - \u03baB association with its cognate response element present on natural promoters .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
