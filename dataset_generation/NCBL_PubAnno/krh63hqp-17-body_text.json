The strains sequenced at the end of the pandemic had approximately 80 more mutations than the 2009 reference genotype . The line of best fit reveals a slope of 42 . 1 mutations accumulated per year ( 3 . 2 \u00d7 10 - 3 mutations per site per year ) . Given that the data were collected from viral strains circulating worldwide , the correlation between mutation count and the date of collection was surprisingly good ( r 2 = 0 . 77 ) .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
