{"cord_uid": "me1ajoyb", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC3970152", "divid": "3", "text": "Hantaviruses ( family Bunyaviridae , genus Hantavirus ) are negative - stranded , trisegmented viruses that cause about 200 , 000 disease cases annually , with case fatality rates of 0 . 5 % - 40 % , depending on the virus [ 1 ] . The viral gene segments encode four or five polypeptides . The large ( L ) segment encodes the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) , the medium ( M ) segment encodes a precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into Gn and Gc glycoproteins , and the small ( S ) segment encodes the nucleocapsid ( N ) protein . Some hantaviruses encode a second nonstructural polypeptide ( NSs ) downstream from the N start site in frame 2 [ 2 , 3 ] . Little is known about the immunomodulatory abilities of these proteins ; however , there is evidence the N , Gn and NSs may alter host cellular responses during infection .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 13}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 567}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
