We analyzed 57 patients ; 28 patients were treated with IgM - enriched IVIG , and 29 patients did not receive IVIG therapy . Of all patients suffering from septic shock , 75 % of the IVIG - treated patients and 55 % of the control patients had severe ARDS of various origins . However , although the IVIG group had a lower PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio and required longer ventilation support , longer vasopressor therapy , and longer anti - infective therapy and included MRGN - infected patients , outcome parameters such as LOS in the ICU , LOS in the hospital , and mortality were not significantly different between the groups .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 345}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 432}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 639, "end": 655}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
