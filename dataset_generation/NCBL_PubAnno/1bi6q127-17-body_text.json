The study used sero - surveillance of an African henipavirus in straw - colored fruit bats ( Eidolon helvum ) . While repeated introduction of virus and birthing of pups might drive viral dynamics in a large panmictic population of bats , prolonged infectious periods or latent infection of bats are required to explain henipavirus persistence in small populations ( natural or colony of captive ) . They found that if repeated introduction of virus into small populations was the only mechanism , then acute infections would have to be ~ 40 days in duration . This estimate is considerably longer than the current estimates of the detectable infectious period for henipaviruses in fruit bats , which is approximately 7 days [ 46 ] . Therefore , prolonged or latent infection has to occur in some bats for describing persistence of henipavirus in small populations .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 346, "end": 358}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 629}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 976}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1141}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
