Using LC16m8 , a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus ( VV ) , we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses ( rVVs ) that each encoded one of three different HCV proteins and found that one recombinant virus ( rVV - N25 ) , which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins , resolved pathological chronic hepatitis C symptoms in the liver . We also found that immunization with rVV - N25 suppressed HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice ; moreover , this suppression was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells , as has been previously reported [ 8 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 76}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 451}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
