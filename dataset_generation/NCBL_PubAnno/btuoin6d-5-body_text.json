However , sufficient data on the distinctive characteristics of Adv infections in immunocompetent patients is currently unavailable . We previously observed that adenoviruspositive community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) patients have a high fever and respond differently to antipyretic treatment compared to CAP patients who test positive for other viruses or bacteria . Therefore , the primary goal of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of Adv - and Non - Adv - positive CAP patients among immunocompetent military personnel and to identify the distinctive characteristics .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 227}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 360}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 362, "end": 366}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 395}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 460}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 644}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
