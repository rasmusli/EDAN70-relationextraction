It has been estimated that among its 14 . 9 million inhabitants , each year more than 900 , 000 pneumonia episodes occur in children under 5 years of age , leading to almost 8 , 000 deaths annually [ 7 ] . A previous descriptive study reported that pneumonia was the most frequent cause of admission , representing 18 % of total hospital admissions [ 8 ] . However , detailed information was not available on clinical presentation and on the etiology of suspected pneumonia cases [ 8 ] . Moreover , no control group was included . The presence of a control group of children without pneumonia would allow better interpretation of microbiological findings , particularly with nasal sampling [ 9 ] . In March 2011 , Mali included pneumococcal vaccination ( PCV13 ) in a routine immunization program ; but vaccine coverage is still low [ 10 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 311}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 464}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 669, "end": 679}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 798}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
