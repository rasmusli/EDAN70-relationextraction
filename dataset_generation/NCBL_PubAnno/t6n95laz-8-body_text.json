SCX was performed to remove excess iTRAQ reagents and interfering substances for the mass analysis . The labeled peptides were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 200 ml Buffer A , prior to being loaded on a Phenomenex Luna 55 \u00b5m SCX 100A column [ 250x4 . 60 mm ( length x internal diameter ) , 5 \u00b5m ; Phenomenex , Inc . , Torrance , CA , USA ] on an Agilent 1100 HPLC unit ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Buffer A consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 25 % acetonitrile at pH 3 . 0 , while Buffer B consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 25 % acetonitrile and 2 M KCl at pH 3 . 0 . The 60 min gradient comprised 100 % Buffer A for 30 min , 0 - 5 % Buffer B for 1 min , 5 - 30 % Buffer B for 15 min , 30 - 50 % Buffer B for 5 min , 50 % Buffer B for 4 min and 50 - 100 % Buffer A for Table II . Clinical characteristics of the nine serum samples for western blotting verification . 5 min . Thirteen fractions were collected using a Foxy JR Fraction Collector ( Dionex Corp . , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . Fractions 2 and 3 were pooled according to the chromatogram profile , based on the peak intensity . All fractions were then dried in a vacuum concentrator and stored at - 20 [UNK] C , prior to further analysis using mass spectrometry .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
