Taken together , these activities represent a coordinated strategy to advance scientific knowledge and capacity around transboundary zoonotic disease emergence and bat conservation in Western Asia . Additionally , WAB - Net has formed an initial Scientific Advisory Board ( SAB ) to help guide and oversee the network , comprised of a group of global experts with backgrounds in bat ecology and conservation , virology and laboratory diagnostics , and wildlife disease ecology . The SAB was formed to review proposed scientific activities , provide expertise during annual data sharing and capacity building workshops , monitor the network ' s growth and communication , and help liaise with regional and global stakeholders .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 672, "end": 703}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1014}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
