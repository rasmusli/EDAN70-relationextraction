{"cord_uid": "987w6ypg", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4251951", "divid": "8", "text": "Given that IFITMs are typical interferon - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) and that the signature of a broad antiviral type I interferon response accompanies HIV - 1 replication both in vivo and ex vivo [ 27 , 28 ] , we reasoned that IFITMs may be present not only in target cells , but also in virus - producing cells during the de novo assembly of virion particles . Therefore , we explored the role that IFITMs may play in HIV - 1 producing cells . The results we have obtained indicate that IFITMs coalesce with the structural protein Gag and are incorporated into HIV - 1 viral particles both in established cell lines , as well as in primary human monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM ) . Virions incorporating IFITMs display decreased infectivity when compared to HIV - 1 wild type particles in single round infection assays and a similar inhibition is observed for different retroviruses and Envelope ( Env ) pseudotypes . Virions incorporating IFITMs display a defect at the step of viral entry into target cells that well correlates with the infectivity defect measured here .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
