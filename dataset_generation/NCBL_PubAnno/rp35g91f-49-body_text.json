{"cord_uid": "rp35g91f", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC5592927", "divid": "49", "text": "Taken together , a model is proposed whereby hemodynamic stress triggers mechanosensory ( stretch - stress ) signaling from the sarcomere and initiates NO signaling cascades from the adjacent pulmonary epithelia , which are transmitted back to the pulmonary myocardium myocyte nuclei ( Figure 5 ) . This leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression , enabling fine - tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium , such as the rate and force of contraction , as well as influencing blood volume , ion transport , and hormone signaling . Our findings indicate that genetic variability at these loci can modify levels of gene expression in the pulmonary myocardium , and could modify venous return to the left atrium as well as pathological features such as hypertrophy , fibrosis , and initiation of ectopic beats . Hence the genes / loci identified in this study could be linked to atrial fibrillation in humans triggered by pulmonary events . Indeed , these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various heart diseases ( dilated cardiomyopathy , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , and arrhythmia ) and are therefore viable candidates for involvement in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 777, "end": 789}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 791, "end": 800}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 903, "end": 923}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 1055, "end": 1070}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1095}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1097, "end": 1125}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1131, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1239}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
