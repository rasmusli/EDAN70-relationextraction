The clinical significance of microbial detection by PCR is problematic at the individual level because most detected pathogens are not causes of pneumonia . However , number of pathogens is predictive of the risk of pneumonia , suggesting that simple quantification of species detected would permit the evaluation of pneumonia risk . At the population level , nasal samples are interesting because the prevalence of carriage in the controls is considered .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 60}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 248}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 319}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 420}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
