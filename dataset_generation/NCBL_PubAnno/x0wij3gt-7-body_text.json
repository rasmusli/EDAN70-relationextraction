As an upstream regulator of AKT , PDK1 signaling is thought to play a key role in cancer cell growth , survival and tumor angiogenesis [ 10 , 11 ] . Studies have shown high levels of activated PDK1 in a large percentage of common tumor types , including melanoma , breast , lung , gastric , prostate , hematological , and ovarian cancers [ 12 ] . When activated in tumor cells , Akt also has multiple effects that promote disease progression , including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation , metabolism , and angiogenesis [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] . Thus , the PDK1 / Akt signaling pathway represents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of cancer . However , the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear . Here , we explore the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and the intracellular signals involved in this process . Our studies show that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through the EP4 receptor and activation of c - Jun , which increases the expression of PDK1 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 407}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 440}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 554}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 656}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 683, "end": 689}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 816, "end": 822}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1063}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
