By performing a pulse chase assay , using [ 35 S ] - cys / met labeling mix , the half - life of I\u03baB\u03b1 in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes , whereas in cells expressing both IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 , approximately 15 % of Heterologous expression of ORF2 protein inhibits NF - \u03baB activity . ( A ) Huh7 cells were cotransfected in duplicate with NF - \u03baB CAT reporter and pSGI vector or pSGI - ORF2 expression plasmid . 48 hour post transfection , cells were treated with 100 ng / ml TPA for 30 minutes and CAT activity was assayed . Spot intensity was quantified using NIH Image program and percentage CAT activity was calculated assuming the highest value as 100 % .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
