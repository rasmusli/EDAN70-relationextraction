However , this observation does formally excludes that rhinovirus could play a role in the etiology of pneumonia . Jain et al . recently observed that rhinovirus was detected in 27 % of U . S . children with community - pneumonia requiring hospitalization [ 27 ] ; this large study had however no control group , it was also not possible to estimate the prevalence of respiratory detection in children without pneumonia . Growing evidence suggests the role of rhinovirus in the etiology of viral pneumonia [ 28 ] or related to the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia [ 29 ] . Other viruses , such as bocavirus or adenovirus were also equally prevalent in cases and controls . Again , this finding does not exclude completely their implication in pneumonia etiology in children from Mali . However these viruses were poorly described as causative agents of pneumonia in children from other sub - Saharan African countries .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 52}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 257}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 374}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 564}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 634, "end": 650}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 693, "end": 713}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 902}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1002, "end": 1012}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
