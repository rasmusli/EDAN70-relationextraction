This vector was inducible by NF - \u03baB activating agents like TPA or IL - 1\u03b2 . Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF - \u03baB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids . Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF - \u03baB CAT activity ( Figure 1A ) . However , no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression ( Figure 1A ) . In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF - \u03baB activity was an artifact of the experimental system , cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( TPA ) , a known inducer of NF - \u03baB activity [ 11 ] , or transfected with an expression construct of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 , which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF - \u03baB activity [ 12 ] . TPA treatment increased NF - \u03baB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF - \u03baB activity ( Figure 1A ) . Similarly , co - expression of ORF2 in IKK\u03b2 transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF - \u03baB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKK\u03b2 ( Figure 1B ) . These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF - \u03baB activity .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
