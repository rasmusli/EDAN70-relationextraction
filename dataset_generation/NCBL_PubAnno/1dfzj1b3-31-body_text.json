This coloured complex , which absorbs at 532 nm , results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment . This method is not very specific , because 4 - hydroxyalkenals , 2 , 4 - alkadienals and 2 - alkenals , protein and sugar degradation products , amino acids , nucleic acids and anthocyanins are also able to react with TBA , forming a chromophore [ 5 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
