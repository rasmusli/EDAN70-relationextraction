Therefore , by necessity , recombinant ZIKV - Env protein ( rZIKV - E ) was generated to support the assays performed in this study . To generate this reagent , a consensus ZIKV - Env sequence based on the ZIKV - prME vaccine consensus antigen was cloned into a pET30a Escherichia coli expression vector ( Supplementary Figure S2A ) . The rZIKV - E antigen was produced in E . coli cultures , purified using nickel column chromatography and analysed using SDS - PAGE , which showed overexpressed proteins of the predicted size in lysate from rZIKV - E transfected bacteria that could be detected by western analysis using an anti - His tag antibody ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . The sera from mice immunised with the ZIKV - prME vaccine bound to rZIKV - Env that was used as a capture antigen in an ELISA ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; Supplementary Figure S2C ) . A commercial antibody ( designated panflavivirus ) that reacts to the Env protein of multiple flaviviruses , also bound to rZIKV - E . Western analysis demonstrated that immune sera from ZIKV - prME immunised mice specifically recognised rZIKV - E ( Supplementary Figure S2D ) . These data indicate that the generated rZIKV - E reacted specifically with immune sera from ZIKV - prME vaccinated mice , thus this recombinant protein was used for further immunogenicity studies .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
