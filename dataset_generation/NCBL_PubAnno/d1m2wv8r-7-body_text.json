Currently , the clinical application of several chemotherapeutic agents is limited because of their severe toxic effects to healthy cells . Anti - cancer therapy using a virus that can selectively target cancer cells has become a popular approach . CPV is a virus that can be potentially used to treat cancer 13 . A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 can lead to regression of skin tumours in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14 . Moreover , the CPV NS1 protein shows anti - tumour activity in a mouse mammary tumour model , and it further stimulates the immune cells to attack the tumour 15 .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 159}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 365, "end": 372}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 473}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 555}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 700, "end": 715}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 787}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
