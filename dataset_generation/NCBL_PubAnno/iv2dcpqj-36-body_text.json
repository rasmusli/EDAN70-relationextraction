Belsham , was used , which contains the firefly luciferase ( Fluc ) gene under the control of the T7 promoter and the renilla luciferase ( Rluc ) gene under the control of the CSFV IRES . The plasmid pLXSN - T7 expressing the T7 RNA polymerase [ 41 ] was also used in the assay . For the luciferase reporter assay , HEK293T cells grown on 24 - well plates were cotransfected with 750 ng of pFluc / IRES / Rluc , 300 ng of pLXSN - T7 and different amounts of [UNK] - NS5A or pMyc - eEF1A . After 48 - h incubation , the reporter gene activity was analyzed with a dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( catalog no . E1910 ; Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) and measured with the TD - 20 / 20 Luminometer ( Turner Designs , Morgan Hill , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The data represent the Rluc activity normalized to the Fluc activity . Three independent experiments were carried out in duplicates .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
