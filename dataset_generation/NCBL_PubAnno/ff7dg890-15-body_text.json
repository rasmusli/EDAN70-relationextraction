First , we document systematic differences in the model parameters estimated from an epidemic using the exponential and gamma - distributed models . Second , we demonstrate that the use of exponential models produces overoptimistic predictions about the low levels of control required to subdue an epidemic .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
