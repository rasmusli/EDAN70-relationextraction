In unstimulated cells , the NF - \u03baB dimers ( p50 / p65 heterodimer or p50 / p50 homodimer ) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B ( I\u03baB ) . Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - \u03b1 ) , interleukin 1 ( IL - 1 ) , CD40L , lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) etc . , signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the I\u03baB kinases ( IKKs ) which phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1 , leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex . The degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 exposes the p50 / p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF - \u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus , bind to \u03baB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes , and regulate their transcription [ 1 ] .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 462, "end": 468}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
