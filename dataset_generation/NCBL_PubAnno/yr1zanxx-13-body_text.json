Cells were stained with antibodies , as indicated for 15 min at 22 \u00b0 C , then washed thrice with dPBS , and fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Data were collected with a BD LSR Fortessa X - 20 flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software . Flow cytometry antibodies with goat - anti - rabbit - AF488 ( 4 \u03bcg / ml , Invitrogen , Cat A11008 ) , counterstained with 1 \u03bcg / ml DAPI , and coverslipped with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant ( Thermo - Fisher , Cat P36930 ) . Z - stack images ( seven images separated by 1 \u03bcm ) were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser - scanning confocal microscope at \u00d7 40 objective magnification then compressed into a maximum intensity projection with accompanying software . For each region of each mouse , three to six images were taken from two different sagittal sections spaced at least 50 \u03bcm apart . The number of DAPI - positive nuclei also positive for NeuN and Tunel were counted by an individual blinded to the conditions .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": []}
