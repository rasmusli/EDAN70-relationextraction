{"cord_uid": "h145cxlp", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4683816", "divid": "27", "text": "To our knowledge , our study is the first in Europe to investigate paediatric influenza in PICU patients during the first three post - pandemic seasons after the 2009 / 10 pandemic . The strengths of our study include the multicentre design covering the majority of PICUs in Bavaria , the active screening for influenza in patients admitted to PICUs , and PCR - confirmation of all influenza cases . A limitation is that the corrected incidence estimates were based on the assumption that participating and nonparticipating PICUs treated a similar number of severe paediatric influenza patients . Although PICUs of both groups were of similar size , some of the non - participating PICUs , where paediatricians indicated lack of time as reason for non - participation , may have treated a higher number of patients , or patients with higher acuity . Further limitations include potential over - and underreporting in participating PICUs . On the one hand , due to different hospitalization rules some children may have been admitted to PICUs mainly for the purpose of monitoring their course of influenza disease more closely , thus resulting in an overestimate of severe cases . On the other hand , some parents of children with severe influenza may have refused study participation , or children with a fulminant course of influenza disease may have died before they were admitted to a PICU [ 4 ] . Thus , the high incidence estimates derived in this study may still underestimate the true burden of severe influenza . [ 19 ] b Key data from this study were pooled with data from Streng et al . 2011 [ 18 ] and compared using Fisher ' s Exact test or Mann - Whitney U - test , respectively", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 88}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 96}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 320}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 392}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 565, "end": 586}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 1095, "end": 1105}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1247}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 1325, "end": 1343}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 1502, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
