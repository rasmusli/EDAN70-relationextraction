{"cord_uid": "54lx7cl3", "sourcedb": "PMC", "sourceid": "PMC4801059", "divid": "15", "text": "The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide : most of the deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia [ 53 , 54 ] . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , bacterial coinfection was detected in 18 - 34 % of influenza cases ( reviewed by Chertow and Memoli [ 8 ] ) with vulnerability peaking 1 week after influenza infection [ 55 ] . The association of viral infection and bacterial pneumonia is not limited to influenza although that interaction has been most studied : adenovirus , human metapneumovirus , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , and other viruses have been temporally associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) , defined as the isolation of S . pneumoniae from a normally sterile site , in the USA ( Table 2 ) [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] . The majority of US studies suggest strong associations between S . pneumoniae infections ( both pneumonia and IPD ) and influenza virus and RSV , with potential effect modification by age . Temporal associations with other viruses are less supported and limited to IPD . We did not find any studies in the USA that examined temporal associations between viruses and bacterial species other than S . pneumoniae . Six studies conducted in other developed countries examined temporal associations between respiratory viruses and IPD [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] . Three out of five studies that examined influenza virus found associations with IPD in UK , The Netherlands and Sweden [ 70 , 71 , 73 ] . Among four studies that examined RSV in other countries , two indicated associations with IPD in all age groups [ 70 , 71 ] , one found an association only among children [ 68 ] and the last observed an association only in individuals 2 years or older [ 69 ] . Temporal associations provide evidence of virusbacterial interactions , but do not necessarily prove these interactions exist . Many viral infections are seasonal , as is pneumonia infection , so the temporal associations may merely reflect the influence of other seasonal phenomena , environmental or host , that are shared by both viral infection and pneumonia [ 74 ] . However , evidence for true virus - bacterial interactions is supported by population studies that estimate a high prevalence of viral co - infection during pneumonia [ 5 , 6 ] and animal models that suggest increased susceptibility to pneumonia and increased disease severity during viral co - infection [ 75 ] . In the USA , 47 % of children and 19 % of adults with bacterial pneumonia are co - infected with one or more viruses [ 5 , 6 ] . Further , vaccination for S . pneumoniae reduced pneumonia associated with RSV , influenza A and parainfluenza ( PIV ) types 1 - 3 [ 76 ] . Influenza vaccine probe studies may provide additional insight to the burden of influenza co - infection on bacterial pneumonia .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": "A-biobert_T1", "span": {"begin": 17, "end": 21}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T2", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 136}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T3", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 243}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T4", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 350}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T5", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 394}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T6", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 418}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T7", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 446}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T8", "span": {"begin": 533, "end": 561}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T9", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 670}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T10", "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 704}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T11", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 710}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T12", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 986}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T13", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 1003}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T14", "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1011}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T15", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1033}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T16", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1166}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T17", "span": {"begin": 1423, "end": 1427}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T18", "span": {"begin": 1551, "end": 1555}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T19", "span": {"begin": 1699, "end": 1703}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T20", "span": {"begin": 2003, "end": 2009}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T21", "span": {"begin": 2041, "end": 2061}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T22", "span": {"begin": 2203, "end": 2219}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T23", "span": {"begin": 2223, "end": 2233}, "obj": "Disease"}, {"id": "A-biobert_T24", "span": {"begin": 2399, "end": 2409}, "obj": "Disease"}]}
