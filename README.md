# NLP-relationextraction
BioNLP project in collaboration with 10 other students and Aits Lab for the course EDAN70 - Computer Science Project. 

The project is based from the kaggle competition about COVID-19: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge.

Together with Viktor Bard my contribution to the project was relationship extraction between different entities using BioBERT:
